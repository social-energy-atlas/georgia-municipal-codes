        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE                   This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Americus, Georgia. 
                  Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1986 Code and ordinances adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the prior Code, and any ordinance included herein. 
                  The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
                  Chapter and Section Numbering System 
                  The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
                  Page Numbering System 
                  The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

                   
                  Indexes 
                  The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
                  Looseleaf Supplements 
                  A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
                  Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
                  Acknowledgments 
                  This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Senior Code Attorney, and D. J. Heath, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
                  The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Charlotte Cotton, Chief Administrative Officer, Ms. Paula Martin, City Clerk, and Mr. James Skipper, City Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

                  SUPPLEMENT HISTORY TABLE 
                  The table below allows users of this Code to quickly and accurately determine what ordinances have been considered for codification in each supplement.

                  By adding to this table with each supplement, users of this Code of Ordinances will be able to gain a more complete picture of the Code's historical evolution.

                  The city council may assess by ordinance, levy, and collect an ad valorem tax on all real and personal property within the corporate limits of the city that is subject to such taxation by the state and county.

Such taxes may be levied on both individuals and corporations who transact business in this city or who practice or offer to practice any profession or calling within the city to the extent such persons have a constitutionally sufficient nexus to this city to be so taxed. The city council may classify businesses, occupations, professions, or callings for the purpose of such taxation in any way which may be lawful and may compel the payment of such taxes as otherwise provided in this Charter.

Such fees may reflect the total cost to the city of regulating the activity or such other elements as the city may deem proper and, if unpaid, shall be collected as provided in this Charter. The city council by ordinance may establish reasonable requirements for obtaining or keeping such licenses as the public health, safety, and welfare necessitate. 
                  Sec. 6-203. - Franchises. 
                  The city council shall have the power to grant franchises for the use of this city's streets and alleys for the purposes of railroads, street railways, telephone companies, electric companies, cable television companies, gas companies, transportation companies, and other similar organizations.

If unpaid, such charges shall be collected in accord with the other provisions of this Charter. 
                  (b)  The city council by ordinance shall have the power to assess and collect development fees or impact fees upon such improvements in such manner and amount as the city council may deem necessary or proper in the exercise of its powers. 
                  Sec. 6-206. - Construction; other taxes. 
                  The city shall be empowered to levy any other tax allowed now or hereafter by law, and the specific mention of any right, power, or authority in this article shall not be construed as limiting in any way the general powers of this city to govern its local affairs. 
                  CHAPTER 3. - COLLECTION OF DELINQUENT TAXES AND FEES 

                  Sec. 6-301. - Collection of delinquent taxes and fees. 
                  The city council by ordinance may provide generally for the collection of delinquent taxes, fees, or other revenue due the city under the terms of this Charter by whatever reasonable means as are not precluded by law. This shall include providing for the dates when the taxes or fees are due, late penalties or interest, issuance and execution of fi. fas., creation and priority of liens, making delinquent taxes and fees personal debts of the persons required to pay the taxes or fees imposed, revoking city licenses for failure to pay any city taxes or fees, and providing for the assignment or transfer of tax executions. 
                  CHAPTER 4. - CITY INDEBTEDNESS 

                  Sec. 6-401. - General obligation bonds. 
                  The city council shall have the power to issue bonds for the purpose of raising revenue to carry out any project, program, or venture authorized under this Charter or the laws of the state. Such bonding authority shall be exercised in accordance with the laws governing bond issuance by municipalities in effect at the time said issue is undertaken. 
                  Sec. 6-402. - Revenue bonds. 
                  Revenue bonds may be issued by the city council as state law now or hereafter provides. Such bonds are to be paid out of any revenue produced by the project, program, or venture for which they were issued. 
                  Sec. 6-403. - Short-term notes. 
                  The city may issue short-term notes as now or hereafter provided by state law. 
                  Sec. 6-404. - Improvement bonds. 
                  (a)  In order to facilitate the financing of any municipal improvements authorized by law, the city may issue bonds of the city in the aggregate amount of assessments for the improvement then unpaid, which bond or bonds and the interest thereon shall in no event become a liability of the city or the mayor and council issuing them. 
                  (b)  These bonds shall mature at a date and bear an interest rate as the council may determine by ordinance, but in no event shall the rate of interest exceed that which the assessments are to bear. 
                  (c)  These bonds shall be signed by the mayor and attested by the city clerk and shall have the impression of the corporate seal of the city thereon and shall be payable at a place designated by ordinance. 
                  (d)  These bonds shall be designated as "improvement bonds," and shall, on the face thereof, recite the nature and location of the improvement for which they have been issued and shall recite that they are payable solely from assessments which have been levied upon the lots and tracts of land abutting upon or being the situs of the improvements. 
                  (e)  These bonds shall be sold at not less than par, and the proceeds thereof applied to the payment of the costs and expense of the improvement for which the bonds were issued, or the bonds, in the amount that shall be necessary for that purpose, may be turned over and delivered to the contractor, in respect to the improvement at par value, in payment of the amount due on the contract, and the portion thereof which shall be necessary to pay other expenses incident to and incurred in providing for the improvements shall be sold or otherwise disposed of as the council by ordinance shall direct. 
                  CHAPTER 5. - FISCAL CONTROL 

                  Sec. 6-501. - Fiscal year.

                  The city council shall provide an ordinance on the procedures and requirements for the preparation and execution of an annual budget, which shall include an annual operating budget, a capital improvement program, and a capital budget and may also include requirements as to the scope, content, and form of such budgets and programs of the city. 
                  (H.B. 425, 5-12-2015) 
                  Sec. 6-503. - Submission of operating budget to city council. 
                  On or before a date fixed by the city council but not later than 45 days prior to the beginning of each fiscal year, the city manager shall submit to the city council a proposed budget for the ensuing fiscal year, which budget shall include both an operating budget and a capital budget. The budget shall be accompanied by a message from the city manager containing a statement of the general fiscal policies of the city, the important features of the budget, explanations of major changes recommended for the next fiscal year, a general summary of the budget, and such other comments and information as he or she may deem pertinent. The proposed budget, the budget message, and all supporting documents shall be filed in the office of the city clerk and shall be open to public inspection. 
                  (H.B. 425, 5-12-2015; Ord. No. O-2015-15, 7-23-2015) 
                  Sec. 6-504. - Action by city council on budget. 
                  (a)  The city council may amend the budget proposed by the city manager, except that the budget as finally amended and adopted must provide for all expenditures required by state law or by other provisions of this charter and for all debt service requirements for the ensuing fiscal year and for all capital improvements required for the ensuing fiscal year and the total appropriations from any fund shall not exceed the estimated fund balance, reserves, and revenues. 
                  (b)  The city council by ordinance shall adopt a final budget for the ensuing fiscal year not later than the last day of the current fiscal year. If the city council fails to adopt the budget by this date, the amounts appropriated for the current fiscal year shall be deemed adopted for the ensuing fiscal year on a month-to-month basis, with all items prorated accordingly, until such time as the city council adopts a budget for the ensuing fiscal year. Adoption of the budget shall take the form of an appropriations ordinance setting out the estimated revenues in detail by sources and making appropriations according to fund and by organizational unit, purpose, or activity as set out in the budget preparation ordinance adopted pursuant to Section 6-502 of this charter. 
                  (c)  The amount set out in the adopted budget for each organizational unit shall constitute the annual appropriation for such, and no expenditure shall be made or encumbrance created in excess of the otherwise unencumbered balance of the appropriations or allotments thereof to which it is chargeable. The city council shall not authorize an expenditure for the construction of any building, structure, work, or improvement unless the appropriations for such project are included in the capital improvements budget, except to meet a public emergency as provided in this charter, or where the funds required for such improvement are otherwise provided for in accord with this charter or applicable state laws.

                  The city council shall annually levy by ordinance such taxes as are necessary to fund the budget. The taxes and tax rates set by such ordinance shall be such that reasonable estimates of revenues from such levy shall at least be sufficient, together with other budgeted revenues, fund balances, and applicable reserves, to equal the total amount appropriated for each of the several funds set forth in the annual operating budget for defraying the expenses of the general government of this city. 
                  (H.B. 425, 5-12-2015)

                  The city manager may submit amendments to the budget to the city council at any time during the fiscal year, accompanied by his or her recommendations. The city council by ordinance may make changes or amendments in the appropriations contained in the current budget at any regular meeting or special or emergency meeting called for such purpose, but any additional appropriations may be made only from an existing unexpended surplus. Any such amendments to the budget shall become effective only upon adoption by ordinance. 
                  (H.B. 425, 5-12-2015; Ord. No. O-2015-15, 7-23-2015)

                  There shall be an annual independent audit of all city accounts, funds, and financial transactions by a certified public accountant selected by the city council. The audit shall be conducted according to generally accepted accounting principles. Any audit of any funds by the state or federal government may be accepted as satisfying the requirements of this charter. Copies of all audit reports shall be available at printing costs to the public. 
                  (H.B. 425, 5-12-2015)

                  Sec. 6-604. - Sale and disposition of property. 
                  (a)  The city council may sell, lease, transfer, and convey any real or personal property owned or held by the city for governmental or other purposes as now or hereafter provided by law. 
                  (b)  The city council may quitclaim any rights it may have in property not needed for public purposes upon report by the city manager and adoption of a resolution, both finding that the property is not needed for public or other purposes and that the interest of the city has no readily ascertainable monetary value. 
                  (c)  Whenever in opening, extending, or widening any street, avenue, alley, or public place of the city a small parcel or tract of land is cut off or separated by such work from a larger tract or boundary of land owned by the city, the city council may authorize the mayor to execute and deliver in the name of the city a deed conveying said cut-off or separated parcel or tract of land to an abutting or adjoining property owner or owners in exchange for rights of way of said street, avenue, alley, or public place when such exchange is deemed to be in the best interest of the city. All deeds and conveyances heretofore and hereafter so executed and delivered shall convey all title and interest the city has in such property, notwithstanding the fact that no public sale after advertisement was or is hereafter made. 
                  (H.B. 425, 5-12-2015; Ord. No. O-2015-15, 7-23-2015)

                  The city council shall meet regularly at least once each month, at such place and time as it may fix and prescribe. Special meetings may be called by the mayor at any time for the consideration and determination of any questions or matters requiring immediate attention, of which special meeting the city clerk shall give the members notice. 
                  (Code 1962, § 2-10; Code 1986, § 2-24) 
                  Sec. 2-49. - Speaking at meetings; decorum at meetings; notices to city council from members of the public; disturbing or interrupting meetings; violations. 
                  (a)  Monthly public meetings of city council and city council committees. Unless otherwise provided by a majority vote of the city council, the mayor and city council shall meet at least two times each calendar month. The first meeting shall be an agenda setting meeting and the second meeting shall be the regular monthly meeting. Such meetings shall be at such times and dates as established by the city council from time to time. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prohibit called meetings otherwise allowed by law; nor shall any provision of this subsection be construed to require that both meetings be held each calendar month if a majority of the city council agrees to dispense with one of such meetings; provided, however, that, unless prevented by circumstances or events beyond the control of the mayor and city council, the mayor and city council shall have at least a regular monthly meeting each calendar month. All meetings of the mayor and city council shall be held and conducted under the provisions of the Georgia Open Meetings Act. 
                  (b)  Meeting agenda. At least 48 hours prior to each meeting of the mayor and city council, or any committee thereof, the city clerk, or the designee thereof, shall publish an agenda of the matters anticipated to be considered or discussed at the meeting. The fact that a particular matter is not included on the published agenda shall not prevent the matter from being considered, provided that a majority of the city council or the council committee, as the case may be, adopts a motion approving the addition of the matter to the agenda at any time during the meeting. 
                  (c)  Public hearings. At each meeting of the mayor and city council, or any committee thereof, when the mayor and city council or a committee of the city council is conducting a public hearing in accord with the requirements of federal, state or local laws, regulations, or ordinances, any person desiring to address the mayor and city council or a committee of city council during such public hearing regarding the subject matter of the public hearing shall be authorized to do so. Such person must be recognized by the presiding officer prior to speaking at the public hearing. Comments by persons speaking during the public hearing shall be directed to the presiding officer, and not to individual members of the city council, and unless otherwise provided by state law or local ordinance, the comments of such person addressing a public hearing shall be limited to five minutes per person. Any person speaking during a public hearing shall limit his or her comments to the subject matter of the public hearing, and any statements or comments made by such person not related to the subject matter of the public hearing shall be immediately ruled out of order by the presiding officer. At the conclusion of the time to speak at such public hearing, each speaker shall terminate his or her remarks. 
                  (d)  Agenda items. At any regular monthly meeting of the city council, members of the public desiring to address the mayor and city council regarding items that appear on the published city council agenda shall personally sign up to do so at the meeting location on the day of the meeting as long as such person signs up to speak prior to the time that the meeting is called to order by the presiding officer. A person signing up to speak on an agenda item must indicate the item on which such person desires to address the mayor and city council by reference to the meeting agenda at the time such person signs up to speak. The city clerk, or his or her designee, shall provide a sign-up sheet for such purposes at least 30 minutes prior to the scheduled starting time of the meeting. Such sign-up sheet shall be located on the lectern provided for speakers at the meeting. No more than a total of five speakers can sign up to speak at any one meeting, and each speaker shall be provided three minutes to address the mayor and city council regarding the agenda item or items to be addressed by such speaker. A speaker can sign up to address more than one agenda item, but the number of agenda items to be addressed by a speaker shall not affect the total amount of time allotted for each individual speaker. If more than a total of five speakers sign up to speak at any one meeting, the presiding officer shall only be authorized to recognize the first five persons who signed up to speak. No person shall be authorized to sign up for another person to speak and no speaker shall be authorized to yield any portion of his or her unused time to another person. In the event that there are a large number of persons who desire to speak on a particular agenda item, the presiding officer may request that the persons wishing to speak on the agenda item select a spokesperson to address the mayor and city council on behalf of such persons. A person speaking to the mayor and city council on an agenda item shall only be authorized to speak on such agenda item and any statements or comments made by such person not related to the agenda item upon which such person is authorized to speak shall be immediately ruled out of order by the presiding officer, and if a speaker continues to speak on matters not related to the agenda item upon which such person is authorized to speak after being ruled out of order by the presiding officer, then such person may be removed from the meeting and charged with violation of this section. Comments by persons speaking on an agenda item shall be directed to the presiding officer, and not to individual members of the city council. Any speaker addressing individual member of the city council shall be ruled out of order by the presiding officer, and if such speaker continues to address individual members of the city council after being ruled out of order for doing so by the presiding officer, then such person may be removed from the meeting and charged with violation of this section. At the conclusion of the time to speak on such agenda item, each speaker shall terminate his or her remarks. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require a person to sign up to speak in connection with a public hearing to be conducted by the mayor and city council under subsection (c) of this section. 
                  (e)  Non-agenda items. Members of the public desiring to bring any matter concerning the city to the attention of the city council which does not appear on a meeting agenda of the mayor and city council may submit such person's comments in writing to the city manager of the city at any time during which the city council or a council committee is not in an administrative briefing, an agenda setting meeting, or in a regular monthly meeting. Copies of such written comments from a member of the public shall be submitted to the mayor and city council within ten calendar days of the date such comments are submitted to the city manager. In the event that at least three members of the city council deem it appropriate to include issues or comments submitted to the city manager under this section on the agenda of a subsequent meeting of the mayor and city council, then, at least three calendar days prior to the meeting of the city council at which such members desire that such item be placed upon the agenda, such three members shall submit a notice to the city manager, either jointly or severally, to place such item on such city council meeting agenda for consideration by the mayor and city council; provided, however, that unless such matter is tabled or otherwise postponed by action of the governing body, no such item shall be placed on an agenda of the city council more than one time every six months. 
                  (f)  Meeting decorum. In order to ensure proper decorum and a businesslike atmosphere at all meetings of the city council or any committee thereof, no signs, placards, or similar displays that are larger than 17 inches by 24 inches, or that are attached to sticks, rods or poles or that are constructed of metal or wood shall be allowed within the city council chambers or in a city council meeting room during a city council or committee meeting unless the sign specifically illustrates, depicts or describes in the form of a map, plat, schematic drawing, picture, or similar depiction, a particular item that appears on the meeting agenda as an item for consideration by the city council or a committee thereof. In addition to the foregoing, any such sign, placard, or similar display that is otherwise authorized hereunder shall not be placed or displayed in a location or in a manner which blocks the view of any member of the audience, city staff, or the council. Any signs, placards, or similar displays that are prohibited hereunder, or any sign that is otherwise authorized hereunder which blocks a person's view as prohibited herein during the course of a meeting, shall be removed by the person carrying the sign upon request of the presiding officer or by an appropriate officer of the police department upon direction of the presiding officer. 
                  (g)  Violations of ordinance. It shall be unlawful for any person to violate the provisions of this section or for any person to disturb or interrupt any meeting of the city council or a committee thereof. The use of obscene or profane language, physical violence, or the threat thereof, or loud and boisterous behavior which the presiding officer shall determine is intended as a disruption of the meeting, or any failure to comply with any lawful decision or order of the presiding officer in connection with or during the course of a meeting, shall constitute a disturbance hereunder, and shall be considered to be a violation of this section. Any person violating the provisions of this section, including a person violating this section by creating a disturbance as defined herein, or by failing or refusing to comply with a lawful order of the presiding officer during a meeting of the mayor and city council or a committee thereof, may be ordered removed or ejected from the city council chambers or other meeting room by the presiding officer for the duration of the meeting or for such lesser period as the presiding officer shall determine. In addition, any person violating the provisions of this section shall, upon conviction thereof, be subject to punishment as provided in section 1-8 of this Code.

A motion to excuse a member from voting may be made by the council member seeking to be excused, must be made before the question is put to a vote, and shall be decided without debate, except that the council member making the motion may state briefly the reasons that the motion was made.

                  Sec. 2-144. - Policy for an economic development loan fund. 
                  There is hereby established a policy for the administration of the economic development revolving loan fund of the city, to be applicable to the downtown area or coextensive with the boundary of the downtown development authority area of the city. 
                  (1)  Source of funds. The economic development loan fund shall consist of federal grants from the Department of Housing and Urban Development of the United States of America, program or miscellaneous income, and such other funds as may be available therefor. 
                  (2)  Object of benefit. Loan funds shall be used primarily to benefit the city's low-income and moderate-income population through economic development of the central business district within the downtown development authority boundaries. 
                  (3)  Security. Security for the repayment of all loan funds shall consist of a first or second security interest in the borrower's assets (whether real or personal property) being financed by such loan proceeds, or a security interest in whatever assets of the borrower that the city council may require in order to fully secure the economic development loan. Loans to a corporation shall be personally guaranteed by the shareholders of the corporation. If the borrower is not the owner of the real property to be improved with said loan funds, then, unless otherwise authorized by the city council, the owner of said real property shall guarantee repayment of said loan to the city and shall secure such guarantee by execution and delivery of a deed to secure debt with respect to such real property to the city. 
                  (4)  Annual interest rate. The interest rate shall be four percent per annum or such other interest rates that may be adopted in the future. 
                  (5)  Maximum loan amount. The maximum loan amount shall be $25,000.00; provided, however, under special circumstances whereby the city council in its sole discretion deems a larger loan is necessary to expedite the downtown development authority program in a timely manner or to bring an individual loan proposal package to completion, said maximum loan amount may be exceeded by the city council. The maximum loan amount shall not exceed 80 percent of the cost of the improvements financed by the loan. 
                  (6)  Use of loan funds. The use of loan funds shall be limited to: 
                  a.  Facade improvements, including signage. Historic preservation commission approval shall be obtained where required by ordinance. 
                  b.  Interior or exterior structural improvements, including roof, heating/air, plumbing and electrical systems or improvements thereto. Such systems and improvements shall become fixtures and remain with the property. 
                  c.  Provision of financial assistance by way of a loan for start-up operating costs and working capital. Start-up operating costs and working capital shall be limited to $10,000.00. The applicant shall provide all documentary information regarding the ownership of collateral and the market value of the collateral to be used as collateral in connection with the loan for start-up operating costs and working capital. The city shall be authorized to require an appraisal of such proposed collateral at the expense of the applicant, and the city shall be authorized to reject such loan application should such appraisal, if conducted, show that the proposed collateral is of insufficient value, as determined in the sole discretion of the city council, to properly collateralize the proposed loan. 
                  (7)  Length of loan. No loan may be amortized or repaid over more than ten years. 
                  (8)  Availability of loans. Loans shall only be made as funds are available to the city council from the economic development loan fund for such loans. 
                  (9)  Priority. 
                  a.  The priority for loan funds is the financing of projects that show job creation or job retention, especially jobs which employ low-income and moderate-income persons. In addition, for economic redevelopment activities, a commitment must be made by the recipient of the loan that 51 percent of the jobs created or retained by the economic development activities financed by the loan shall be reserved for low-income and moderate-income persons. 
                  b.  An equal priority for loan funds is the financing of projects that will benefit low-income and moderate-income persons. Such benefits shall include, but shall not necessarily be limited to, the financing of a project to construct or renovate a structure to be used for job training for low-income and moderate-income persons. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it shall be sufficient if the recipient of the loan makes a written commitment to the city, where such written commitment is not prohibited by law, that of the persons benefited by the project, at least 51 percent of them will be low-income and moderate-income persons. 
                  c.  For the purposes of this section, the terms "low-income persons" and "moderate-income persons" shall be defined the same as they are periodically defined by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
                  (10)  Selection of projects. The loan review committee shall act as agent for the city in determining the selection of projects to be financed. The city council shall have final approval of all such loans and all agreements made in connection therewith. 
                  (11)  Responsibility and authority over final selection. None of the policies stated herein shall be construed to restrict the city council from having full responsibility and authority over the final project selection to be financed by the downtown development authority revolving loan fund. 
                  (12)  Repayment.

                  Sec. 6-3. - Compliance required. 
                  (a)  It shall be unlawful for any person to sell or offer for sale wholesale or retail any alcoholic beverages without having first complied with the provisions of this chapter. 
                  (b)  The city shall have the authority to conduct an audit of the books and records of any licensee and/or require regular reporting of the books and records of any licensee to assure licensee's compliance with the provisions of this chapter. In such event, the city shall notify the licensee of the date, time and place of the audit or reporting requirements. In conducting such audit, the city may require the licensee to provide the books and records in electronic form if such books or records are maintained, in the regular course of business by the licensee, in electronic form. 
                  (c)  Some of the business operations described in this chapter must, to continue operating as that type of business, maintain: 
                  (1)  In the case of an indoor entertainment hall, 25 percent of its total annual gross sales from the sale of prepared meals or foods, admission charges, ticket sales, sale of merchandise, vending sales, attendance fees, or other recreational, promotional, or operational activities. 
                  (2)  In the case of a grocery store, the sales of alcoholic beverages do not exceed five percent of its total gross sales. 
                  (3)  In the case of a restaurant, the licensee must derive a minimum of 50 percent of its total annual gross food and beverage sales, over any 12-month period of time, from the sale of prepared meals or food. 
                  (d)  In determining whether these entities have complied with these percentages, the city shall be entitled to audit the books and records of the entities. The following shall be applicable to such audits: 
                  (1)  If the business has operated as that type of entity (e.g., a restaurant) for 12 months or more prior to the date on which the audit is commenced, the auditor shall consider the annual gross food and beverage sales, or the annual gross sales, or total gross sales, as the case may be, during the 12 months preceding the date on which the audit is commenced to determine whether the entity has maintained the required percentage set forth in the definition of that entity found in this chapter. 
                  (2)  If the business has operated as that type of entity for less than 12 months prior to the date on which the audit is commenced, the auditor shall consider the annual gross food and beverage sales, or the annual gross sales, or total gross sales, as the case may be, during the time that the business has operated as that type of entity to determine whether the entity has maintained the required percentage set forth in the definition of that entity found in this chapter. 
                  (3)  If the entity operated as one type of entity, e.g., a bar as defined in this chapter, and changed to another type of entity, e.g., a restaurant as defined in this chapter, the audit shall consider only the annual gross food and beverage sales, or the annual gross sales, or total gross sales, as the case may be, during the period it operated after the change of the type of entity to determine whether the entity has maintained the required percentage set forth in the definition of that entity found in this chapter. 
                  (4)  If the entity has failed to maintain the percentage required by the definition, the entity shall be placed on probation for a period of three months from and after the date the entity is notified of its failure to maintain the required percentage. The notification placing the entity on probation shall be in writing and provide the percentages determined as part of the audit. During that probationary time period, the entity can attempt to attain the percentage required by the definition for that entity. At the end of the probationary period, a second audit will be conducted. The second audit will audit only the annual gross food and beverage sales, or annual gross sales, or total gross sales, as the case may be, during the probationary period and whether the entity attained the percentage required by the definition for that entity during the probationary period. Should the entity fail to attain the required percentage during the second audit, the entity will be informed, in writing, that it can no longer operate as that type of entity, e.g., a restaurant that fails to maintain the percentage required by the definition for that entity will be notified that it can no longer operate as a restaurant and may operate only as a bar. Should the licensee change its entity, for instance from a restaurant to a bar, it shall be the licensee's responsibility to assure that it complies with all the requirements of these ordinances of the city, including, but not limited to, any licensing applicable to that entity. 
                  (5)  The entity may appeal the audit decision generated by a failure to meet the required percentage during the second audit. Any such decision to appeal must be made, in writing, and filed with the license review board no later than ten calendar days from and after the entity's receipt of the decision appealed. If the results of the second audit are mailed by the auditor to the licensee, that decision of the auditor is deemed received by the licensee three days from and after the decision is mailed and an additional copy filed with the city clerk. That notice of appeal must specify, in detail, why the entity believes the audit decisions are flawed. Where a hearing is scheduled by the license review board, the entity shall be provided written notice of such hearing no less than five calendar days prior to the date scheduled for the hearing. If the license review board upholds the auditor's decision, the entity shall have the right to appeal to the city manager. Any such appeal to the city manager must be in writing and filed with the city clerk and the city manager's office no later than ten calendar days from and after date on which the entity receives the decision of the license review board. If the decision of the license review board is mailed, that decision is deemed received by the licensee three days from and after the decision is mailed. The appeal to city manager shall contain the following: a detailed explanation of why the entity believes the audit results and the decision of the license review board is flawed; statistics showing the entity has complied with the percentage contained in the definition for that entity found in this chapter; a copy of the results of the first and second audits; and, a copy of the decision of the license review board. Failure of the entity to submit all of the appeal documents shall be fatal to the appeal. It shall be within the discretion of the city manager whether a hearing will be held on the appeal. If a hearing is scheduled by the city manager of the city, the entity shall be provided written notice of such hearing no less than five calendar days prior to the date scheduled for the hearing. 
                  (6)  The appeals shall consider only evidence of sales during the audit periods and shall not consider evidence of any sales during the appeal periods. 
                  (7)  The entity shall be allowed to operate during the time it is appealing the decision of the audit.

                  Whereas, Article III, Section VI, Paragraph VII of the Constitution of the State of Georgia, delegates authority to counties and municipalities "for the purpose of regulating, restricting, or prohibiting the exhibition of nudity, partial nudity, or depictions of nudity in connection with the sale or consumption of alcoholic beverages;" and, 
                  Whereas, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit has upheld a municipal ordinance prohibiting the serving or consumption of alcoholic beverages in adult entertainment establishments; and, 
                  Whereas, the Supreme Court of Georgia has upheld a municipal ordinance prohibiting the serving or consumption of alcoholic beverages in adult entertainment establishments; and, 
                  Whereas, among the undesirable community conditions identified with live nude entertainment and alcohol are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhood, increased expenditure for the allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order; increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior, and acceleration of community blight; Daytona Grand, Inc. v. City of Daytona Beach, 490 F.3d 860 (11th Cir. 2007); 5634 East Hillsborough Ave., Inc. v. Hillsborough County, 2007 WL 2936211 (M.D. Fla. Oct. 4, 2007), affd, 2008 WL 4279670 (11th Cir. Sept. 18, 2008) (per curium); California v. LaRue, 409 U.S. 109 (1972); N Y. State Liquor Authority v. Bellanca, 452 U.S. 714 (1981); and, 
                  Whereas, the Supreme Court of Georgia, in Chambers d/b/a Neon Cowboy v. Peach County, Georgia, 266 Ga. 318, 467 S.E.2d 519 (1996), held that local governments may adopt ordinances designed to combat the undesirable secondary effects of sexually explicit businesses, and further held that a governing authority seeking to regulate adult entertainment establishments must have evidence of a relationship between the proposed regulation and the undesirable secondary effects it seeks to control. The Georgia Supreme Court further held in the same opinion that in passing its regulations, a local government may rely on the experience of other counties and municipalities to demonstrate such a relationship; and, 
                  Whereas, the United States Supreme Court, in City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986), held that a local government may rely on the experience of other Cities in enacting legislation to regulate adult entertainment businesses; and, 
                  Whereas, Federal and State appellate courts, have previously held that before enacting an ordinance to combat undesirable secondary effects of adult entertainment, a legislative body is required to consider specific evidence of the undesirable secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments that it reasonably believes relevant to the interests it seeks to address by passing the ordinance; and, 
                  Whereas, based on the experiences of other municipalities and counties including, but not limited to, Fulton County, Georgia; Adams County, Colorado; New York City, New York; Indianapolis, Indiana; Dallas, Texas; Sandy Springs, Georgia; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; City of St. Mary's, Georgia; Hamilton County, Tennessee; Amarillo, Texas; Rome, Georgia; Gwinnett County, Georgia; Austin, Texas; Phoenix, Arizona; Manatee County, Florida; City of Garden Grove, California; Forth Worth, Texas; Houston, Texas; St. Cloud, Minnesota; Whittier, California; and the City of Los Angeles, California, which are found to be relevant to the problems faced by the City of Americus, the Mayor and City Council of the City of Americus note the documented negative economic, physical, and social impact adult entertainment businesses have on the community; and, 
                  Whereas, based upon the experience of other urban counties and municipalities, which experiences the mayor and city council of the city find are relevant to the problems faced by the city, and which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within this country, the mayor and city council of the city find that public nudity, under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in adult entertainment establishments offering adult entertainment, begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions.

                  Whereas, the mayor and city council of the city find and declare that nudity and sexual conduct and depiction thereof, coupled with alcohol in public places, encourages undesirable behavior and is not in the interest of public health, safety, and welfare; and, 
                  Whereas, the mayor and city council of the city have chosen to avoid the disturbances associated with mixing alcohol and nude dancing by means of a reasonable restriction upon establishments which sell spirituous or vinous liquors or malt or brewed beverages; and, 
                  Whereas, the ordinance furthers important governmental interests of reducing crime and protecting property values which are unrelated to the suppression of speech; and, 
                  Whereas, it is the intent of the mayor and city council of the city to enact an ordinance, narrowly tailored, sufficient to combat the undesirable secondary effects of the serving and consumption of alcoholic beverages at adult entertainment facilities; and, 
                  Whereas, it is not the intent of the mayor and city council of the city, in enacting this article to deny to any person the right to speech or expression protected by the United States or Georgia Constitutions, nor it is the intent to deny or restrict the rights of any adult to obtain or view any sexually oriented performance or materials protected by the United States or Georgia Constitutions, but to adopt a content neutral ordinance to combat the undesirable secondary effects of adult entertainment where alcoholic beverages are served or consumed; and, 
                  Whereas, this section is enacted to further the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the city; 
                  Now, therefore, this section is hereby enacted to further such health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the city.

                  ARTICLE IV. - SOCIAL HOSTING 

                  Sec. 6-131. - Findings and intent. 
                  The mayor and the city council finds and declares as follows: 
                  (a)  In 2007, the U.S. Surgeon General issued a report entitled "The Surgeon General's Call to Action to Prevent and Reduce Underage Drinking," which can be found at http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/topics/underagedrinking/calltoaction.pdf. ("Surgeon General's Call to Action"). 
                  (b)  "Early alcohol consumption by some young people will result in an alcohol use disorder—that is, they will meet diagnostic criteria for either alcohol abuse or dependence." Surgeon General's Call to Action, at page four. 
                  (c)  "A higher percentage of youth in 8th, 10th, and 12th grades used alcohol in the month prior to being surveyed than used tobacco or marijuana, the illicit drug most commonly used by adolescents." Surgeon General's Call to Action, at page 5. 
                  (d)  Various surveys have found that: approximately ten percent of children who are nine to ten years old have started drinking alcoholic beverages; nearly 33 percent of youth start drinking alcoholic beverages before the age of 13; more than ten percent of youth who are 12 to 13 years old and over 33 percent of youth who are 14 to 15 years old reported drinking a whole alcoholic beverage in the year before they were surveyed, and the peak years of alcohol initiation are when youth are in 7th and 8th grades. Surgeon General's Call to Action, at page six. 
                  (e)  While adolescents typically drink alcoholic beverages less often than adults, when they do drink alcoholic beverages, adolescents tend to drink more alcoholic beverages at each event than adults. Surgeon General's Call to Action, at pages 6-7. 
                  (f)  Persons who are less than the age of 21 often possess or consume alcoholic beverages at social parties or gatherings held at or on private residences and other private property under control of a person who either has provided the alcoholic beverages or who knows or reasonably should know of such conduct, but fails to take steps to prevent it. 
                  (g)  "Annually, about 5,000 people under age 21 die from alcohol-related injuries involving underage drinking." Surgeon General's Call to Action, at page ten. 
                  (h)  Underage drinking "[plays a significant role in risky sexual behavior, including unwanted, unintended, and unprotected sexual activity, and sex with multiple partners. Such behavior increases the risk of unplanned pregnancy and for contracting sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including infection with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS." Surgeon General's Call to Action, at page ten. 
                  (i)  Underage drinking increases the risk of physical and sexual assault." Surgeon General's Call to Action, at page ten. 
                  (j)  Underage drinking "can cause a range of physical consequences, from hangovers to death from alcohol poisoning." Surgeon General's Call to Action, at page 11. 
                  (k)  Underage drinking, "can cause alterations in the structure and function of the developing brain, which continues to mature into the mid-to late twenties and may have consequences reaching far beyond adolescence." Surgeon General's Call to Action, at page 11. 
                  (l)  Underage drinking, "creates secondhand effects that can put others at risk. Loud and unruly behavior, property destruction, unintentional injuries, violence, and even death because of underage alcohol use afflict innocent parties. For instance, about 45 percent of people who die in car crashes involving a drinking driver under the age of 21 are people other than the driver." Surgeon General's Call to Action, at page 11. 
                  (m)  Law enforcement agency responses to disturbances involving underage consumption of alcoholic beverages at parties or gatherings at or on private residences or other private property frequently require the use of extensive public resources. Further, when law enforcement personnel respond to such disturbances it limits their ability to respond to other service calls in the community, thereby placing the community at increased risk. Law enforcement is not currently reimbursed for their expenses when called to a party or gathering at or on a private residence or other private property.

                  (2)  If the repair, alteration or improvement of the said dwelling, building or structure in order to bring it into full compliance with applicable codes relevant to the cited violations cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to demolish and remove such dwelling, building or structure and all debris from the property. 
                  For purposes of this section, the court shall make its determination of reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building or structure without consideration of the value of the land on which the structure is situated; provided, however, that costs of the preparation necessary to repair, alter or improve a structure may be considered; and, provided further, that if the unsatisfactory condition is limited solely to the presence of graffiti, the dwelling, building or structure shall not be ordered demolished or closed, but its owner may be ordered to repair the same by cleaning or removal of the graffiti. Income and financial status of the owner shall not be a factor in the court's determination. The present value of the structure and the costs of repair, alteration or improvement may be established by affidavits of real estate appraisers with a Georgia appraiser classification as provided in O.C.G.A. title 43, ch. 39A, qualified building contractors, or qualified building inspectors without actual testimony presented. Costs of repair, alteration or improvement of the structure shall be the cost necessary to bring the structure into compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violations in force in the jurisdiction. 
                  (d)  If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair or demolish the dwelling, building, or structure, the public officer shall cause such dwelling, building, or structure to be repaired, altered, or improved, or to be vacated and closed, or demolished within 270 days of the expiration of time specified in the order for abatement by the owner. Any time during which such action is prohibited by a court order issued pursuant to subsection (c) of this section or any equitable relief granted by a court of competent jurisdiction shall not be counted toward the 270 days in which such abatement action shall commence. The public officer shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of the building, dwelling or structure a placard with the following words: 
                  "This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business use and does not comply with the applicable codes or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with drug crimes or constitutes an endangerment to public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful." 
                  (e)  If the public officer has the structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any moneys received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. The public officer and governing authority are relieved of any and all liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials. 
                  (f)  The amount of the cost of demolition, including all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the city, and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, including restoration to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred. 
                  (g)  The lien provided for in subsection (e) shall attach to the real property upon the filing of a certified copy of the order requiring repair, closure, or demolition in the office of the Clerk of Superior Court in Sumter County and shall relate back to the date of the filing of the lis pendens notice required under subsection (a). The clerk of superior court shall record and index such certified copy of the order in the deed records of the county and enter the lien on the general execution docket. The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except liens for taxes to which the lien shall be inferior, and shall continue in force until paid. After filing a certified copy of the order with the clerk of superior court, the public officer shall, within 90 days of the completion of repairs, demolition or closure, forward a copy of the order and a final statement of costs to the city finance director. 
                  (h)  It shall be the duty of the city finance director to collect the amount of the lien in conjunction with the collection of ad valorem taxes on the property and to collect the amount of the lien as if it were a real property ad valorem tax, using all methods available for collecting real property ad valorem taxes, including specifically O.C.G.A. § 48-4-5; provided, however, that the limitation of O.C.G.A § 48-4-78 which requires 12 months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure shall not apply; provided, further, that redemption of property from the lien may be made in accordance with the provisions of O.C.G.A. §§ 48-4-80 and 48-4-81. The city finance director may initiate enforcement of liens imposed under this section at any time following receipt of the final determination of costs from the public officer, and such enforcement shall be undertaken by the city finance director in any such manner as may be authorized by Georgia law for the collection of city ad valorem taxes. The unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties from and after the date of final determination of costs in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes. In the event that the Sumter County Tax Commissioner shall have a contract with the city to collect ad valorem taxes for the city, such tax commissioner shall collect and enforce city liens imposed pursuant to this article in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 48-5-359.1. The amount collected shall be remitted to the general fund of the city. 
                  (i)  The governing authority may waive and release any such lien imposed on property upon the owner of such property entering into a contract with the municipality agreeing to a timetable for rehabilitation of the real property or the dwelling, building or structure on the property and demonstrating the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation. 
                  (j)  Review of a court order requiring the repair, alteration, improvement or demolition of a dwelling, building, or structure shall be by direct appeal to the superior court under O.C.G.A. § 5-3-29.

Copies of the complaint and summons shall also be mailed by first-class mail to the property address to the attention of the occupants, if any;

                  (b)  The public officer shall cause an affidavit of service to be filed of record in the municipal court prior to the hearing showing compliance with the service requirements of this section. Such affidavit shall constitute a prima facie showing of minimum procedural due process and shall constitute sufficient proof that service was perfected. 
                  (c)  Orders and other filings made subsequent to service of the initial complaint shall be served in the manner provided in this section on every interested party who answers the complaint or appears at the hearing. Any interested party who fails to answer or appear at the hearing shall be deemed to have waived all further notice in the proceedings.

De novo hearings shall be conducted by the superior court on petitions within 20 days of the filing thereof, the superior court shall hear and determine the issues raised and shall enter such final order or decree as law and justice may require; provided, however, that it shall not be necessary to file bond in any amount before obtaining a temporary injunction pursuant to this section.

Approval of a permit and inspection of a property shall in no manner guarantee or warrant to the owner or occupants thereof that said property has been constructed, maintained or operated in conformance with applicable codes, laws and regulations. The city reserves the right to assert all available immunities and defenses in any action seeking to impose monetary damages upon the city, its officers, employees and agents arising out of any alleged failure or breach of duty or relationship as may now exist or hereafter be created. To the extent any federal or state law, regulation or ordinance requires compliance as a condition precedent to the issuance of a permit, plan or design approval, inspection or other activity by the city, its officers, employees and agents, issuance of such permit, approval, or inspection shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver or estoppel of the condition precedent, and it shall remain the obligation and responsibility of the owner, his design professional(s), and contractor(s) to satisfy such legal requirements.

This subsection shall not preclude a police officer from arresting any individual for criminal trespass where such individual knowingly and without authority remains on private property after being notified by the owner or lawful occupant to depart.

In addition to the foregoing fines, upon conviction, the director shall discontinue the public water supply service at any premises upon which there is found to be a cross-connection, auxiliary intake, by-pass, or inter-connection, and service shall not be restored until such cross-connection, auxiliary, by-pass, or inter-connection has been discontinued.

                  (1)  Encourage the location of towers in nonresidential areas and minimize the total number of towers throughout the community; 
                  (2)  Encourage strongly the joint use of new and existing tower sites; 
                  (3)  Encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them, to the extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the community is minimal; 
                  (4)  Encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a way that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers and antennas; and 
                  (5)  Enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services to provide such services to the community quickly, effectively, and efficiently. 
                  (b)  Principal or accessory use. Antennas and towers may be considered either principal or accessory uses. A different existing use or an existing structure on the same lot shall not preclude the installation of an antenna or tower on such lot. For purposes of determining whether the installation of a tower or antenna complies with district development regulations, including but not limited to setback requirements, lot coverage requirements, and other such requirements, the dimensions of the entire lot shall control, even though the antennas or towers may be located on leased parcels within such lots. Towers that are constructed, and antennas that are installed, in accordance with the provisions of this article shall not be deemed to constitute the expansion of a nonconforming use or structure. 
                  (c)  Inventory of existing sites. Each applicant for an antenna and or tower shall provide to the community development department an inventory of its existing towers that are either within the jurisdiction of the city or within one-quarter mile of the border thereof, including specific information about the location, height, and design of each tower. The community development department may share such information with other applicants applying for special exception approval under this article or other organizations seeking to locate antennas within the jurisdiction of the city, provided, however, that the community development department is not, by sharing such information, in any way representing or warranting that such sites are available or suitable. 
                  (d)  Aesthetics; lighting. The guidelines set forth in this subsection (d) shall govern the location of all towers, and the installation of all antennas, governed by this article; provided, however, that the planning commission may waive these requirements if it determines that the goals of this article are better served thereby. 
                  (1)  Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, are painted a neutral color, so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness. 
                  (2)  At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and built environment. 
                  (3)  If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible. 
                  (4)  Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the planning commission may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views. 
                  (e)  Federal requirements. All towers must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed, then the owners of the towers and antennas governed by this article shall bring such towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six months of the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a more stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal agency. Failure to bring towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at the owner's expense. Any such removal by the city shall be in the manner provided in O.C.G.A. §§ 41-2-8—41-2-17. 
                  (f)  Building codes; safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity of towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes and the applicable standards for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries Association, as amended from time to time. If, upon inspection, the planning commission concludes that a tower fails to comply with such codes and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to the owner of the tower, the owner shall have 30 days to bring such tower into compliance with such codes and standards. If the owner fails to bring such tower into compliance within said 30 days, the city may remove such tower at the owner's expense. Any such removal by the city shall be in the manner provided in O.C.G.A. §§ 41-2-8—41-2-17.

                  (a)  Generally. 
                  (1)  The planning commission may approve the locations of antennas and towers in any other zoning district of the city. 
                  (2)  Each applicant for special exception approval shall apply to the planning commission, providing the information set forth in section 14-235(b) and (d). Application shall be received at least 20 days prior to the planning commission meeting. The hearing notice shall be advertised in the approved legal gazette and posted on the property 15 days prior to the planning commission meeting. A fee in the amount established by ordinance is to accompany the application. 
                  (3)  The planning commission shall respond to each such application within 45 days after receiving it by either approving or denying the application. If the planning commission fails to respond to the applicant within said 45 days, then the application, shall be deemed to be approved. 
                  (4)  If special exception approval is denied the applicant may appeal said denial to the city council upon written notice. Notice of appeal must be made within ten days of denial of the request. 
                  (b)  Special exception approved uses. The following uses, may be approved by the planning commission after conducting a public hearing: 
                  (1)  Installing an antenna on an existing structure other than a tower, such as a building, sign, light pole, water tower, or other freestanding nonresidential structure, that is less than 50 in height, so long as such addition does not add more than 20 feet to the height of the existing structure; 
                  (2)  Installing an antenna on an existing tower of any height, including a preexisting tower and further including the placement of additional buildings or other supporting equipment used in connection with said antenna, so long as the addition of said antenna adds no more than 20 feet to the height of said existing tower; 
                  (3)  Locating any alternative tower structure in a zoning district other than industrial or agricultural that in the judgment of the planning and zoning commission is in conformity with the goals set forth in section 14-232(a); 
                  (4)  Locating any tower in a zoning district other than industrial or agricultural, provided a licensed professional engineer certifies the tower can structurally accommodate the number of shared users proposed by the applicant; the planning commission concludes the tower is in conformity with the goals set forth in section 14-232(a) and the requirements of section 14-232(d), (e), and (f); the tower is to be set back from any existing off-site residence a distance equal to the height of the tower; and the tower meets the following height and usage criteria: 
                  a.  For a single user, up to 90 feet in height; 
                  b.  For two users, up to 120 feet in height; and 
                  c.  For three or more users, up to 150 feet in height. 
                  (Code 1986, § 5-255; Ord. No. O-99-08-35, § 4, 8-19-1999) 
                  Sec. 14-235. - Special exception permits. 
                  (a)  Generally. The following provisions shall govern the issuance of special exception permits: 
                  (1)  If the tower or antenna is not a permitted use under section 14-233, then a special exception permit shall be required for the construction of a tower or the placement of an antenna in all zoning districts. 
                  (2)  In granting a special exception permit, the planning commission may impose conditions to the extent that they conclude such conditions are necessary to minimize any adverse effect of the proposed tower on adjoining properties. 
                  (3)  Any information of an engineering nature that the applicant submits, whether civil, mechanical, or electrical shall be certified by a licensed professional engineer. 
                  (b)  Information required. Each applicant requesting a special exception permit under this article shall submit a scaled site plan and a scaled elevation view and other supporting drawings, calculations, and other documentation, signed and sealed by appropriate licensed professional engineers, showing the location and dimensions of all improvements, including information concerning topography, radio frequency coverage, tower height requirements, setbacks, drives, parking, fencing, landscaping, adjacent uses, and other information deemed by the planning commission to be necessary to assess compliance with this article. 
                  (c)  Factors considered in granting special exception permits. The planning commission shall consider the following factors in determining whether to issue a special exception permit, although they may waive or reduce the burden on the applicant of one or more of these criteria, if they conclude that the goals of this article are better served thereby: 
                  (1)  Height of the proposed tower; 
                  (2)  Proximity of the tower to residential structures and residential district boundaries; 
                  (3)  Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties; 
                  (4)  Surrounding topography; 
                  (5)  Surrounding tree coverage and foliage; 
                  (6)  Design of the tower, with particular reference to design characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual obtrusiveness; 
                  (7)  Proposed ingress and egress; and 
                  (8)  Availability of suitable existing towers and other structures as discussed in subsection (d) of this section. 
                  (d)  Availability of suitable existing towers or other structures. No new tower shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the planning commission that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna may consist of any of the following: 
                  (1)  No existing towers or structures are located within the geographic area required to meet applicant's engineering requirements. 
                  (2)  Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to meet applicant's engineering requirements. 
                  (3)  Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment. 
                  (4)  The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the existing towers or structures, or the antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the applicant's proposed antenna. 
                  (5)  The fees, costs, or contractual provisions required by the owner in order to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower or structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development are presumed to be unreasonable. 
                  (6)  The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render existing towers and structures unsuitable. 
                  (e)  Setback and separation requirements. The following setback and separation requirements shall apply to all towers and antennas for which a special exception permit is required; provided, however, that the planning commission may reduce the standard setback and separation requirements if the goals of this article would be better served thereby: 
                  (1)  Towers must be set back a distance equal to the height of the tower from any off-site residential structure. 
                  (2)  Towers, guys, and accessory facilities must satisfy the minimum zoning district setback requirements. 
                  (3)  In zoning districts other than industrial or agricultural zoning districts, towers over 90 feet in height shall not be located within one-quarter of a mile from any existing tower that is over 90 feet in height. 
                  (f)  Security fencing. Towers shall be enclosed by security fencing not less than six feet in height and shall also be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device; provided, however, that the city may waive such requirements, as it deems appropriate. 
                  (g)  Landscaping. The following requirements shall govern the landscaping surrounding towers for which a special exception permit is required; provided, however, that the planning commission may waive such requirements if the goals of this article would be better served thereby: 
                  (1)  Tower facilities shall be landscaped with a buffer of plant materials that effectively screens the view of the tower compound from adjacent residential property. The standard buffer shall comply with buffer requirements as noted in section 94-194(a)(2). 
                  (2)  In locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, the landscaping requirement may be reduced or waived altogether. 
                  (3)  Existing mature tree growth and natural land forms on the site shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. In some cases, such as towers sited on large, wooded lots, natural growth around the property perimeter may be a sufficient buffer. 
                  (Code 1986, § 5-256; Ord. No. O-99-08-35, § 6, 8-19-1999) 
                  Sec. 14-236. - Removal of abandoned antennas and towers. 
                  Any antenna or tower that is not operated for a continuous period of 12 months shall be considered abandoned, and the owner of such antenna or tower shall remove same within 90 days of receipt of notice from the city notifying the owner of such abandonment. If such antenna or tower is not removed within said 90 days, the city may, in the manner provided in O.C.G.A. §§ 41-2-8—41-2-17, remove such antenna or tower at the owner's expense. If there are two or more users of a single tower, then this provision shall not become effective until all users cease using the tower.

                  (a)  Where a person or entity which desires to construct a telecommunications antenna or tower pursuant to this article can show that a provision of this article would cause unnecessary hardship if strictly adhered to, or where, because of conditions peculiar to the site, or other unusual circumstances beyond the control of such person or entity, in the opinion of the planning commission, a departure from strict adherence to this article may be made without violating the intent of this article, the planning commission may, in its sole discretion, authorize a variance. Any such variance request shall be submitted in writing to the planning commission, and the minutes of the planning commission shall reflect the action taken by the planning commission as to such variance request, and such minutes shall also include the reason or reasons for granting such variance request. 
                  (b)  With respect to the variance request authorized in subsection (a) of this section, the right to submit such a variance request shall be waived unless the request is submitted to the planning commission at the time the antenna permit is requested, or at the time the request for a special exception pursuant to section 14-234 is submitted. 
                  (c)  The decision of the planning commission as to the approval or disapproval of variances requested under this article shall be final and not subject to appeal.

                  Sec. 14-272. - Certificate of appropriateness. 
                  (a)  Approval of alterations or new construction in historic districts or involving historic properties or landmarks. After designation by ordinance of a historic property or landmark or of a historic district, no material change in the appearance of such historic property or landmark, or of a structure, site, object or work of art within such historic district, shall be made or be permitted to be made by the owner or occupant thereof, unless or until the application for a certificate of appropriateness has been submitted to and approved by the commission. In the event that a material change in the appearance of such historic property or landmark, or a material change in the appearance of as structure, site, object, or work of art within such historic district is undertaken without obtaining a certificate of appropriateness from the commission, the commission may direct the city building inspector, or his designee, to issue a stop work order, and all such work shall cease. No person, firm or corporation shall undertake any work on such project so along as such stop work order shall continue in effect. The owner of the subject property shall submit an application for a certificate of appropriateness within seven days of the issuance of a stop work order. At the next regular meeting of the commission, the commission shall review such application without prejudice as if no work had been undertaken or completed. 
                  (b)  Approval of new construction within designated districts. The commission shall issue certificates of appropriateness to new structures constructed within designated historic districts if these structures conform in design, scale, building materials, setback and landscaping to the character of the district specified in the design criteria developed by the commission. 
                  (c)  Guidelines and criteria for certificates of appropriateness. The commission shall issue certificates of appropriateness to existing buildings. The secretary of the interior's "Standards for Historic Preservation Projects" including the secretary's "Standards for Rehabilitation" shall be used as a guideline along with any other criteria adopted by the commission. 
                  (d)  Submission of plans to commission. An application for a certificate of appropriateness shall be accompanied by such drawings, photographs, plans or other documentation as may be required by the commission. Applications involving demolition or relocation shall be accompanied by post-demolition or relocation plans for the site. 
                  (e)  Acceptable commission reaction to applications. 
                  (1)  The commission shall approve the application and issue a certificate of appropriateness if it finds that the proposed material changes in the appearance would not have a substantial adverse effect on the aesthetic, historic, or architectural significance and value of the historic property or landmark or the historic district. In making this determination, the commission shall consider, in addition to any other pertinent factors, the historical and architectural value and significance, architectural style, general design arrangement, texture and material of the architectural features involved, and the relationship thereof to the exterior architectural style, and pertinent features of the other structures in the immediate neighborhood. 
                  (2)  The commission shall deny a certificate of appropriateness if it finds that the proposed material changes in appearance would have substantial adverse effects on the aesthetic, historic or architectural significance and value of the historic property or the historic district. 
                  (f)  Public hearings, notices and right to be heard. At least seven days prior to review of a certificate of appropriateness, the commission shall take such action as may reasonably be required to inform the owners of any property likely to be affected by reason of the application, and shall give applicant and such owners an opportunity to be heard. In cases where the commission deems it necessary, it may hold a public hearing concerning the application. 
                  (g)  Interior alterations. In its review of applications for certificates of appropriateness, the commission shall not consider interior arrangement or use having no effect on exterior architectural features. 
                  (h)  Technical advice. The commission shall have the power to seek technical advice from outside its members on any application. 
                  (i)  Deadline for approval or rejection of application. 
                  (1)  The commission shall approve or reject an application for a certificate of appropriateness within 45 days after the filing thereof by the owner or occupant on an historic property, or landmark, or of a structure, site, object, or work of art located within a historic district. Evidence of approval shall be by a certificate of appropriateness issued by the commission. Notice of the issuance or denial of a certificate of appropriateness shall be sent by United States mail to the applicant and all other persons who have requested such notice in writing filed with the commission. 
                  (2)  Failure of the commission to act within said 45 days shall constitute approval, and no other evidence of approval shall be needed. 
                  (j)  Necessary actions to be taken by commission upon rejection. 
                  (1)  In the event the commission rejects an application, it shall state its reasons for doing so, and shall transmit a record of such actions and reasons, in writing to the applicant. The commission may suggest alternate courses of action it thinks proper if it disapproves of the application submitted. The applicant, if the applicant so desires, may make modifications to the plans and may resubmit the application at any time after doing so. 
                  (2)  In cases where the application covers a material change in the appearance of a structure which would require the issuance of a building permit, the rejection of the application for a certificate of appropriateness by the commission shall be binding upon the building official or other administrative officer charged with issuing building permits and, in such cases, no building permit shall be issued. 
                  (k)  Undue hardship. Where, by reason of unusual circumstances, the strict application of any provision of this article would result in the exceptional practical difficulty or undue hardship upon any owner of a specific property or landmark, the commission, in passing upon applications, shall have the power to vary or modify strict adherence to said provisions, or to interpret the meaning of said provisions, so as to relieve such difficulty or hardship; provided such variances, modifications or interpretations shall remain in harmony with the general purpose and intent of said provisions, so that the architectural or historical integrity or character of the property shall be conserved and substantial justice done. In granting variances, the commission may impose such reasonable and additional stipulations and conditions as will, in its judgment, best fulfill the purpose of this article. An undue hardship shall not be a situation of the person's own making. 
                  (l)  Requirement of conformance. 
                  (1)  A certificate of appropriateness shall be limited to those elements presented to and approved by the commission. Approval of other elements, whether related or unrelated to the project presented shall not be implied by the issuance of the certificate of appropriateness. All work performed pursuant to an issued certificate of appropriateness shall conform to the requirements of such certificate. In the event work is performed not in accordance with such certificate, the commission shall issue a cease and desist order and all work shall cease. 
                  (2)  The city council or the commission shall be authorized to institute any appropriate action or proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent any material change in appearance of a designated historic property or landmark or historic district, except those changes made in compliance with the provision of this article or to prevent any illegal act or conduct with respect to such historic property or landmark or historic district. 
                  (3)  After issuance of a certificate of appropriateness, changes in the work or changes to approve a plan must be submitted to and approved by the commission prior to beginning work on any aspect of such changes. Any such amendment or modification to the original plan must be submitted to the commission and approved by the commission in the same manner as an original certificate of appropriateness application is considered. 
                  (m)  Certificate to become void if construction not commenced. A certificate of appropriateness shall become void unless construction is commenced within six months of date of issuance. Certificates of appropriateness shall be issued for a period of 18 months and are renewable. A renewal for a period of up to six months may be obtained upon submission of a written request by the applicant and issuance of a written approval of such renewal by the commission. 
                  (n)  Recording of applications. The commission shall keep a public record of all applications for certificates of appropriateness, and of all the commission's proceedings in connection with said application. 
                  (o)  Acquisition of property. The commission may, where such action is authorized by the city council and is reasonably necessary or appropriate for the preservation of a unique historic property or landmark, enter into negotiations with the owner for the acquisition by gift, purchase, exchange, or otherwise, to the property or any interest therein. 
                  (p)  Appeals. Any person who has submitted an application for a certificate of appropriateness that has been denied by the commission may appeal such denial to the city council. Any such appeal must be filed with the city council within 15 days after the notice of denial of the application for the certificate of appropriateness is mailed to the applicant. The city council may approve, modify, or reject the determination made by the commission, but may only modify or reject the determination if the city council finds that the commission abused its discretion in reaching its decision denying the application. Appeals from the decision of the city council on the appeal may be taken to the superior court of the county in the manner provided by law for appeals from convictions for violations of the ordinances of the city.

Ordinary maintenance or repair of any exterior architectural or environmental feature in or on a historic property or landmark to correct deterioration, decay, or damage, or to sustain the existing form, and that does not involve a material change in design, material or other appearance thereof, does not require a certificate of appropriateness. 
                  (b)  Failure to provide ordinary maintenance and repair. Property owners of historic properties or landmarks or properties within historic districts shall not allow their buildings to deteriorate by failing to provide ordinary maintenance or repair. The commission shall be charged with the following responsibilities regarding deterioration by neglect: 
                  (1)  The commission shall monitor the condition of historic properties, landmarks, and existing buildings in historic districts to determine if they are being allowed to deteriorate by neglect. Such conditions as broken windows, doors and openings that allow the elements and vermin to enter, the deterioration of exterior architectural features, or the deterioration of a building's structural system shall constitute failure to provide ordinary maintenance or repair. 
                  (2)  In the event the commission determines a failure to provide ordinary maintenance or repair, the commission will notify the owner of the property and set forth the steps that need to be taken to remedy the situation. The owner of such property will have 30 days in which to do this. 
                  (3)  In the event that the condition is not remedied in 30 days, the owner shall be punished as provided in section 1-8 and, at the direction of the city council, the commission may perform or cause to be performed such maintenance or repair as is necessary to prevent deterioration by neglect. The owner of the property shall be liable for the cost of such maintenance and repair performed by the commission. 
                  (c)  Affirmation of existing building and zoning codes. 
                  (1)  Nothing in this article shall be construed as to exempt property owners from complying with existing city or county building and zoning codes, nor to prevent any property owner from making any use of such owner's property not prohibited by other statutes, ordinances, or regulations. 
                  (2)  Nothing in this article shall be construed so as to prevent any utility company from trimming trees or keeping the rights-of-way in accordance with existing franchise agreements between the utilities and the city.

                  At the time of filing an application for a certificate of appropriateness, which requires a public hearing pursuant to this chapter, the applicant shall pay to the finance director a filing fee in the amount established by ordinance. Said fee is to be used to defray the cost to the city of processing the application and providing the required notices to the public and other interested parties of hearings and other matters with respect to the application.

                  In addition to the authority provided to the city council and the historic preservation commission in subsection 14-272(l)(2), a violation of any of the provisions of this article shall be punished as provided in section 1-8.

                  Sec. 14-301. - Purpose. 
                  (a)  The existence of real property which is maintained in a blighted condition increases the burden of the state and local government by increasing the need for government services, including but not limited to, social services, public safety services, and code enforcement services. Rehabilitation of blighted property decreases this need for such government services. 
                  (b)  In furtherance of its objective to eradicate conditions of slum and blight within the city, this mayor and council, in exercise of the powers granted to municipal corporations at Chapter 61, Urban Redevelopment, of O.C.G.A. title 36, has designated those areas of the city where conditions of slum and blight are found or are likely to spread. 
                  (c)  In recognition of the need for enhanced governmental services and in order to encourage private property owners to maintain their real property and the buildings, structures and improvement thereon in good condition and repair, and as an incentive to encourage community redevelopment, a community redevelopment tax incentive program is hereby established as authorized by Article IX, Section II, Paragraph VII(d) of the 1983 Constitution of the State of Georgia.

                  (a)  In order for a parcel of real property to be officially designated as maintained in a blighted condition and subject to increased taxation, the following steps must be completed: 
                  (1)  An inspection must be performed on the parcel of property. In order for an inspection to be performed: 
                  a.  A request may be made by the public officer or by at least five residents of the city for inspection of a parcel of property, said inspection to be based on the criteria as delineated in ordinance; or 
                  b.  The public officer may cause a survey of existing housing conditions to be performed, or may refer to any such survey conducted or finalized within the previous five years, to locate or identify any parcels which may be in a blighted condition and for which a full inspection should be conducted to determine if that parcel of property meets the criteria set out in this article for designation as being maintained in a blighted condition. 
                  (2)  A written inspection report of the findings for any parcel of property inspected pursuant to subsection (1) above shall be prepared and submitted to the public officer. Where feasible, photographs of the conditions found to exist on the property on the date of inspection shall be made and supplement the inspection report. Where compliance with minimum construction, housing, occupancy, fire and life safety codes in effect within the city are in question, the inspection shall be conducted by a certified inspector possessing the requisite qualifications to determine minimal code compliance. 
                  (3)  Following completion of the inspection report, the public officer shall make a determination, in writing, that a property is maintained in a blighted condition, as defined by this article, and is subject to increased taxation. 
                  (4)  The public officer shall cause a written notice of his determination that the real property at issue is being maintained in a blighted condition to be served upon the person(s) shown on the most recent tax digest of Sumter County as responsible for payment of ad valorem taxes assessed thereon; provided, however, where through the existence of reasonable diligence it becomes known to the public officer that real property has been sold or conveyed since publication of the most recent tax digest, written notice shall be given to the person(s) known or reasonably believed to then own the property or be chargeable with the payment of ad valorem taxes thereon, at the best address available. Service in the manner set forth at O.C.G.A. § 41-2-12 shall constitute sufficient notice to the property's owner or person chargeable with the payment of ad valorem taxes for purpose of this section, except that posting of the notice on the property will not be required. 
                  (b)  The written notice given to the person(s) chargeable with the payment of ad valorem taxes shall notify such person of the public officer's determination the real property is being maintained in a blighted condition and shall advise such person of the hours and location at which the person may inspect and copy the public officer's determination and any supporting documentation. Persons notified that real property of which the person(s) is chargeable with the payment of ad valorem taxes shall have 30 days from the receipt of notice in which to request a hearing before the city's municipal court. Written request for hearing shall be filed with the public officer and shall be date stamped upon receipt. Upon receipt of a request for hearing, the public officer shall notify the municipal court and the building inspector or person who performed the inspection and prepared the inspection report. 
                  (c)  Within 30 days of the receipt of a request for hearing, the municipal court shall set a date, time and location for the hearing and shall give at least ten business days' notice to the person(s) requesting the hearing, the public officer and the building inspector or person who performed the inspection and prepared the inspection report. Notice of scheduled hearings shall be published as a legal advertisement in the Americus Times Recorder, or other designated legal organ in Sumter County, at least five days prior to the hearing. Hearings may be continued by the municipal court judge upon request of any party, for good cause. 
                  (d)  At the hearing, the public officer shall have the burden of demonstrating by a preponderance of the evidence that the subject property is maintained in a blighted condition, as defined by this article. The municipal court judge shall cause a record of the evidence submitted at the hearing to be maintained. Upon hearing from the public officer and/or their witnesses and the person(s) requesting the hearing and/or their witnesses, the judge of municipal court shall make a determination either affirming or reversing the determination of the public officer. The determination shall be in writing and copies thereof shall be served on the parties by certified mail or statutory overnight delivery. If the court's determination is that the designation of the property as blighted property should be affirmed, then the court shall include in its order a provision granting the public official the authority to lift the blighted property designation in accord with the procedures established in section 14-305 of this article. The determination by the court shall be deemed final. A copy of such determination shall also be served upon the finance director, who shall include the increased tax on the next regular tax bill rendered on behalf of the city. 
                  (e)  Persons aggrieved by the determination of the court affirming the determination of the public officer may petition the Superior Court of Sumter County for a writ of certiorari within 30 days of issuance of the municipal court's written determination.

                  (1)  Completion of work required under a plan of remedial action or redevelopment approved by the city's planning and development director which addresses the conditions of blight found to exist on or within the property, including compliance with all applicable minimum codes; or 
                  (2)  Completion of work required under a court order entered in a proceeding brought pursuant to article IV, City Derelict Property Ordinance, of this chapter 14 of the Code of Americus, Georgia. 
                  (b)  Before action on a petition to lift the designation, the public officer shall cause the property to be thoroughly inspected by a building inspector who, by written inspection report, shall certify that all requisite work has been performed to applicable code in a workmanlike manner, in accordance with the specifications of the plan of remedial action or redevelopment, or applicable court order. Upon finding required work to be satisfactorily performed, the public officer shall issue a written determination that the real property is no longer maintained in a blighted condition. Copies of this determination shall be served upon the person(s) chargeable with the payment of ad valorem taxes, and upon the finance director. Upon receipt of such notice, the finance director shall provide notice to the appropriate taxing authority that the additional ad valorem tax imposed in accord with subsection 14-303(a) has been terminated. Thereafter, the property shall be taxed for ad valorem taxes as if such property had never been determined to be blighted as defined herein, except with respect to any ad valorem tax reductions that may be applied in accord with section 14-306. 
                  (c)  All plans for remedial action or redevelopment shall be in writing, signed by the person(s) chargeable with the payment of ad valorem taxes on the real property and the director of the city's planning and inspection department, and contain the following: 
                  (1)  The plan shall be consistent with the city's comprehensive plan and all laws and ordinances governing the subject property, and shall conform to any urban redevelopment plan adopted for the area within which the property lies; 
                  (2)  The plan shall set forth in reasonable detail the requirements for repair, closure, demolition or restoration of existing structures, in accordance with minimal state-wide codes; where structures are demolished, the plan shall include provisions for debris removal, stabilization and landscaping of the property; 
                  (3)  On parcels of five acres or greater, the plan shall address the relationship to local objectives respecting land uses, improved traffic, public transportation, public utilities, recreational and community facilities, and other public improvements; 
                  (4)  The plan shall contain verifiable funding sources which will be used to complete its requirements and show the feasibility thereof; 
                  (5)  The plan shall contain a timetable for completion of required work; and 
                  (6)  Any outstanding ad valorem taxes (state, school, county and city, including the increased tax pursuant to this article) and governmental liens due and payable on the property must be satisfied in full.

                  (a)  Real property which has had its designation as maintained in a blighted condition removed by the public officer, as provided in section 14-305, shall be eligible for a decrease in the rate of city ad valorem taxation by applying a factor of 0.5 to the city millage rate applied to the property, so that such property shall be taxed at a lower millage rate than the millage rate generally applied in the municipality or otherwise provided by general law; such decreased rate of taxation shall be applied beginning with the next tax bill rendered following removal of official designation of a real property as blighted. The decreased rate of taxation may be given in successive years, depending on the amount of cost expended by the person(s) chargeable with payment of ad valorem taxes on the property to satisfy its remediation or redevelopment, with every $25,000.00 or portion thereof equaling one year of tax reduction; provided, however, that no property shall be entitled to reduction in city ad valorem taxes for more than four successive years. 
                  (b)  In order to claim entitlement for a decreased rate of taxation, the person(s) chargeable with payment of ad valorem taxes on the property shall submit a notarized affidavit to the public officer, supported by receipts or other evidence of payment, of the amount expended.

                  The term "substantial improvement" includes structures that have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. For the purpose of this definition, substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include those improvements of a building required to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to ensure safe living conditions, which have been pre-identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project. 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions means where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this article that permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article.

                  It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development that may increase flood damage or erosion; 
                  (4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and 
                  (5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers that are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.

                  Sec. 34-35. - General standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure; 
                  (2)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage; 
                  (3)  New construction or substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
                  (4)  Elevated buildings. All new construction or substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater. 
                  a.  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
                  1.  Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
                  2.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and 
                  3.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both direction; 
                  b.  So as not to violate the "lowest floor" criteria of this article, the unfinished or flood resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area; and 
                  c.  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms; 
                  (5)  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components, all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding; 
                  (6)  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces; 
                  (7)  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system; 
                  (8)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters; 
                  (9)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding; and 
                  (10)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure that is not compliant with the provisions of this article, shall be undertaken only if the nonconformity is not furthered, extended or replaced.

                  Sec. 34-36. - Specific standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 34-35(4), elevated buildings. 
                  (2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-30, AE or AH zones, may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in subsection 34-34(b)(6). 
                  (3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
                  a.  All manufactured homes are placed or substantially improved on: 
                  1.  Individual lots or parcels; 
                  2.  In new or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions; 
                  3.  In expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions; or 
                  4.  On a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  b.  Manufactured homes placed or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
                  1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or 
                  2.  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength, of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
                  c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (See subsection 34-35(6).) 
                  d.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
                  1.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use; a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick-disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions. 
                  2.  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for new construction, including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsection (3)a.—c. of this section. 
                  3.  The recreational vehicle must be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days. 
                  (4)  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 34-26, are areas designated as floodways. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
                  b.  Only if subsection (4)a. is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of sections 34-35—34-40. 
                  (Code 1986, § 5-65; Ord. No. O-00-11-47, 11-16-2000; Ord. No. O-09-08-28, 8-20-2009) 
                  Sec. 34-37. - Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations, floodway, A-zones. 
                  Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 34-26, where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A-zones), or where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 34-26, then the building official shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state or other source, in order to administer the provisions of sections 34-35—34-40. Only if data are not available from these sources, then the provisions of subsections (2) and (3) of this section shall apply. 
                  (2)  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 20 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
                  (3)  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement, elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 34-36(4), elevated buildings. 
                  (4)  The building official shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file.

                  Areas of special flood hazard established in section 34-26, may include designated AO shallow flooding areas. These areas have base flood depths of one to three feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. The following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 34-35(4), elevated buildings. 
                  (2)  The building official shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
                  (3)  New construction or the substantial improvement of a nonresidential structure may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to the specified FIRM flood level plus one foot, above highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions of this section, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth in this section and as required in subsections 34-33(c)(3) and (d). 
                  (4)  Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure.

                  Sec. 34-40. - Variance procedures. 
                  (a)  The board, as established by the city, shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this article. 
                  (b)  The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the building official in the enforcement or administration of this article. 
                  (c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the board may appeal such decision as provided in other cases for appeal of said board's decisions. 
                  (d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (g)  In reviewing such requests, the board shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article. 
                  (h)  Conditions for variances: 
                  (1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
                  b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  (2)  The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (4)  The building official shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (i)  Upon consideration of the factors listed in this section and the purposes of this article, the board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

                  Sec. 34-72. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices. 
                  (a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the ordinance and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of this section. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit. 
                  (b)  Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
                  (1)  Best management practices as set forth in subsections (b) and (c) of this section shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with subsection (2) of this section or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
                  (2)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm-water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This subsection shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
                  (5)  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsections (c)(15) and (16) of this section, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
                  (c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et. seq., for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia, published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regarding and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  (7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in runoff water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this subsection, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et. seq.; 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut-face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection (b)(2) of this section; 
                  (15)  Except as provided in subsection (c)(16) of this section, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream; that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the groundwater table year-round; for which groundwater is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow, Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this subsection. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (16)  There is established a 60-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines. 
                  (d)  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et. seq., shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. 
                  (e)  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of, nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit.

                  Sec. 34-73. - Application/permit process. 
                  (a)  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
                  (b)  Application requirements. 
                  (1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the City of Americus without first obtaining a permit from the building official or designee to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
                  (2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the building official and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection (c) of this section. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land-disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of subsections 34-72(b) and (c) of this article will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by five copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-10. 
                  (3)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(5)(a), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a), half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. §§ 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  (4)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by subsections 34-72(c)(15) and (16) has been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per subsection (b)(6) of this section, have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
                  (5)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this article section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
                  (6)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  (c)  Plan requirements. 
                  (1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in subsections 34-72(b) and (c) of this article, or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this article. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and stormwater management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land-disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
                  (2)  Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
                  (d)  Permits. 
                  (1)  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
                  (2)  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this article, any variances required by subsections 34-72(c)(15) and (16) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per subsection (b)(6) of this section are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
                  (3)  Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this article, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
                  (4)  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
                  (5)  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this article. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
                  (6)  The LIA may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(f)(1).

                  (a)  The building official or designee will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article. 
                  (b)  The local issuing authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within 12 months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975. 
                  (c)  The building official or designee shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this article, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities. 
                  (d)  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
                  (e)  The districts or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). The district or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
                  (f)  The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within 90 days after notification by the division, the division shall revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority.

                  It shall be unlawful as a normal practice for any person, firm, or city department to top any street tree, park tree, or other tree on public property. The term "topping" is defined as the severe cutting back of limbs to stubs larger than three inches in diameter within the tree's crown to such a degree so as to remove the normal canopy and disfigure the tree. Trees severely damaged by storms or other causes, or certain trees under utility wires or other obstructions where other pruning practices are impractical may be exempted from this article at the determination of the city. Pruning allowed pursuant to the time of any franchise agreement between the city and a public utility shall continue to be authorized in accord with the terms of such franchise agreement.

                  ARTICLE V. - WETLAND PROTECTION 

                  Sec. 34-130. - Definitions. 
                  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Generalized wetland map means a map showing the general locations of wetlands within the county and the city. The generalized wetland map used at the time this article is adopted is the National Wetlands Inventory as published by the United States Department of Interior. 
                  Hydric soils means soils that form as a result of saturated soils conditions. A list of these soils is maintained by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service (formerly the Soil Conservation Service). 
                  Hydrophytic vegetation means macrophytic plants tolerant of or dependent on saturated soil conditions. 
                  Jurisdictional determination means an official statement or map signed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, stating whether a certain specified site is a wetland or is in a wetland. 
                  Jurisdictional wetland means a wetland area that meets the definitional requirements for wetlands as determined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
                  Temporary emergency permit means a temporary permit that may be issued in certain circumstances specified in subsection 34-133(c). 
                  Wetland means an area that is inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency and distribution sufficient to support, and under normal circumstances does support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions, commonly known as hydrophytic vegetation. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas. 
                  Wetland delineation means the establishment of wetland boundaries by a representative of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers or an authority designated by the corps. 
                  Wetland protection district means all wetlands within the city and shown on the generalized wetland map. 
                  (Code 1986, § 5-279; Ord. No. O-99-10-40, § 9, 10-21-1999) 
                  Sec. 34-131. - Findings and purpose. 
                  (a)  Findings of fact. Wetlands are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control, erosion control; natural resource education, scientific study; and open space and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well-being of many communities within the state. 
                  (b)  Necessity to protect. Nationally, a considerable number of wetland resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution and other acts. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare. It is, therefore, necessary to discourage development activities that may adversely affect wetlands by ensuring maximum protection for wetlands located in the corporate limits of the city. 
                  (c)  Purpose. The purpose of this article is to promote wetland protection, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational and aesthetic values. Activities that may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practicable as determined through a permitting process. The objective of this article is to protect wetlands from alterations that will significantly affect or reduce their primary functions for water quality, floodplain and erosion control, groundwater recharge, aesthetic nature and wildlife habitat. 
                  (Code 1986, § 5-271; Ord. No. O-99-10-40, § 1, 10-21-1999) 
                  Sec. 34-132. - Districts and boundaries. 
                  (a)  This article shall apply to all lands within wetlands located in the corporate limits of the city. The generalized wetland map, adopted as part of this article, shows the general location of wetlands and should be consulted by persons contemplating activities in or near wetlands. The generalized wetland map, together with all explanatory matter thereon and attached thereto, is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be part of this article. The generalized wetland map shall be on file in the office of building risk management. 
                  (b)  The generalized wetland map is a general reference document, and wetland boundaries indicated on the map are approximations. The purpose of the generalized wetland map is to alert developers/landowners that a subject site may be in a jurisdictional wetland or in proximity to a jurisdictional wetland, requiring the developer/landowner to seek U.S. Army Corps of Engineers guidance as to whether a section 404 permit will be required prior to initiation of any development activity on the subject site. The generalized wetland map does not represent precise boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the county and the city, and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this article does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements. 
                  (Code 1986, § 5-272; Ord. No. O-99-10-40, § 2, 10-21-1999) 
                  Sec. 34-133. - Local development permits. 
                  (a)  Required. No regulated activity will be allowed within the wetland protection district without written permission from the permitting officer in the form of a local development permit. Issuance of a local development permit is contingent on full compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable regulations. All activities that are not identified in subsection (b) of this section or by other local development ordinances, shall be prohibited without prior issuance of a local development permit. If the area proposed for development appears to be located within 50 feet of the wetland protection district boundary, as determined by the permitting officer from review of the generalized wetland map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required. If the corps determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site and that a section 404 permit or letter of permission is required, a local development permit will be issued only following receipt by the local permitting officer of a copy of the section 404 permit or letter of permission issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
                  (b)  Permissible uses; uses as of right. The following uses shall be allowed as of right within a wetland to the extent they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law, including laws of trespass, and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining or dredging except as provided herein: 
                  (1)  Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish and other wildlife, provided they do not affect waters of the state or of the United States in such a way that would require an individual section 404 permit. 
                  (2)  Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, birdwatching, hiking, boating, horseback riding and canoeing. 
                  (3)  Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the state forestry commission and as specified in section 404 of the Clean Water Act. 
                  (4)  The continued cultivation of agricultural crops. Agricultural activities shall, however, be subject to best management practices approved by the state department of agriculture. 
                  (5)  The pasturing of livestock, provided that riparian wetlands are protected, that soil profiles are not disturbed and that approved agricultural best management practices are followed. 
                  (6)  Education, scientific research and nature trails. 
                  (c)  Temporary emergency permit. A temporary, emergency permit can be issued by the permitting officer for the following reasons: 
                  (1)  Maintenance or repair of lawfully located roads or structures and of facilities used in the service of the public to provide transportation, electric, gas, water, telephone, telegraph, telecommunication or other services, provided that such roads, structures or facilities are not materially changed or enlarged, and written notice prior to the commencement of work has been given to the permitting officer, and provided that the work is conducted using best management practices to ensure that flow and circulation patterns and chemical and biological characteristics of the wetland are not impaired, and that any adverse affect on the aquatic environment will be minimized. 
                  (2)  Temporary water level stabilization measures associated with ongoing silvicultural operations. 
                  (3)  Limited ditching, tilling, dredging, excavating or filling done solely for the purpose of maintaining or repairing existing drainage systems necessary for the cultivation of agricultural crops, provided the maintenance or repair activity does not result in the impairment, alteration or loss of wetlands not previously subject to agricultural and silvicultural use under the terms and provisions of subsection (b)(4) of this section. 
                  (4)  Limited excavating and filling necessary for the repair and maintenance of piers, walkways, nature trails, observation decks, wildlife management shelters, boathouses or other similar water-related structures, provided such facilities and structures are built on pilings to allow unobstructed flow of water and preserve the natural contour of the wetland. 
                  (d)  Site plans. Applications for a local development permit within the generalized wetland protection district shall include a site plan, drawn to a scale of not less than one inch equals 100 feet. 
                  (1)  A map of all planned excavation and fill, including calculations of the volume of cut and fill involved with cross sectional drawings showing existing and proposed grades. Elevations, horizontal scale and vertical scale must be shown on the cross sectional drawings. 
                  (2)  A map of any wetland boundaries occurring within the site must be provided. This boundary may be included on other maps provided by the applicant. 
                  (3)  Location, dimensions and area of all impervious surfaces, both existing and proposed, on the site and adjacent to the site for a distance of 200 feet. 
                  (4)  The orientation and distance from the boundaries of the subject site to the nearest bank of an affected perennial stream or water body. 
                  (5)  Elevation of the site and adjacent lands within 200 feet of the site at contour intervals of no greater than two feet; and no greater than one foot for slopes less than or equal to two percent. 
                  (6)  Location and detailed design of any spill and leak collection systems designed for the purpose of containing hazardous or toxic materials released accidently. 
                  (7)  All proposed temporary disruptions or diversions of local hydrology. 
                  (e)  Activities to comply with site plan. All development activities or site work conducted after approval of the site plan shall conform with the specifications of said site plan. The site plan may be amended only with approval of the permitting officer. The permitting officer may require additional information deemed necessary to verify compliance with the provisions of this article or to evaluate the proposed use in terms of the purposes of this article. 
                  (f)  Subdivision approval in the wetland protection district. Any application for subdivision approval shall include a jurisdictional determination approved by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. If the corps determines that wetlands are present and that a section 404 permit or letter of permission is required, subdivision approval will be issued only following issuance of the section 404 permit or letter of permission. 
                  (g)  Subdivision design options in the wetland protection district. Any subdivision that includes jurisdictional wetlands shall be allowed and encouraged to use the following options: 
                  (1)  Lot size averaging. Lot size averaging is encouraged in single-family detached subdivisions as a means to work around wetland areas. The planning commission may allow a reduction in lot size provided the same number of lots in the same subdivision are oversized by an equal or greater area. The maximum permissible reduction shall not exceed 25 percent of the minimum required lot area. The number of lots with areas reduced shall not exceed 25 percent of the total number of lots in the subdivision. The permitting officer shall allow no more than a 25 percent adjustment of rear, side and front setbacks for each affected lot. 
                  (2)  Cluster development. Clustering of residential development is encouraged. When considering subdivision approval, the planning commission may allow incorporation of wetland or other significant natural areas as open space in the subdivision plan. Such plans should designate at least 25 percent of the gross land area as open space. Density shall be calculated by subtracting from the total acreage of a parcel all land dedicated or in use for private or public roads, including all vehicular rights-of-way. The resultant acreage will then be divided by the minimum allowed lot size of the district to derive the number of lots permissible. 
                  (h)  Filing fee. At the time of the application, the applicant shall pay a filing fee specified by the permitting officer. Filing fees in the amount established by ordinance shall be required to evaluate the application. However, if after review of the initial application it is determined that expert consultants are necessary to provide services pertaining to functional assessment, mitigation and wetland boundary determination, those fees will be in excess of the filing fee. 
                  (i)  Enforcement authority. The permitting officer is the department, office or individual assigned the responsibility of administering this article. At the time this article is adopted, the administrative authority is vested in the office of building risk management. 
                  (j)  Review procedures. The application shall be made to the permitting officer and will be reviewed within seven days. The review period shall begin upon the permitting officer's determination that the application submitted is complete. The review period shall include the preparation of findings; approval, conditional approval or disapproval, by the permitting officer. The applicant will receive written notification of the findings of the permitting officer. If outside consultants are required, the process will be completed in a timely fashion, but may exceed the seven day review period established herein. 
                  (k)  Appeals. Decisions on permit applications made by the permitting officer may be appealed to the board. The appeal must be submitted in writing with fee attached in the amount established by ordinance to the community development director within ten days of the decision rendered by the permitting officer. A public hearing shall be held by the board. Public announcement of the hearing shall be printed in a local newspaper of general circulation at least 15 days but not more than 45 days prior to the hearing. Any person may offer testimony at the hearing. The decision of the board shall be final and may be issued up to 15 days following the public hearing. 
                  (l)  Permit expiration. 
                  (1)  If construction described in the development permit has not commenced within six months from the date of issuance, the permit shall expire. 
                  (2)  If construction described in the development permit is suspended or abandoned after work has commenced, the permit shall expire six months after the date work ceased. 
                  (3)  Written notice of the pending expiration of the development permit may be issued by the permitting officer, but no such notification is required. 
                  (Code 1986, § 5-273; Ord. No. O-99-10-40, § 3, 10-21-1999) 
                  Sec. 34-134. - Monitoring and enforcement. 
                  (a)  The permitting officer shall have authority to enter upon privately owned land for the purpose of performing duties required under this article, and may take or cause to be made such examination, survey or sampling as the permitting officer deems necessary. 
                  (1)  The permitting officer shall have authority to enter the subject site to monitor development and to enforce this article; issue permits hereunder, and address violations or threatened violations hereof by issuance of violation notices, administrative orders and civil and criminal actions. All costs, fees and expenses in connection with such actions may be recovered as damages against the violator. 
                  (2)  Law enforcement officials or other officials having police powers in the jurisdiction shall have authority to assist the permitting officer with enforcement. 
                  (3)  The permitting officer shall have authority to issue cease and desist orders in the event of any violation of this article. Cease and desist orders may be appealed to a court of competent jurisdiction, as identified herein. 
                  (b)  The permitting officer may require a bond with surety and conditions sufficient to secure compliance with the conditions set forth in the permit. The particular amount and the conditions of the bond shall be consistent with the purposes of this article. In the event of a breach of any condition of any such bond, the permitting officer may institute an action in a court of competent jurisdiction upon such bond and prosecute the same to judgment and execution. 
                  (c)  When the permitting officer determines a building or other structure has been constructed in violation of this article, the violator may, at the discretion of the permitting officer, be required to remove the structure. 
                  (d)  When removal of vegetative cover, excavation or fill has taken place in violation of this article, the violator may, at the discretion of the permitting officer and as far as practicable, be required to restore the affected land to its original contours and to restore vegetation. 
                  (e)  If the permitting officer discovers a violation of this article that also constitutes a violation of any provision of the Clean Water Act as amended, the permitting officer shall issue written notification of the violation to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the landowner. 
                  (f)  Suspension, revocation. The permitting officer may suspend or revoke a permit if he finds the applicant has not complied with the conditions or limitations set forth in the permit or has exceeded the scope of the work set forth in the permit. The permitting officer shall cause notice of denial, issuance, conditional issuance, revocation or suspension of a permit to be published in a daily newspaper having a broad circulation in the areas where the wetland is located.

                  ARTICLE VI. - GROUNDWATER RECHARGE AREA PROTECTION 

                  Sec. 34-154. - Definitions. 
                  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Aquifer means any stratum (rock layer) or zone of rock beneath the surface of the earth capable of containing or producing water from a well. 
                  Groundwater recharge area or aquifer recharge area means an area of the earth's surface where water infiltrates the ground, thereby replenishing the groundwater supplies within an aquifer. 
                  Pollution susceptibility means the relative vulnerability of groundwater to pollution from chemical spills, leaching of pollutants from dump sites, animal waste from agricultural operations or pollution generated by other human activities. 
                  Pollution susceptibility maps means the maps prepared by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources (DNR) that show the relative susceptibility of groundwater to pollution. Pollution susceptibility maps categorize the land areas of the state into areas of high, medium and low groundwater pollution potential. 
                  Significant groundwater recharge areas means areas mapped by DNR in the Hydrologic Atlas 18, 1989 edition. Mapping of recharge areas is based on outcrop area, lithology (chemical nature and form of rock), soil type and thickness, slope, density of lithologic contacts, geologic structure, presence of karst topography (sinkholes, caves and fissures associated with limestone and other carbonate rocks) and potentiometric surfaces. 
                  (Code 1986, § 5-341; Ord. No. O-00-01-02, § 11, 1-20-2000; Ord. No. O-00-06-24, § 11, 6-22-2000) 
                  Sec. 34-155. - Findings and objectives. 
                  (a)  Findings of fact. In order to provide for the health, safety and welfare of the public and to promote a healthy economic climate in the city and surrounding communities, it is essential that public drinking water resources of high quality be ensured. For this reason, it is necessary to protect the subsurface water resources the city and surrounding communities rely on as sources of public water. 
                  (b)  Necessity to manage. Groundwater resources are contained within aquifers, which are permeable, rock strata occupying vast regions of the subsurface. These aquifers are replenished by infiltration of surface water runoff in zones of the surface known as groundwater recharge areas. Groundwater is susceptible to contamination when unrestricted development occurs within significant groundwater recharge areas. It is, therefore, necessary to manage land use within groundwater recharge areas to ensure that pollution threats to water resources are minimized. 
                  (c)  Objectives. The objectives of this article are to: 
                  (1)  Protect groundwater quality by restricting land uses that generate, use, or store dangerous pollutants in recharge areas; 
                  (2)  Protect groundwater quality by limiting density of development; and 
                  (3)  Protect groundwater quality by ensuring that any development that occurs within the recharge area shall have no adverse effect on groundwater quality.

After the making of said report as herein provided, unless specific action is taken by the city council as to said insolvent executions of taxes, it shall be the duty of the finance committee to charge off said insolvent tax executions on what is known as the "insolvent tax docket," which shall be kept by the finance director.

                  (b)  Such procedures may be used for the collection of any and all ad valorem taxes assessed against real property within the city that remain unpaid for a period of 12 months following the date that the taxes initially become delinquent. 
                  (c)  Any proceedings filed in accordance with this section shall be designed solely to enforce the lien for ad valorem taxes against the property subject to taxation, and such proceedings shall not constitute an action for personal liability for such taxes against the owner of the subject property. 
                  (d)  For the purposes of proceedings filed in superior court pursuant to this section, the city tax collector shall be defined as the finance director.

The city attorney shall also provide to the tax collector a legal description of the subject property. 
                  (f)  Nothing contained in this section shall prohibit the city from proceeding to collect delinquent ad valorem taxes in another manner or pursuant to another city ordinance or state statute as the methods for collection of such ad valorem taxes provided in this section are not exclusive, but are merely cumulative of the methods by which the city may collect such taxes pursuant to state law.

                  (c)  Acceptance of delinquent return and remittance without imposing penalty and interest; authority; requirements. If the failure to make any return or to pay the amount of tax by the due date results from providential cause shown to the satisfaction of the governing authority of the city by affidavit attached to the return, and remittance is made within ten days of the due date, such return may be accepted exclusive of penalty and interest.

                  (a)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the city shall be authorized to establish a procedure by which the city can acquire junked motor vehicles, as defined in section 58-47 of the Code, by issuing one-time credits on the city utility bill of the owner of the junked vehicle. Such provisions shall, at a minimum, provide as follows: 
                  (1)  That the city utilities director, or his designee, shall undertake, on a continuing basis, to locate, examine, and inventory all junked vehicles within the city. Such inventory shall be kept and maintained by the utilities director in his office and at such other location or locations as may be directed by the governing body of the city. 
                  (2)  With respect to any junked motor vehicle located upon the premises of a single-family or two-family residence, the utilities director shall determine the ownership of such motor vehicle, and such ownership shall be included in the inventory referred to above. 
                  (3)  The owner of the junked motor vehicle shall be contacted by the utilities director, or his designee, who shall be authorized to purchase the junked motor vehicle from the owner thereof in consideration of a $200.00 credit against the owner's city utility services bill. 
                  (4)  No such credit shall be provided until ownership of the junked motor vehicle is transferred to the city by certificate of title transfer or by bill of sale in the event that the junked motor vehicle is too old to require a certificate of title transfer. Any written transfer of a junked motor vehicle shall include, as part of the terms thereof, authority from the owner of the premises where the junked motor vehicle is located authorizing the city or its designee, to come upon the property where such junked motor vehicle is located and remove the junked motor vehicle by such means as may be deemed necessary by the city or its designee. 
                  (5)  Upon acquisition of the ownership of the junked motor vehicle, the utilities director shall be authorized to sell the junked motor vehicle to a recycling company determined by the utilities director to offer the most advantageous terms (financial and otherwise) to the city with respect to such purchase or purchases. Any sale to a recycling company may be made on a vehicle-by-vehicle basis or with respect to the sale of a group of vehicles. No public bidding shall be required for such sale. 
                  (6)  In the event that the utilities director is required to hire a tow truck company or companies to remove the junked motor vehicles from the premises where they are located, the utilities director shall be authorized to bid out such tow truck services on an annual basis, with the tow truck service being awarded to the lowest responsible bidder or bidders as determined by the utilities director. The utilities director shall also have the authority to terminate any such agreement with a tow truck service at any time due to the failure of the tow truck service to provide such service in a manner acceptable to the city. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the utilities director from awarding such bid to more than one tow truck service at a time and to use such tow truck services on a rotating basis as established by the utilities director if such procedure is determined to be in the best interest of the city. 
                  (b)  The city manager of the city, or her designee, shall be authorized to adopt further rules and regulations to implement and carry out the purposes and intent of this section.

                  Sec. 74-2. - Purpose and findings. 
                  Signs provide an important medium through which individuals may convey a variety of messages. However, left completely unregulated, signs can become a threat to public safety as a traffic hazard and detriment to property values and the city's overall public welfare as an aesthetic nuisance. By enacting this article, the city council intends to: 
                  (1)  Balance the rights of individuals to convey their messages through signs and the right of the public to be protected against the unrestricted proliferation of signs; 
                  (2)  Protect the public health, safety, and welfare; 
                  (3)  Reduce traffic and pedestrian hazards; 
                  (4)  Maintain the historical image of the city; 
                  (5)  Protect property values by minimizing the possible adverse effects and visual blight caused by signs; 
                  (6)  Promote economic development; and 
                  (7)  Ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign regulations.

                  Sec. 74-29. - Nonconforming signs. 
                  (a)  Nonconforming signs, which met all legal requirements when erected, may stay in place, provided that within 120 days of the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, the owner of the nonconforming sign, or his designee, registers the sign with the city. Such registration shall contain the information listed in section 74-50 and shall specify the sign being registered as nonconforming and shall state that the sign was completely installed before the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived. The payment of a fee is not required for the registration of a nonconforming sign. Nonconforming signs shall be permitted until one of the following conditions occur: 
                  (1)  The deterioration of the sign or damage to the sign makes it a hazard or unsightly;

                  (3)  The 120 days has expired from the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived without the sign being registered. 
                  (b)  No structural repairs or change in shape, size or design shall be permitted except to make a nonconforming sign comply with all requirements of this article.

                  Variances shall be limited to the minimum relief necessary to overcome the hardship. No variance shall be granted to allow a greater number of signs than would be allowed if the hardship did not exist. A variance from compliance with the sign regulations of this article shall be limited to the following hardship situations: 
                  (1)  Standards. 
                  a.  Where the proximity of existing signs on adjoining lots causes the subject property to be ineligible due to spacing requirements, for a sign of the type sought; or 
                  b.  Where visibility of a conforming sign from the public street and within 50 feet of the proposed sign would be substantially impaired by existing trees, plants, natural features, signs, buildings, or structures on a different lot; and 
                  c.  Placement of the sign elsewhere on the lot would not remedy the visual obstruction and such visibility obstruction, was not created by the owner of the subject property, and the variance proposed would not create a safety hazard to traffic. 
                  (2)  Applications. Variance applications shall be submitted to the board and shall be heard under the same rules governing appeals. 
                  Administrative variances.

                  (b)  Work on illegal signs. No person shall erect or assist in the erection, construction, maintenance, alteration, relocation, repair or painting of, or do any work upon any sign for which a permit has not been obtained.

                  Sec. 74-51. - Processing procedure. 
                  The city shall process all sign permit applications within 30 business days of the city's actual receipt of a completed application and a sign permit fee. The building risk management office shall notify the applicant of the decision of the city by hand delivery or by mailing a notice to the address on the permit application on or before the 30th business day after the city's receipt of the completed application.

                  Sec. 74-52. - Denial and revocation. 
                  (a)  Procedure. The city shall deny permits to applicants that submit applications for signs that do not comply with the provisions of this chapter, incomplete applications, and applications containing any false material statements. Violation of any provision of this chapter will be grounds for terminating a permit granted by the city for the erection of a sign. Should it be determined that a sign permit was issued pursuant to an incomplete application or an application containing a false material statement, or that a permit has been erroneously issued in violation of this chapter, the building risk management office shall revoke the permit. Should the city deny a permit, the reasons for the denial are to be stated in writing and mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, or via hand delivery to the address on the permit application on or before the 30th business day after the city's receipt of the application. Any application denied and later resubmitted shall be deemed to have been submitted on the date of resubmission, instead of the date of the original submission. No permit shall be denied or revoked, except for due cause as hereinafter defined, and the applicant is granted a public hearing before the board. The applicant will be given ten days' written notice of the time, place, and purpose of the hearing, with a statement of the reason for the denial of the permit application, or the revocation of a permit. The term "due cause" means the violation of the provisions of this chapter, state or federal law related to signage, or the submission of an incomplete application or an application containing false material statements. 
                  (b)  Appeal; final decision by city council. An individual whose permit application has been denied, or a permittee whose permit has been revoked, may appeal the decision to the board to the city council, provided that they file written notice of an appeal with the city clerk within ten business days of the decision. Such appeal shall be considered by the city council at the next city council meeting held after the city's receipt of the written notice of appeal, provided that notice of appeal is received a minimum of two full business days before the meeting. If the appeal is not heard at such meeting, it shall be heard at the next regular meeting of the city council thereafter. The city council shall make a final decision no later than 30 days from the date of the hearing.

                  (e)  Considerations for issuance. The chief of police shall issue a parade permit when, from a consideration of the application and from such other information as may otherwise be obtained, he finds that: 
                  (1)  The conduct of the parade will not substantially interrupt the safe and orderly movement of other traffic contiguous to its route;

                  (a)  In order to comply with the city's liability insurance carrier, the city shall require that all sponsors of special activities or commercial video or film crews carry liability insurance with coverage of at least $1,000,000.00, except for class I; low-hazard activities as defined in subsection (c) of this section. Where liability insurance is required, an activity sponsor shall be required to provide a valid certificate of insurance naming the city as an additional or named insured prior to the activity. The city manager may require higher levels of insurance based upon risk factors and past experience. 
                  (b)  The special activity review committee shall include the city manager, the city clerk, the finance director, and the community development director. The special activity review committee is intended to provide a review of proposed special activities and a risk control guide for the handling of any increased liability on the part of the city associated with special activities. Special activities are defined as activities which are not directly related to the day-to-day operations of the city, but which may occur on premises owned or controlled by the city. The special activity review committee shall make recommendations to the city manager regarding approval of the special activity, liability insurance requirements, and regarding any additional requirements that the committee deems it appropriate to be placed upon any special activity as a condition of the issuance of a permit for such activity. 
                  (c)  It shall be the policy of the city council to not routinely require insurance coverage for activities classified by the special activity review committee as class I; low-hazard. These would be activities that include no physical activity by participants and no substantial exposure to spectators. This waiver of the insurance requirements is meant to cover small gatherings or ceremonies that do not involve more than 50 people, are limited to passive participation by the public, and require no city services. All other activities are required to provide insurance as outlined in this policy. 
                  (d)  In making its recommendations to the city manager regarding each special activity permit, the special activity review committee may recommend additional requirements as a condition of permit issuance. Such additional requirements may include, but shall not necessarily be limited to, specific staffing levels for police, fire, public works, or other personnel in connection with the activity. Expenses incurred by the city in compliance with such requirements shall be billed to and paid by the sponsoring organization. Agreement by the sponsoring organization to pay such additional expenses may be made a condition of the issuance of the permit by the city manager. 
                  (e)  The special activity review committee will review each special activity permit application received and assess the potential liability risk of the city, based upon the following categories: 
                  (1)  Class I; low-hazard activities involve no physical activity by participants and no substantial exposure to spectators. Examples of activities in this category include, but are not limited to, meetings, seminars, social gatherings, theatrical performances, and weddings. 
                  (2)  Class II; moderate-hazard activities involve limited physical activity by participants and no substantial exposure to spectators. Activities in this category include, but are not limited to, downtown celebrations, dances, animal shows, political rallies, and picnics. 
                  (3)  Class III; high-hazard activities major participation and/or moderate exposure to spectators. Activities in this category include, but are not limited to, marathons or running races and circuses or carnivals. 
                  (4)  Class IV; severe-hazard activities involve substantial exposure to participants and/or spectators. Examples of activities in this category include, but are not limited to, rock concerts, vehicle races, and fireworks displays. 
                  (f)  The city manager shall consider the recommendations of the special activity review committee in connection with the approval or disapproval of the proposed special activity. The city manager shall be authorized to accept or reject the recommendations of the committee regarding approval of the proposed permit and regarding the placing of additional requirements, including liability insurance requirements, upon the activity as a condition for the issuance of the permit. The city manager shall also be authorized to place such additional restrictions or requirements as part of the permit as the city manager deems appropriate and in the best interest of the city. The city manager shall also be authorized to require a member or members of the special activity review committee to be available to meet with activity organizers to review any special conditions and to ensure that all such special conditions are met before or during the course of the activity. Some special activities may require that a member of the special activity review committee be on site during the course of the special activity.

                  This division shall be known as the "naming of new streets" division and may be referred to by that title. 
                  (Ord. No. O-07-03-12, § 18-100, 3-22-2007) 
                  Sec. 78-151. - Authority. 
                  The governing body of the city shall have the sole power and authority to name new streets located within the incorporated limits of the city where such streets are owned by the City of Americus. 
                  (Ord. No. O-07-03-12, § 18-101, 3-22-2007) 
                  Sec. 78-152. - Procedures. 
                  With respect to the naming of a new street owned by the city and located within the corporate limits of the City of Americus, the governing body shall be required to follow the following procedures with respect to the naming of such new street: 
                  (1)  By application of a citizen or group of citizens. 
                  a.  A citizen or group of city citizens may submit an application to name a new street hereunder. Such application shall be on forms prescribed by the city clerk. Such application shall not be considered unless at least 75 percent of the persons owning real property abutting such new street submit a written application to the city clerk requesting that such street be named a particular name. 
                  b.  Such application shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable fee of $100.00, which is intended to cover administrative and other costs which are anticipated to be incurred by the city in connection with its consideration of the application. Such application fee shall be deposited into the general fund of the city. 
                  c.  The governing body of the city shall consider such application and act thereon in accord with this division no later than 90 calendar days after the date of submission of such application to the city clerk. In the event that the governing body does not act upon the application prior to the expiration of such 90 calendar day period, then the street shall be automatically renamed as requested in the application. 
                  d.  Upon receipt of the application by the city clerk, the city clerk shall proceed to validate the application. The city clerk shall validate the application by verifying that the proper number of signatures is contained on the application and that the persons signing the application are owners of real property abutting said street as required by this division. In the event that the city clerk determines that the application is invalid for any reason, or that the application does not contain sufficient signatures, the application shall be returned to the person or persons submitting such application, and it shall not be subject to further consideration by the governing body until such time as a new application is submitted and the city clerk validates the new application. 
                  e.  In determining the required percentage of the persons signing such application in connection with the validation thereof, where property abutting such street is owned by more than one person, the signature of only one such owner shall be counted in calculating such 75 percent. In addition, persons who rent or lease real property abutting such street may sign such application, but their signatures shall not be counted toward the 75 percent threshold for submission of the application to the governing body. Signatures on any such application signed more than 90 calendar days prior to the date of submission of the application to the city clerk shall be invalid and shall not be counted toward the 75 percent threshold. In the event that more than one application for naming a new street is presented to the city clerk, the city clerk shall validate such applications in the order received. The first application validated by the city clerk shall be presented to the governing body first, and only if the resolution to approve the application is denied shall the city clerk present the second or subsequent validated application to the governing body. 
                  f.  The application shall be in such form as established by the city clerk. At a minimum, the application shall indicate thereon the location of the street, the proposed name of the street, the printed name, street address, and signature of each property owner signing such application, and the date that each property owner signed the application. In addition, each such application shall include therewith a written statement which provides, in succinct detail, the reasons for the proposed street naming in honor of a particular person or business listed in the application. In providing such written statement, the criteria to be considered by the governing body regarding the naming of such street as more particularly established in this division shall be specifically addressed by the application in such written statement accompanying the street naming application. In addition, the application shall also list any public announcement or public recognition request that should accompany any official street naming ceremony undertaken by the city in connection with the naming of such street. 
                  g.  In the event that the city clerk determines that the application is valid, then prior to the submission of the application to the governing body, the city clerk shall undertake the following: 
                  1.  Provide notification of the application to and compile for review by the governing body responses to the application from the following: 
                  i.  All city agencies and departments, including, but not limited to; city police, city fire and EMS, city GIS system personnel, city building risk management risk department, and other city agencies or departments that the clerk deems appropriate; 
                  ii.  All other local, state, or national agencies which the city clerk determines may be affected by the naming of the street; 
                  iii.  All schools located in the immediate vicinity of the street; 
                  iv.  Any other persons or entities the city clerk deems, in his or her sole discretion, should receive notice of the proposed street naming. 
                  2.  Review existing public records for the purpose of establishing that the proposed street name does not duplicate any existing street name and is not confusingly similar to any existing street name in Americus or Sumter County. 
                  h.  Upon the completion of the foregoing, the city clerk shall be required to place consideration of the application on the agenda for the city council meeting occurring in the calendar month after the month in which the application was finally validated. Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the tabling of such proposal by the governing body, but in no event shall consideration of such proposal by the city council be delayed beyond 90 calendar days after the validated application was filed with the city clerk. 
                  i.  Prior to the governing body considering or voting upon such application, the governing body shall hold a public hearing regarding such application. Notice of such public hearing shall be published once in the city's legal organ no later than the day prior to the date of the public hearing. Such public notice shall advise the public regarding the application, the proposed new street name, and the time and place of the scheduled public hearing before the governing body. Such public hearing shall be conducted with the same formality as that required of public hearings in connection with zoning and rezoning matters before the governing body. Upon conclusion of the public hearing, the governing body shall be authorized to vote on the application. 
                  j.  In the event that the application is approved by an appropriate resolution of the governing body, the name of the street shall take effect at such time as is determined by the governing body in such resolution. 
                  k.  Upon adoption of the resolution by the governing body, the city clerk shall undertake the following: 
                  1.  Provide written notice to each property owner owning property abutting the street of the official name of the street as approved by the governing body; 
                  2.  Provide written notice of the name of the street to the United States Postal Service; 
                  3.  Provide written notice of the name of the street to the emergency 911 system in effect for the geographical area including the City of Americus. 
                  l.  Within 60 calendar days of the effective date of the resolution adopting the street name, the city utilities director shall have fabricated and installed appropriate signage regarding the name of the street at such locations as deemed appropriate by the utilities director. 
                  (2)  By the professional staff of the city. 
                  The professional staff of the city, or a member of the city council, may submit an application to name a new street. The procedures to be followed by the governing body in the event that such an application is submitted shall be the same procedures as previously outlined in this section, except that no application fee shall be required, and the application shall not require the signatures of 75 percent of the persons owning real property abutting the new street.

                  Sec. 78-153. - Determination of name. 
                  (a)  In making a determination as to the name to be given to a new street, if the street is proposed to be named after a natural person, the governing body shall take into consideration the following: 
                  (1)  Whether such person has resided for a long period of time on such street; 
                  (2)  Whether such person has made significant and long-lasting contributions to the city and its citizens; 
                  (3)  Whether such person is a national or internationally prominent figure who has or may have a direct or indirect connection to the city and its citizens; 
                  (4)  Whether such person has provided charitable or philanthropic contributions to the city and its citizens; 
                  (5)  Whether such person has brought honor, prestige, or recognition in a positive manner to the city and its citizens; 
                  (6)  Whether such person is a leader in local governmental, civic, educational, or public affairs; or 
                  (7)  Whether such person is a distinguished and accomplished scholar, scientist, educational leader, business leader, government leader, or civic leader. 
                  In order to be considered for having a street named after a person, such person may be either living or deceased at the time of the street naming. With respect to a deceased individual, the application shall not be submitted until at least one year after the date of death of such person. With respect to a living person, such person must have reached the age of 75 years at the time of the submission of the application, unless such age limitation is affirmatively waived by the governing body of the city within 30 calendar days after the filing of the application required by section 78-152. 
                  (b)  In the event that consideration is given to naming a new street after a business, an organization, or a nonprofit entity, the governing body of the city shall consider the following: 
                  (1)  Whether such entity is located upon such street; 
                  (2)  The length of time that such entity has been located on such street; 
                  (3)  The length of time that such entity has been located within the city; 
                  (4)  The civic, community, and educational contributions of the business to the city and its citizens; or 
                  (5)  The length of time that such entity is expected to remain in business under the same name on such street. 
                  No street shall be named after any ongoing business, organization, or nonprofit entity which is not located upon the street to be named in honor of such entity. 
                  (c)  In addition to the foregoing factors to be considered by the governing body in naming a new street, the governing body shall also be authorized to consider any and all other relevant factors that the governing body deems appropriate in making a street naming decision. 
                  (d)  Unless waived by the governing body, new streets which are obviously in alignment with streets already in existence and already named shall be given the name of the existing street. In addition, no applications proposing to change the name of only a portion of a street shall be accepted by the city clerk.

                  (1)  Whether such person has resided for a long period of time on such street; 
                  (2)  Whether such person has made significant and long-lasting contributions to the city and its citizens; 
                  (3)  Whether such person is a nationally or internationally prominent figure who has or may have a direct or indirect connection to the city and its citizens; 
                  (4)  Whether such person has provided charitable or philanthropic contributions to the city and its citizens;

                  Sec. 78-201. - Title. 
                  This article shall be known as the "city sidewalk installation article." 
                  (Ord. No. O-07-03-11, § 18-201, 3-22-2007) 
                  Sec. 78-202. - Definitions. 
                  The following words, terms, and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, as follows: 
                  City block is the smallest area that is surrounded by public streets within the incorporated area of the city. 
                  Lot owners means the owner or owners of record of each lot abutting a proposed sidewalk, whether or not there is constructed on such lot a dwelling, house, commercial building or other structure. Such term shall include both personal and business owners of such lots of record. 
                  Petition means a petition as more particularly described in section 78-203 of this article. 
                  (Ord. No. O-07-03-11, § 18-202, 3-22-2007) 
                  Sec. 78-203. - Petition. 
                  (a)  Whenever any lot owner or owners located within the corporate limits of the city desire to request the city to install a sidewalk fronting the property owned by such lot owner or owners along one or more sides of a city block, then such lot owner or owners shall notify the city clerk, who shall provide the lot owner or owners with a pre-printed petition, which petition shall be for the purpose of ascertaining the level of support for the installation of such sidewalk. At the time of providing the petition to the lot owner or owners, the city clerk shall determine an estimated installation cost of the proposed sidewalk, which cost shall be assessed to each lot owner in a prorated amount as established in this article, and such estimated cost shall be provided to the lot owner or owners requesting the application. 
                  (b)  Such petition shall have typed thereon a title, which shall be "Petition Requesting the City of Americus to Install a Sidewalk Along the ____________ Side of ____________ Street from ____________ Street to ____________ Street." There shall further be typed thereon the following statement at the top of each page of the petition: 
                  The undersigned, by signing this petition, do hereby request the City of Americus to install a sidewalk as described above. The undersigned have been informed and do understand that if at least 75 percent of the record owners of lots abutting such proposed sidewalk sign this petition, the governing body of the city may authorize the installation of such sidewalk, and each record owner of a lot or lots abutting said sidewalk shall be required to pay the pro-rated cost of installation of such sidewalk as established by city ordinance. 
                  (c)  Such petition shall thereafter have spaces for the printed name and address, the legal signature, and the date of signing for each lot owner who signs such petition. Such petition shall be returned to the city clerk within 90 calendar days of the date that the petition was delivered by the city clerk to the lot owner or owners requesting such petition. No such petition shall be returned to or accepted by the city clerk until at least 75 percent of the record lot owners abutting the proposed sidewalk shall have signed the petition. For purposes of ascertaining the 75 percent threshold, the following shall apply: 
                  (1)  A lot owner may be counted as signing the petition only once, regardless of the number of lots such lot owner may own abutting said sidewalk. 
                  (2)  Where property is owned by more than one person, the signature of only one such owner shall be counted in calculating such 75 percent. 
                  (3)  Persons who rent or lease property abutting such proposed sidewalk may sign such petition, but their signatures shall not be counted toward the 75 percent threshold. 
                  (4)  Where the lot owner is a corporation or other legal entity, the petition shall only be signed by an authorized officer or agent of the corporation. 
                  (d)  Upon submission of said petition as a single petition to the city clerk, the city clerk shall cause the signatures thereon to be verified. The city clerk shall validate the petition by verifying that the proper number of signatures is contained on the petition and that the persons signing the petition are owners of real property abutting said proposed sidewalk as required by this article. In the event that the city clerk determines that the petition is invalid for any reason, or if the application does not contain sufficient signatures, the application shall be returned to the person or persons submitting such application, and it shall not be subject to further consideration by the governing body until such time as a new application is submitted and the city clerk validates the new application. Any persons who are not record 
                  owners of lots abutting the proposed sidewalk, or who are otherwise not authorized to sign such petition or have their signatures counted, shall have their names stricken from the petition and shall not be counted for purposes of ascertaining the 75 percent threshold. 
                  (e)  If, after verification of the signatures, the city clerk determines that at least 75 percent of the lot owners owning real property abutting the proposed sidewalk have signed the petition, then said petition shall be presented to the governing body of the city at its next regular monthly meeting for consideration. In the event that the petition contains the properly verified signatures of at least 75 percent of the persons owning real property abutting the proposed sidewalk, the city council shall be authorized to approve the installation of the sidewalk, but the city council shall not be required to approve such installation. 
                  (f)  If the installation of such sidewalk is approved by the city council, the appropriate city departments shall proceed with the installation of such sidewalk, which installation shall be performed in accord with applicable building and other codes. 
                  (g)  The city shall provide all labor and materials required for the installation of the sidewalk. At the conclusion of the installation, the city clerk shall determine the actual total installation cost incurred by the city, including, but not limited to; the cost of labor, materials, right-of-way acquisition, surveys, and engineering costs. Such cost shall be determined within 30 calendar days of the completion of the installation. The finance director shall then determine the cost of the installation per linear foot and shall cause each lot owner abutting such subdivision to be billed an amount equal to such cost per linear foot times the number of linear feet owned by such lot owner abutting the installed sidewalk. Such bills shall be paid by the lot owners within 30 days of submission by the city. In the event that it is requested by one or more lot owners and approved by the governing body, and in lieu of payment of such cost of installation in one payment, as to any lot owner or owners so requesting, the city shall be authorized to bill each lot owner for such lot owner's prorated cost over a 12-month period; provided, however, that any lot owner requesting to be billed over a 12-month period shall also pay interest equal to one percent per month on the unpaid principal balance until all payments are paid in full. The sale of the lot prior to the lot owner's payment of such prorated cost shall not relieve the lot owner of the obligation to pay such cost in full as required by this article. Failure to pay any installment when due shall entitle the city to terminate utility services to the lot owner in the same manner as if the lot owner had failed to pay a city utility bill. Nothing herein shall prohibit the city from including the billing for the pro-rata share of the installation of such sidewalk to the lot owners in the lot owner's monthly utility bill.

                  (a)  The city shall not be required to install such sidewalk unless the city obtains from each lot owner a deed to such real property as the city may require in order for the city to construct said sidewalk. Such right-of-way shall be conveyed to the city in fee simple and at no cost or expense to the city. 
                  (b)  No application for the construction of a sidewalk shall be accepted by the city clerk hereunder, unless such application includes the construction and paving of a sidewalk for the distance of at least one side of a city block. 
                  (c)  No application shall be accepted by the city clerk hereunder for the repaving of an existing paved sidewalk.

                  Nothing in this article shall be construed to prohibit the city from undertaking to construct sidewalks at such locations as the city may deem appropriate and in the best interest of the city and its citizens, regardless of whether a petition as described in section 78-203 hereof, has been submitted to the city. Any such construction by the city shall be undertaken and completed at the sole cost and expense of the city.

                  (b)  It shall be unlawful for any person to use any public park, cemetery, public sidewalk, or public property for living accommodations or for camping, except in areas specifically designated for such use. 
                  (c)  It shall be unlawful for any person other than the owner, tenant, employee, or other person with permission from the owner, to camp, sleep, reside, store personal property upon, or lie down outside upon any private property without the owner's permission to do so. 
                  (d)  Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, this section shall not apply to the following:

                  Major streets means a street used primarily for fast or heavy traffic. 
                  Minor streets means a street used primarily for access to the abutting properties. 
                  Subdivision. 
                  (1)  The term "subdivision" means any division of a tract or parcel of land into two or more lots, building sites or other divisions for the purpose, whether immediate or the future sale, legacy or building development, and includes any division of land involving a new street or a change in one or more existing streets and includes resubdivision and, where appropriate to the context, relates to the process of subdividing or to the land or area subdivided.

                  Where the subdivider can show that a provision of these standards would cause unnecessary hardship if strictly adhered to, and where, because of topographical or other conditions peculiar to the site, in the opinion of the planning commission a departure may be made without destroying the intent of such provisions, the planning commission may authorize a variance.

                  Sec. 82-31. - Generally. 
                  (a)  The procedure for formal review and approval of a subdivision plat shall consist of the following three separate steps: 
                  (1)  The subdivider should consult early and informally with the community development director and/or other city technical staff for advice and assistance before the preparation of the preliminary sketch plat and its formal application for approval. This will enable the subdivider to become thoroughly familiar with these standards, the major street plan and other official plans or public improvements that might affect the area. Such informal review should prevent unnecessary and costly revisions. 
                  (2)  Prior to the making of any street improvement, or installations of utilities, the developer shall submit to the planning commission a preliminary plat of the proposed subdivision. After receiving the planning commission's approval of the preliminary plat and full concurrence and approval by the city, the developer may then proceed to grade the streets and install all improvements required by this chapter and any other applicable city ordinances. In lieu of the completion of all improvements prior to submission of the final plat, the developer may post a bond with the city, or certified check, in an amount and with surety satisfactory to the city and conditions satisfactory to the city, providing for and securing to the city the actual construction and installation of such improvements within a period specified by the planning commission and stated in the bond. 
                  (3)  After completion of the physical development of the subdivision or the posting of a bond or certified check to guarantee the same, the developer shall submit to the planning commission a final plat together with any required certificates. The final plat, along with any deed restrictions, becomes the instrument to be recorded in the office of the clerk of the superior court of this county. 
                  (b)  No final subdivision plat shall be approved by the planning commission or accepted for record by the office of the clerk of the superior court of this county until the required improvements listed shall be constructed in satisfactory manner and approved by the appropriate approving agent.

                  Sec. 82-57. - Basic requirements; minimum standards. 
                  (a)  Land which the planning commission has found to be unsuitable for subdivision due to flooding, bad drainage, steep slopes, rock formations, or other features likely to be harmful to the safety, health, and general welfare of the future residents shall not be subdivided unless adequate methods approved by the planning commission are formulated by the developer for meeting the problems created by the subdivision of such land. 
                  (b)  Land subject to flooding shall not be platted for residential occupancy or for such other uses, as will not comply with chapter 34, article II, the danger to health, life and property unless such land is not to be used as a building site. In applying this provision, land liable to flooding as determined from past history shall be considered subject to flood. Fill shall not be used to raise the land in areas subject to flood unless the fill proposed does not restrict the flow of water and unduly increase flood heights. 
                  (Code 1986, § 19-30; Ord. No. O-97-03-05, 3-20-1997) 
                  Sec. 82-58. - Streets. 
                  (a)  Conformity to the major street plan. The location and width of all streets and roads shall conform to the official major street plan; i.e., provision must be made for the location of thoroughfares as shown on the major street plan. 
                  (b)  Relation to adjoining street system. The proposed street system shall extend existing streets at the same or greater width, but in no case less than the required minimum width. It shall connect with streets already dedicated in adjacent subdivisions or where no such streets exist, it shall follow the projection of streets in related subdivided tracts so that other subdivisions may connect therewith. The city reserves the right to require the developer to meet minimum road design standards. 
                  (c)  Restriction of access. When a tract fronts on an arterial street or highway, the planning commission may require all residential lots to be provided with frontage on a minor residential street. 
                  (d)  Street right-of-way widths. The minimum width of right-of-way, measured from lot line to lot line, shall be as shown on the major street plan, or if not shown on such plan, shall be not less than as follows: 
                  (1)  Arterial streets and highways: 80 to120 feet. 
                  (2)  Collector streets: 60 feet. 
                  (3)  Commercial and industrial streets: 80 feet. 
                  (4)  Minor residential streets: 
                  a.  Curb and gutter: 50 feet. 
                  b.  Ditches: 60 feet. 
                  For both of the above, a 15-foot utility drainage easement shall be provided on each side of the right-of-way. 
                  (e)  Exceptions. In cases where topography or other physical conditions made a street of the required minimum width impracticable, the planning commission may modify the above requirements. Through proposed business areas the street widths shall be increased ten feet on each side if needed to provide parking without interference to normal passing traffic. 
                  (f)  Additional width on existing street. Subdivisions that join existing streets shall dedicate additional rights-of-way if needed to meet the above minimum street width requirements. 
                  (1)  The entire right-of-way shall be provided where any part of the subdivision is on both sides of the existing street. 
                  (2)  When the subdivision is located on only one side of an existing street, one-half of the required right-of-way, measured from the centerline of the existing roadway shall be provided. 
                  (g)  Street grades and elevations. Grades on major streets shall not exceed seven percent and grades on other streets shall not exceed 12 percent. 
                  (h)  Horizontal curves. Where a deflection angle of more than two degrees in the alignment of a street occurs, a curve of reasonably long radius shall be introduced. On streets 60 feet or more in width, the centerline radius of curvature shall be not less than 300 feet; on other streets it shall not be less than 100 feet. 
                  (i)  Vertical curves. All changes in grade shall be connected by vertical curves of minimum length in feet equal to 15 times the algebraic difference in rates of grade for major streets, and one-half this minimum length for other streets. Profiles of all streets showing natural and finished grades drawn to a scale of not less than one inch equals 100 feet horizontally and one inch equals 20 feet vertically may be required by the planning commission upon recommendation of the city utilities director. 
                  (j)  Intersections. Street intersections shall be as nearly at right angles as possible, and no intersection shall be at an angle of less than 60 degrees. Property line radii at street intersections shall not be less than 20 feet, and where the angle of street intersection is less than 75 degrees the planning commission may require a greater curb radius. To permit the construction of a curb having a desirable radius without curtailing the sidewalk at a street corner to less than normal width, the property line at such street corner shall be reduced or otherwise set back sufficiently to permit such construction. 
                  (k)  Tangents. A tangent of at least 100 feet long shall be introduced between reverse curves on all streets. 
                  (l)  Street jogs. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 125 feet shall not be allowed. 
                  (m)  Dead-end streets. 
                  (1)  Minor terminal streets or courts designed to have one end permanently closed shall be no more than 600 feet long unless necessitated by topography. They shall be provided at the closed end with a turnaround having an outside roadway diameter of at least 90 feet and a street right-of-way diameter of at least 110 feet for curb and gutter and 130 feet for ditches. 
                  (2)  Where phases may be proposed a temporary turnaround shall be provided. 
                  (n)  Private streets and reserve strips. There shall be no private streets platted in any subdivision. Every lot of subdivided property shall be served from a publicly dedicated street. There shall be no reserve strips controlling access to streets, except where the control of such strips is definitely placed with the city under conditions approved by the planning commission. 
                  (o)  Street names. Proposed streets that are obviously, in alignment with others already existing and named shall bear the names of existing streets. In no case shall the names for proposed streets duplicate names of existing streets, irrespective of the use of the suffix "street," "avenue," "boulevard," "driveway," "place" or "court." 
                  (p)  Alleys. Alleys shall be provided to the rear of all lots used for business purposes; alleys shall not be provided in residential blocks except where the subdivider produces evidence satisfactory to the planning commission of the need for alleys. 
                  (q)  Construction requirements. 
                  (1)  Every subdivision developer shall be required to make adequate provision for handling drainage problems, to grade and improve streets and alleys, to install curbs or invert ditches and to install street name signs in accordance with specifications established by the city utilities director. 
                  (2)  All street design and construction and related matters shall be in strict accordance with Georgia Department of Transportation Standard Specifications, volume 1 "Construction of Roads and Bridges" and volume 2 "Materials for Roads and Bridges" and all revisions thereto. Where circumstances dictate variations from the standard specifications, the city utilities director may vary the requirements providing the design or materials accepted are in all ways commensurate with good practice. 
                  (3)  All materials, equipment, labor and other matters related to street construction shall be provided by the developer. The following is a summary of the improvements required: 
                  a.  Grading. All streets, roads and alleys shall be graded to their full width by the subdivider so that pavements and sidewalks, if installed in the future can be constructed on the same level plane. The preparation of the right-of-way before grading is started and the construction of cuts and fills shall be accomplished according to the specifications of the city. 
                  b.  Storm drainage. An adequate drainage system, including necessary curbs, pipes, culverts, headwalls, intersectional drains, drop inlets, bridges, swale ditches, etc., shall be provided for the proper drainage of all surface water. 
                  c.  Installation of utilities. After grading is completed and approved and before any base is applied all of the underground work (water mains, gas mains, etc. and all service connections) shall be installed completely and approved throughout the length of the road and across the flat section. All driveways for houses to be built by the developer shall be cut and drained. 
                  d.  Roadway base. After preparation of the subgrade, the roadbed shall be properly based with one of the following: 
                  1.  A six-inch sand clay base (class B); 
                  2.  A six-inch graded aggregate base; or 
                  3.  Six-inch mixed in place soil cement base. 
                  e.  Roadway surfacing. The paved surface shall be a two-inch compacted asphalt plant mix. 
                  f.  Minimum pavement width. Minimum pavement including paved gutters between curbs shall be as follows: 
                  1.  Minor residential streets: 30 feet. 
                  2.  Access routes: 38 to 44 feet. 
                  3.  Arterial streets or through routes: As may be required. 
                  4.  Ditch sections: 24 feet. 
                  g.  Curbs. Where the subdivider elects to provide curbs or it is deemed essential and necessary by the city utilities director, a permanent six-inch Portland cement concrete curb and gutter with a longitudinal storm drain system shall be installed. Backfill shall slope toward the curb to ensure drainage of surface water into the storm drainage system. 
                  h.  Rural ditch section. Where the developer does not install curb and gutter, a rural ditch section shall be provided. Said ditch shall be constructed with a minimum of 3:1 slope on both sides of the ditch. And shall have a minimum channel width of at least two feet. All rural ditch sections shall be designed and constructed to accommodate a 25-year flood. No rural ditch section shall be constructed within a right-of-way less than 60 feet wide with a 15-foot utility/storm drainage easement, on both sides. All rural ditch sections shall be seeded or sodded to provide for a permanent stand of grass. 
                  i.  Outfall ditches. Outfall ditches shall be piped 130 feet from the right-of-way.

                  Sec. 82-60. - Lots. 
                  (a)  Arrangement. Insofar as practical, side lot lines shall be at right angles to straight street lines or radial to curved street lines. Each lot shall front upon a public street or road that is not less than 50 feet in width. Each lot shall be at least 30 feet in width at the front property line. 
                  (b)  Minimum size. The size, shape and orientation of lots shall be such, as the planning commission deems appropriate for the type of development and use contemplated. Where a public sanitary sewer is reasonably accessible, the subdivider shall connect with such sewer and provide a connection to each lot. Where a public sewer is not accessible, an alternate method of sewage disposal may be used when meeting all applicable public health regulations. 
                  (1)  Residential lots served by a public sewer system shall be not less than 60 feet wide at the building setback line, nor less than 7,000 square feet in area. Where a rural ditch section is used, each lot shall maintain a 100-foot width at the setback line, not less than 13,000 square feet in size, and maintain a minimum frontage at the right-of-way line of 50 feet. Where a cul-de-sac is constructed using the rural ditch section method, the maximum number of lots on a cul-de-sac shall be five lots, with a minimum right-of-way diameter of 130 feet, and a minimum paving diameter being 90 feet. 
                  (2)  For residential lots not served by a public sewer system, the planning commission shall require that data from percolation tests be submitted as a basis for approving subdivisions dependent upon septic tanks as a means of sewage disposal, and no lot shall be less than 100 feet wide at the building line, nor less than 15,000 square feet in area. 
                  (3)  For residential lots not served by a public water supply or a public sewer system, no lot shall be less than 100 feet wide at the building line, nor less than one acre in size except upon approval of the county health officer and in no case shall any lot be less than one-half acre in size. 
                  (4)  The minimum size of residential lots to be served by a private source of water supply shall be determined by the county health officer after investigations of soil conditions, proposed sewer system and depth of groundwater. 
                  (5)  Size of properties reserved or laid out for commercial or industrial properties shall be adequate to provide for the off-street service and parking facilities required by the type of use and development contemplated. Platting of individual lots shall be avoided in favor of an overall design of the land to be used for such purposes. 
                  (6)  The size and widths of lots shall in no case be less than the minimum requirements of the zoning regulations in effect. 
                  (c)  Building setback lines. The minimum depth of building setback lines from any street shall be 30 feet. If, however, suitable provision is made in connection with the plat or restrictions pertaining to the plat, building lines may be varied, provided such variation does not reduce the setback more than five feet. Where rural ditch section construction for a subdivision is used the minimum building setback line from any street right-of-way shall be 50 feet for any zoning district. 
                  (d)  Corner lots. Corner lots shall be sufficiently wider and larger to permit the additional side yard requirements of the zoning regulations or building setback lines outlined above.

                  Sec. 82-61. - Utilities. 
                  (a)  Water. Water mains for both domestic use and fire protection shall be properly connected with the city water system. The lines shall conform with accepted standards of good practice for municipal water systems, and shall meet, as a minimum, the requirements of the state environmental protection division and the city. All materials, labor, equipment, and other matters related to the water distribution system shall be provided by the developer. 
                  (b)  Sewer. When the subdivision is located within the service area of a public sewer system, sanitary sewers shall be installed in such a manner as to serve adequately all lots with connection to the public system. Where lots cannot be economically connected with a sewer system, they must contain adequate area for the installation of approved septic tank and disposal fields and must be approved in writing by the county health officer. All materials, equipment, labor, and other matters related to the sanitary sewer system shall be provided by the developer and all sewer facilities shall be installed in accordance with the standards of the department of human resources of the state and standards of the city. 
                  (c)  Installation of utilities. After grading is completed and approved and before any base is applied to the street, all of the underground work, water mains, gas mains, etc., and all service connections shall be installed completed and approved throughout the length of the road and across the flat section. Where the utility mains are off the pavement, the developer may elect to omit the installation of service connections providing that at such time as these service connections are needed, they may be jacked across the street without breaking or weakening the existing pavement. 
                  (d)  Easements for utilities. Except where alleys are permitted for that purpose, the city may require easements for poles, wires, conduits, storm and sanitary sewers, gas, and water mains or other utility lines, along rear lot lines or side lot lines, if, in the opinion of the city utilities director such action is desirable. Easements of the same or greater width may be required along the line of or across lots, where necessary for the extension of existing or planned utilities. Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway, channel or stream, there shall be provided a stormwater easement or drainage right-of-way along each side for the purpose of widening, depending, relocating, improving or protecting such drainage easement. 
                  (e)  Street lighting. Either underground or overhead electrical service shall be provided by the developer of a subdivision, through a public utility. All subdivisions with underground electrical lines shall have placed appropriate utility poles for street lighting. The installation of streetlights shall adhere to the following requirements: streetlights shall be installed at each street intersection and streetlights that are to be installed along the proposed blocks shall be equally spaced between street intersections. However, the maximum distance between any two streetlights shall not exceed 400 feet in length. After construction has been completed for an accepted phase or for an entire subdivision, and where the streets have been dedicated to the city, the city will be responsible for the costs associated with the operation of the streetlights. Streetlight design, size, and wattage must be approved by the city as part of the preliminary platting process. For example, a block 800 feet in length, it would be necessary to install three streetlights. For a block 1,100 feet in length, four streetlights would be necessary.

The top of the monument shall have an indented cross to identify properly the location and shall be set flush with the finished grade. All other lot, corners shall be marked with iron pipe not less than three-fourths inches in diameter and 24 inches long and driven so as to be flush with the finished grade.

                  Sec. 82-63. - Large tracts. 
                  When land is subdivided into larger parcels than ordinary building lots, such parcels shall be arranged so as to allow for the opening of future streets and logical further resubdivision. 
                  (Code 1986, § 19-36; Ord. No. O-97-03-05, 3-20-1997)

                  A comprehensive group housing development, including the large scale construction of housing units together with necessary drives and ways of access, may be approved by the planning commission although the design of the project does not include standard street, lot and subdivision arrangements, if departure from the foregoing standards can be made without destroying their intent. The developer shall provide proof that adequate access is provided for emergency vehicles.

                  Sec. 90-78. - Authority to extend; service charges. 
                  (a)  The city council shall be authorized to extend or cause to be extended water main lines and sewer main lines into commercial areas, both inside and outside the city limits where the city council deems it appropriate and in the best interest of the city to do so. 
                  (b)  In considering the extension of such water mains and sewer mains, the city council shall take into consideration past commercial business growth patterns and anticipated commercial business growth patterns, both inside and outside the city limits. The city council shall also weigh the net cost to the city of such extensions against the potential increased revenues to the city realized or anticipated to result from such extensions due to increased economic development activity. 
                  (c)  In the event that the city council determines that it is appropriate to extend water mains and sewer mains into commercial areas, either inside or outside the city limits, the city shall be authorized to charge to new water and sewer customers, in addition to tap charges, service deposits, meter costs and monthly water and sewer rates, an amount determined by the city which will reimburse the city for all reasonable costs of extending such water mains and sewer mains based upon the linear front footage of the property to be served by such water main and sewer main extensions. Such costs need not be paid by a property owner or owners until such time as the property owner or owners desire to purchase city water and city sewer services, and such charges may be paid as part of the initial tap charges otherwise authorized in this Code. In addition to the foregoing, the city shall be authorized to charge interest on such amounts from the date that such water and sewer service becomes available to the date that such charges are paid in an amount to be determined by the city. 
                  (d)  The charges authorized hereunder shall be in addition to all other charges authorized to persons or businesses who utilize city water and city sewer services, whether inside or outside the city limits. 
                  (e)  The commercial business shall be required to pay the full cost of installing water and sewer lines from the main line to a commercial business building or buildings located on the premises, and the city shall have no responsibility or liability therefor. 
                  (f)  The provisions of this section shall not apply to residential subdivisions, or to the extension of water mains and sewer mains by the city to serve a single residence or a single commercial business. Under such circumstances, the city shall be authorized to undertake such extensions and shall be authorized to charge the full cost of such extensions to such residential or commercial customer.

                  DIVISION 3. - RESIDENTIAL AREAS 

                  Sec. 90-100. - Authority to extend. 
                  The city council shall be authorized to extend or cause to be extended water main lines and sewer main lines into residential areas, both inside and outside the city limits, where the city council deems it appropriate and in the best interest of the city to do so. For purposes of this division, the term "residential areas" shall include all areas inside and outside the city limits which are zoned for any type of residential development. 
                  (Code 1986, § 13-161; Ord. No. O-99-01-03, § 1, 1-21-1999) 
                  Sec. 90-101. - Investigation; survey; estimated costs. 
                  (a)  In the event that the utilities director shall determine that there is an area within the city or outside the city limits which should have access to city water and city sewerage, the utilities director shall conduct a preliminary investigation of the area to determine the estimated cost, feasibility, and if appropriate, the time frame within which water mains and sewer mains could be installed to serve such area. The utilities director shall then make a written report of his findings to the city manager of the city, who shall review such findings and submit them to the city council for review. 
                  (b)  Upon review of the findings, the city council shall be authorized to undertake one of the following three options: 
                  (1)  The council can determine that the proposed installation of water and sewer lines in such area is not feasible, not cost effective, or is a project that the city should not undertake at the present time. 
                  (2)  In the event that the area studied is an area where residential property has already been developed, then the city council shall be authorized to direct the city manager of the city to undertake a survey of the property owners in the area to determine whether or not they desire the construction of such improvements in the area. An estimated cost of such extension that would have to be paid by such property owners, if any, shall be submitted to said property owners as part of such survey. Unless the city council shall determine that public health and safety concerns exist so as to require such installation, in the discretion of the city council, no such extension shall be undertaken by the city unless at least 60 percent of the property owners in the subject area respond affirmatively to such survey. 
                  (3)  In the event that the subject area has not been developed as a residential area, then the city council shall direct the city manager to conduct a survey, as referred to in subsection (b)(2) of this section, of the property owners in the subject area in the same manner. Unless the city council shall determine that public health and safety concerns exist so as to require such installation, in the discretion of the city council, no such extension shall be undertaken by the city unless 100 percent of the property owners in the subject area respond affirmatively to such survey.

                  Sec. 90-102. - Completion of survey; determination of special or general benefits. 
                  (a)  The survey shall be completed within 90 days after the city manager is directed to commence such survey. In the event that the required percentage approval from the property owners is met as a result of the survey, or in the event that the city council determines that public health and safety concerns exist so as to require the installation of the water and sewer improvements, the city council shall determine whether or not a special benefit will accrue to those property owners gaining access to the city's water and sewer system. In the event that such a special benefit will accrue as determined by the city council, the city council shall compare such special benefit with the general benefit derived by taxpayers of the city in general as a result of such improvements. If the comparison of the special benefit to the general benefit derived by taxpayers of the city in general results in a conclusion that the special benefit to the taxpayers of the subject area in expanding the water and sewer system to said area will outweigh the general benefit derived by taxpayers of the city in general, then in such event, the city council shall determine what portion of the cost of extending the city's water and sewer line to the subject area will be paid by the city, if any. If the city council determines that the general benefit to be derived by taxpayers of the city in general outweighs the special benefit to the property owners in the subject area, then the city shall pay the total cost of the extension of the water and sewer line. 
                  (b)  In the event that the city determines there is a special benefit to the property owners in the subject area, the city shall determine what portion of such cost each property owner shall pay for such water and sewer extension. If finally approved, the portion of the cost of the water and sewer line extension payable by the property owners in the subject area shall be paid to the city in accord with the provisions of this division. 
                  (Code 1986, § 13-163; Ord. No. O-99-01-03, § 3, 1-21-1999; Ord. No. O-2015-15, 7-23-2015) 
                  Sec. 90-103. - Boundary of subject area; total costs; assessment. 
                  (a)  At the next regular meeting of the city council after completion of the survey and the tabulations of the results thereof, or at such other time as the city council may determine. The city council may consider a resolution establishing the boundary of the subject area to be served by the water and sewer extensions and identifying all of the property or properties in the subject area which will benefit from access to such extension. Such resolution shall also provide the following: 
                  (1)  The total cost of the proposed project; 
                  (2)  The proposed method of assessment as to each property owner; 
                  (3)  A good faith estimate of the proposed assessment against each property; and 
                  (4)  A date, place, and time for a public hearing to be held on the merits of the project and on any objections thereto. 
                  (b)  Such resolution, if approved by the city council, shall be deemed to conditionally approve the project under the terms and conditions as set out in the resolution, but such project shall not proceed until after the public hearing and after the city council has approved a final resolution approving the project in accord with the terms of such final resolution. 
                  (c)  Notice of the public hearing, referred to in subsection (b) of this section, shall be given to every property owner identified in the preliminary resolution as potentially benefiting from access to the proposed water and sewer line improvements. Such notice shall be given in writing and mailed to such property owners by certified mail, return receipt requested, at the address shown on the city tax digest for the mailing of tax notices. Such notices shall be mailed at least 15 days prior to the date of the public hearing and shall include a copy of the preliminary resolution as approved by the city council. Such notice shall also specify the date, time, and location of the hearing and advise such property owners of their right to attend said hearing and to testify at said hearing. Such notice shall also be published by the city manager or his designee at least once a week for two consecutive weeks in the legal organ of the city. The time fixed for the public hearing shall be not less than five nor more than ten days after the date of the last publication of such notice. 
                  (d)  The city council shall hold the public hearing on the date, time, and place specified for the purpose of hearing supporting comments, complaints, objections that may be made by any interested persons concerning the project, including, but not limited to, the need for such water and sewer extension, the basis of apportioning costs between the city and the property owners, or the amount of the proposed assessment. The city council shall consider such comments and shall also be authorized to accept written comments from interested parties. 
                  (e)  At the next regular meeting of the city council, or at such other time as the city council may direct, the city council shall be authorized to consider a final resolution authorizing the project. Such resolution shall not be approved at the meeting at which it is first read without unanimous consent of the members of the city council, but shall be voted upon by the city council at the time of the second reading of such resolution. Such resolution shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following determinations. 
                  (1)  The boundary of the subject area to be served by the water and sewer extension; 
                  (2)  The projected cost of the improvements; 
                  (3)  The proposed method of assessment of such costs against the property owners; 
                  (4)  A good faith estimate of the proposed assessment against each property owner; and 
                  (5)  The date on which such assessments shall be due and payable to the city.

                  Sec. 90-104. - Notice of assessment. 
                  (a)  The city manager of the city, or his designee, shall, not less than 30 days before the date on which the payment of an assessment shall be due, cause written notice of such assessment to be sent to each affected property owner by certified mail, return receipt requested. The notice shall inform the property owner of the amount of the assessment, that the assessment is payable to the finance director of the city, that if paid on or before the due date, such assessment shall be without interest, and that if such assessment is not paid by the due date, the amount of such assessment shall be a lien against the lot or tracts of land subject to the assessment, and such lien shall continue in force until the assessment and all interest is fully paid. The interest to be charged on assessments not paid when due shall be determined by the city council in the final resolution in section 90-103. 
                  (b)  In addition to the foregoing notice of the property owner's right to pay such assessment in installments, as provided in this division, shall also be contained in the notice required under this section.

                  Sec. 90-105. - Action to enjoin or contest assessments. 
                  No action shall be authorized to set aside any assessment, to enjoin the collection of any assessment, to enjoin the issuance of any execution therefor, or to contest the validity of an assessment on any legal or equitable grounds, unless such action is commenced within 30 days after the receipt of the notice provided for in section 90-104.

                  Sec. 90-106. - Payment of assessment by installments. 
                  When an assessment is imposed against a property owner for the installation of water and sewer lines as set out in this division, and the property owner desires to pay the assessment in installments, the property owner shall be authorized to pay such assessment in installments if notice of such election shall be given by the property to the chief administrator officer of the city on or before the due date of the assessment, subject to the following terms: 
                  (1)  The assessment may be amortized over such length of time as requested by the property owner, but no such assessment may be amortized over more than seven years. 
                  (2)  The interest rate to be charged to a property owner shall be based upon the cost of funds to the city in connection with such project, plus administrative expenses and costs incurred by the city in administering the payments. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the water and sewer line extension project is paid for with cash funds from the city's water and sewer fund, the interest rate to be charged to property owners who amortize their assessment shall be the rate that the money expended for such extension would have earned if such money had been invested in one-year certificates of deposit, plus administrative expenses and costs incurred by the city in administering the payments. 
                  (3)  Each assessment amortized, as provided in this section, shall be repaid in equal monthly installments of principal and interest according to an amortization schedule provided by the city manager. Such assessments shall be evidenced by a promissory note and such other documents as may be deemed necessary or appropriate to evidence such indebtedness and to secure the repayment thereof. In the event that the property owner is a utility customer of the city, the city shall be authorized to add the monthly installment to the monthly utility bill of the property owner. In the event the property owner is not a utility customer of the city, a monthly installment shall be billed to the property owner by the city. 
                  (4)  The amount of the assessment shall be a lien against the property of the property owner subject to such assessment until such time as all principal and interest are fully paid. Such liens shall be levied, enforced, and collected in the same manner as provided for the collection of city taxes. 
                  (5)  In the event that any installment is not paid in full when due, the finance director of the city shall be authorized to notify the property owner that the assessment is in default and such officer shall be further authorized to declare the entire unpaid balance, with interest, costs, and expenses, immediately due and payable. 
                  (6)  Upon the sale, donation, gift, or other transfer by operation of law of any real property subject to such a lien, such assessment shall be due and payable in full at the time of such transfer; provided, however, that transfers of property solely for the purpose of securing a bona fide indebtedness of the property owner shall not require payment in full of such lien upon such transfer. 
                  (7)  Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section regarding the repayment of such assessments amortized over a period of years, in the event that the subject area has no residential dwellings located on it at the time of the approval of the final resolution approving the project as provided in this division, then, in such event, the property owners shall be authorized to enter into an agreement with the city to provide that such assessment shall be paid, with interest as aforesaid, at the time that each lot in the proposed development is sold, provided that the entire assessment, whether or not all lots subject to such assessment have been sold, shall be paid no later than seven years from the initial due date of the assessment. All other provisions of this division relating to interest rates, liens for assessments, and default shall be applicable to such property owners.

No money in said special fund shall be used for any other purpose until such time as all costs of such project have been paid in full. In the event that any funds remain in the special fund after the project has been paid for in full, then such remaining funds shall be transferred to the city water and sewer fund.

                  "Sewer line extension costs" means the cost to be incurred by the city is extending existing city sewerage line from the existing city sewerage system to a location from which the subject property could be served. Such cost shall include, but shall not be limited to, the cost of easement or right-or-way acquisition. 
                  "Subject property" means the improved real property located outside the incorporated limits of the city which the property owner is seeking to annex into the city.

If such departments determine, as a result of such initial review, that the property to be annexed is "qualified property" under this division, then the departments shall jointly determine whether it is economically feasible from a financial standpoint for the governing body to provide the property owner, as a condition of annexation, reduced costs and fees for water line extensions, sewer line extensions, water tap fees, and sewer tap fees. No such cost or fee reductions shall be authorized unless the net cost of such project shall result in a financial benefit to the city.

                  (1)  The governing body of the city must determine, based upon the financial benefit determination, that the project would bring economic development to the city in the form of increased private sector employment, increased ad valorem tax revenue to the city, or increased net revenue to the city's utility system. 
                  (2)  The costs and fees may be amortized over such length of time as approved by the governing body of the city, but the repayment of such costs and fees may not be amortized over a period of more than seven years. 
                  (3)  The interest rate to be charged to a property owner in connection with the payment of such installment payments shall be as determined by the governing body of the city, taking into account the cost of funds to the city in connection with the project, current prevailing interest rates in the private sector, plus administrative costs and expenses incurred and to be incurred by the city in collecting and administering such installment payments. 
                  (4)  Such costs and fees to be paid in installments shall be repaid in equal monthly installments of principal and interest according to a written amortization schedule. At the time that the city and the property owner agree to the monthly repayment amounts, the property owner shall execute and deliver to the city the property owner's promissory note and such other documents as may be deemed necessary or appropriate to evidence such indebtedness and to secure the repayment thereof. In the event that the property owner is a utility customer of the city, the city shall be authorized to add the monthly installment payment to the monthly utility bill of the property owner or the property owner's tenant in the case of leased property. 
                  (5)  Prior to any installment payment being authorized under this section, the property owner must be determined by the governing body to be sufficiently creditworthy to insure to the governing body, to the extent reasonably possible, that the property owner will have the financial ability to pay such indebtedness within the term established by the city. 
                  (6)  The amount of the costs and fees to be paid in installments shall constitute a lien against the property of the property owner benefitted by such utility services until such time as all principal and interest are paid in full. Evidence of such lien shall be executed by the property owner and shall be recorded in the deed records in the Office the Clerk of the Superior Court of Sumter County, Georgia. The city clerk shall be authorized to cancel such lien upon the full payment thereof. Such liens shall be levied, enforced, and collected in the same manner as provided for the collection of city ad valorem taxes. 
                  (7)  Upon the sale, donation, gift, foreclosure, or the transfer of or operation of law of all or a portion of the real property subject to such lien, any remaining unpaid amounts of such costs and fees shall be due and payable in full at the time of such transfer unless the governing body of the city approves the assumption of such remaining obligations by the person or entity acquiring all or a portion of the subject property.

                  (e)  Local discharge limits. Using EPA approved methodology the city has established local discharge limits for the pollutants of concern to the POTW. These limits are designed to protect the receiving stream, prevent interference with POTW operations and protect the quality of the sludge produced by the POTW. These limits apply to all users of the system. For industrial users subject to national categorical pretreatment standards, the local limit will be compared to the categorical limit and the lower value will be used. The city reserves the right to set higher discharge limits for individual industrial users provided that the following conditions apply: 
                  (1)  There are no other industrial users discharging the pollutant of concern or if there are other significant industrial users discharging the pollutant of concern they are discharging below the established limit; 
                  (2)  If any other significant industrial users are discharging the pollutant of concern they agree to accept a lower limit; and 
                  (3)  The total combined loading on the POTW will not exceed the established maximum head works loading. 
                  Any user that desires to have a higher local discharge limit should petition the utilities director in writing. 
                  (f)  Any discharge to the POTW that contains concentrations of conventional pollutants above the local discharge limit will be subject to surcharges as provided in this division. For purposes of this division conventional pollutants are considered biochemical oxygen demand, total suspended solids, chemical oxygen demand, ammonia nitrogen, and oil and grease. 
                  (g)  All other regulated pollutants are considered nonconventional pollutants and any discharge to the POTW that contains concentrations of these pollutants above the local discharge limit will be subject to enforcement action as provided in this division.

                  a.  The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the applicable pretreatment standards, such events include, but are not limited to, hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts for major components, commencing and completing construction, and beginning and conducting routine operation; 
                  b.  No increment referred to in subsection (d)(2)a of this section shall exceed nine months; 
                  c.  The user shall submit a progress report to the utilities director no later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final date of compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate, the steps being taken by the user to return to the established schedule; and 
                  d.  In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress reports to the utilities director. 
                  (3)  Reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadline. Within 90 calendar days following the date for final compliance with applicable pretreatment standards or, in the case of a new source, following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any user subject to pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the city a report containing the information described in subsection (d)(1)b of this section. For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR 403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's longterm production rate. For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production, or other measure of operation, this report shall include the user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with subsection (b)(7) of this section. 
                  (4)  Periodic compliance reports. 
                  a.  All significant industrial users shall, at a frequency determined by the city but in no case less than twice per year, submit a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with subsection (b)(7) of this section. 
                  b.  All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
                  c.  If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the city, using the procedures prescribed in subsection (d)(11) of this section, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report. 
                  (5)  Reports of changed conditions. Each user must notify the city of any planned significant changes to the user's operations or system, which might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater at least 90 days before the change. 
                  a.  The city may require the user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under subsection (b) of this section. 
                  b.  The city may issue a wastewater discharge permit under subsection (c) of this section or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under subsection (c)(4) of this section in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions. 
                  c.  For purposes of this requirement, significant changes include, but are not limited to, flow increases of 20 percent or greater, and the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants. 
                  (6)  Reports of potential problems. 
                  a.  In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to accidental discharges, discharges of nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch discharge, or a slug load, that may cause potential problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the plant superintendent of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user. 
                  b.  Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless waived by the city, submit a detailed written report describing the causes of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this division. 
                  c.  A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a discharge described in paragraph a. above. Employers shall ensure that all employees, who may cause such a discharge to occur, are advise of the emergency notification procedure. 
                  (7)  Reports from unpermitted users. All users not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the city as the city may require. 
                  (8)  Notice of violation/repeat sampling and reporting. If sampling performed by the user indicates a violation, the user must notify the city within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the city within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. The user is not required to resample if the city monitors at the user's facility at least once a month, or if the city samples between the user's initial sampling and when the user receives the results of this sampling. 
                  (9)  Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste. 
                  a.  Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge, continuous, batch, or other. If the user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: 
                  1.  Identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes; 
                  2.  Estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month; and 
                  3.  Estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. 
                  All notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this subsection (d)(9) need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under subsection (d)(5) of this section. The notification requirement in this subsection (d)(9) does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of subsections (c)(2)a.4 and (e)(1)c of this section. 
                  b.  Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of subsection (d)(9)a of this section during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
                  c.  In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the city, the EPA regional waste management division director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations. 
                  d.  In the case of any notification made under this subsection (d)(9), the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
                  e.  This provision does not create the right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this division, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law. 
                  (10)  Analytical requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by EPA. 
                  (11)  Sample collection. 
                  a.  Except as indicated in subsection (d)(11)b of this section, the user must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the city may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits. 
                  b.  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfide, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. 
                  (12)  Timing. Written reports will be deemed, to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports, which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern. 
                  (13)  Recordkeeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this division shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this division and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, name of the person taking the samples; the dates analysis were performed; who performed the analysis; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analysis. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or the city, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the city. 
                  (e)  Compliance monitoring. 
                  (1)  Right of entry; inspection and sampling. The city shall have the right to enter the premises of any user to determine whether the user is complying with all requirements of this division and any wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder. Users shall allow the city ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties. 
                  a.  Where a user has security measures in force, which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, the city personnel will be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities. 
                  b.  The city shall have the right to set up on the user's property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and metering of the user's operations. 
                  c.  The city may require the user to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated on at least an annual basis to ensure their accuracy. 
                  d.  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user at the written or verbal request of the city and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be born by the user. 
                  e.  Unreasonable delays in allowing the city access to the user's premises shall be a violation of this division. 
                  (2)  Search warrants. If the city has been refused access to a building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this division, or that there is need to inspect and sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program of the city designed to verify compliance with this division or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the city may seek issuance of a search warrant from the municipal court of the city. 
                  (f)  Confidential information. Information and data on a user obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits, monitoring programs, and from inspections shall be available to the public, EPD, EPA or other governmental agency without restriction unless the user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city, EPD, and EPA, that release of such information would divulge information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the user. Users wishing to keep such information confidential must assert a claim of confidentiality at the time the information is submitted to the city, such confidential information may be withheld from the public but it will always be made available to the EPD and EPA. Effluent data will be available to the public without restriction. 
                  (g)  Publication of significant noncompliance. The city shall publish annually, in the largest daily newspaper published in the city, a list of the users that, during the previous 12 months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. The term "significant noncompliance" means: 
                  (1)  Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which 66 percent or more of wastewater measurements taken during a six-month period exceed the daily maximum limit or average limit for the same pollutant parameter by any amount; 
                  (2)  Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which 33 percent or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant parameter during a six-month period equals or exceeds the product of the daily maximum limit or the average limit multiplied by the applicable criteria; 1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH; 
                  (3)  Any other discharge violation that the city believes has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or passthrough, including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public; 
                  (4)  Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment to the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the city's exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge;

                  Sec. 90-259. - Administrative enforcement remedies. 
                  (a)  Notification of violation. Whenever the city finds that any user has violated or is violating this division, or a wastewater permit or order issued hereunder, the utilities director or his agent may serve upon said user written notice of violation. Within ten days of the receipt date of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted to the utilities director or his agent. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. 
                  (b)  Consent orders. The utilities director is hereby empowered to enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period also specified by the order. Consent orders shall have the same force and effect as compliance orders issued pursuant to subsection (d) of this section. 
                  (c)  Show cause hearing. The utilities director may order any user which causes or contributes to a violation of this division or wastewater permit or order issued hereunder, to show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, at least ten days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any user. Whether or not a duly notified user appears as noticed, immediate enforcement action may be pursued. 
                  (d)  Compliance order. When the utilities director finds that a user has violated or continues to violate this division or a permit or order issued thereunder, he may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that, following a specified time period, sewer service shall be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances have been installed and are properly operated. Orders may also contain such other requirements as might be reasonably necessary and appropriate to address the noncompliance, including the installation of pretreatment technology, additional self-monitoring, and management practices. 
                  (e)  Cease and desist orders. When the utilities director finds that a user has violated or continues to violate this division or any permit or order issued hereunder, the utilities director may issue an order to cease and desist all such violations and direct those persons in noncompliance to: 
                  (1)  Comply forthwith; 
                  (2)  Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and terminating the discharge. 
                  (f)  Administrative fines. Notwithstanding any other section of this division, any user who is found to have violated any provision of this division, or permits or orders issued hereunder, shall be fined in an amount not to exceed $1,000.00 per violation. Each day on which noncompliance shall occur or continue shall be deemed a separate and distinct violation. Such assessments may be added to the user's next scheduled sewer service charge and the city shall have such other collection remedies as it needs to collect other individual user's property. Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a request for the city to reconsider the fine within ten days of being notified of the fine. Where the utilities director believes a request has merit, he shall convene a hearing on the matter within 15 days of receiving the request from the industrial user. 
                  (g)  Emergency suspensions. 
                  (1)  The utilities director may suspend the wastewater treatment service and wastewater permit of a user whenever such suspension is necessary in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge presenting or causing imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons, the POTW, or the environment. 
                  (2)  Any user notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment service and/or the wastewater permit shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the utilities director shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The utilities director shall allow the user to recommence its discharge when the endangerment has passed, unless termination proceedings set forth in subsection (h) of this section are initiated against the user. A user who is the subject of a suspension order under this subsection shall have the right to appeal to the utilities director from such suspension, but such suspension shall remain in full force and effect pending such hearing and the decision of the director thereto. 
                  (3)  A user which is responsible, in whole or in part, for imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence to the utilities director prior to the date of the hearing described in subsection (g)(2) of this section. 
                  (h)  Termination of permit. Significant industrial users proposing to discharge into the POTW, must first obtain a wastewater discharge permit from the public works department. Any user who violates the following conditions of this division or a wastewater discharge permit or order, or any applicable state and federal law, is subject to permit termination: 
                  (1)  Violation of permit conditions; 
                  (2)  Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge; 
                  (3)  Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater constituents and characteristics; or 
                  (4)  Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling. 
                  Any noncompliant industrial users will be notified of the proposed termination of their wastewater permit and will be offered an opportunity to show cause under subsection (c) of this section, why the proposed action should not be taken. 
                  (i)  Termination of services. The city may order any user who causes or continues to allow an unauthorized discharge to enter the POTW to show cause before the city council as to why termination of services should not happen. A notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place of a hearing to be held by the city council regarding the termination of services, the reasons why the action is to be taken, and directing the user to show cause before the city council why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, at least ten days before the hearing. Service may be made on any agent or officer of a corporation. The city council may itself conduct the hearing and take the evidence, or may designate any of its members or any officer or employee of the public works to: 
                  (1)  Issue in the name of the city council notices of the hearing requesting the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence relevant to any matter involved in such hearings; 
                  (2)  Take the evidence; 
                  (3)  Transmit a report of the evidence and hearing, including transcripts and other evidence, together with recommendations to the city council for action thereon. At any hearing held pursuant to this division, testimony must be taken under oath and recorded stenographically. The transcript, so recorded, will be made available to any member of the public or any party to the hearing upon payment of the usual charges thereof. 
                  (j)  Order from city council to discontinue service. After the city council has reviewed the evidence, it may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that, following a specified time period, the sewer service is to be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are properly operated. Further orders and directives as are necessary and appropriate may be issued. 
                  (Code 1986, § 13-88; Ord. No. O-98-05-19, 5-21-1998) 
                  Sec. 90-260. - Judicial remedies. 
                  If any person discharges sewage, industrial wastes, or other wastes into the wastewater disposal system contrary to the provisions of this division or any order or permit issued hereunder, the utilities director, through the city attorney, may commence an action for appropriate legal and/or equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction. 
                  (1)  Injunctive relief. Whenever a user has violated or continues to violate this division or any order or permit issued hereunder, the city, through counsel may petition the court for its issuance of a preliminary or permanent injunction or both, as may be appropriate, which restrains or compels the activities on the part of the user. The city may also initiate nuisance abatement proceedings in the municipal court of the city, as an alternate remedy. 
                  (2)  Civil penalties. 
                  a.  Any user who has violated or continues to violate this division or any order or permit issued hereunder, shall be liable to the city for a civil penalty of up to at least $1,000.00 plus actual damages incurred by the POTW per violation per day for as long as the violation continues. In addition to the above described penalty and damages, the city may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with the enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses. 
                  b.  The city shall petition the municipal court of the city or any state court having jurisdiction to impose, assess, and recover such sums. In determining the amount of liability, the municipal court of the city or any state court having jurisdiction shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factors as justice requires. 
                  (3)  Criminal prosecution. 
                  a.  Any user who willfully or negligently violates any provision of this division or any orders or permits issued hereunder shall, upon conviction in the municipal court of the city, be guilty of a misdemeanor. 
                  b.  Any user who knowingly makes any false statements, representations, or certifications in any application, record, report, plan or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this division, or wastewater permit, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this division shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.

                  Sec. 90-261. - Supplemental enforcement remedies. 
                  (a)  Performance bonds. The utilities director may decline to reissue a permit to any industrial user which has failed to comply with the provisions of this division or any order or previous permit issued hereunder unless such user files with it a satisfactory bond, payable to the city, in a sum not to exceed a value determined by the utilities director to be necessary to achieve consistent compliance. 
                  (b)  Liability insurance. The utilities director may decline to reissue a permit to any industrial user which has failed to comply with the provisions of this division or any order or previous permit issued hereunder, unless the industrial user first submits proof that it has obtained financial assurances sufficient to restore or repair POTW damage caused by its discharge. 
                  (c)  Water supply severance. Whenever an industrial user has been found after a hearing, to be in violation of the provisions of this division or an order issued hereunder, water service to the industrial user may be severed and service will only recommence, at the user's expense, after it has satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply.

                  Sec. 90-262. - Affirmative defenses. 
                  (a)  Treatment upsets. 
                  (1)  For the purposes of this division, the term "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventative maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
                  (2)  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection (a)(3) of this section are met. 
                  (3)  A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
                  a.  An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause of the upset; 
                  b.  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 
                  c.  The user has submitted the following information to the utilities director within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset, if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days: 
                  1.  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
                  2.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
                  3.  Steps being taken and the plan to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
                  (4)  In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
                  (5)  Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
                  (6)  Users shall control production of all discharges, to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. 
                  (b)  Treatment bypasses. 
                  (1)  For the purposes of this division: 
                  a.  The term "bypass" means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a user's treatment facility. 
                  b.  The term "severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
                  (2)  A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to ensure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsection (b)(3) and (4) of this section. 
                  (3)  Need for bypass known in advance. 
                  a.  If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the utilities director, at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
                  b.  A user shall submit oral notice to the utilities director of an anticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The utilities director may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours. 
                  (4)  A bypass is prohibited, and the utilities director may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless: 
                  a.  The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
                  b.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance; 
                  c.  The user submitted notices as required under subsection (b)(3) of this section; and 
                  d.  The utilities director may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the utilities director determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in this subsection (b)(4). 
                  (c)  Prohibited discharge standards. A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in section 90-256 or the specific prohibitions in subsections 90-256(d)(1)—(13), if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause passthrough or interference and that either: 
                  (1)  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the passthrough or interference; or 
                  (2)  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.

                  (a)  The customer rates for all classifications of firm natural gas customers are based upon the city's paying a commodity charge to the natural gas supplier. Under applicable federal statutes and regulations; namely the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's Regulation section 154.38(d)(4), regulations under the Natural Gas Act and section 282.601 of the regulations under the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, the commodity charges imposed upon the city by the supplier have been rapidly increasing and otherwise fluctuating. Such rapid product cost fluctuations make it practically impossible for the city to establish firm natural gas customer rates at realistic levels to ensure normal revenues that will cover the purchase cost of gas, distribution and transportation costs, natural gas department operating expenses, and an established margin. 
                  (b)  To provide for fluctuations in the city's cost of natural gas purchased and other costs to the city that may be incurred in the delivery of natural gas to the city gate, the rates for firm natural gas imposed upon the various classifications of natural gas customers shall be subject to a purchase gas adjustment (hereinafter called "PGA") that will be calculated in accordance with subsection (d) of this section. 
                  (c)  The PGA shall not be reflected separately on the utility customer's monthly billing. 
                  (d)  The PGA shall be supplied on a monthly basis by the Municipal Gas Authority of Georgia (MGAG) to the city. The natural gas variable rates for all classifications of firm delivery customers shall be calculated monthly and shall be equal to the cost of gas plus the PGA plus the operating expenses and the appropriate rate of return on the city's investments in the natural gas system as determined by the city council from time to time. The Municipal Gas Authority of Georgia will provide the cost of natural gas each month prior to the city's billing cycle. In establishing the PGA, all fractions of cents shall be rounded up to the nearest whole cent. 
                  (e)  The city shall have available in the office of the finance director the applicable PGA and corresponding rates for the current calendar month and for the previous 24 calendar months so that interested parties may determine fluctuations in the city's natural gas rates to all classifications of firm load customers. 
                  (f)  Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the city shall not consider any price fluctuations in its cost for propane in determining the purchase gas adjustment under this section unless the price fluctuations negatively impact the city's overall gross margin.

                  Sec. 90-347. - Discontinuance of service for failure to pay natural gas bill; reconnection charges. 
                  All natural gas charges must be promptly paid or natural gas service will be discontinued and a reconnection fee in an amount established by ordinance shall be charged for turning the natural gas service on again. In addition, the current advance natural gas service payment required shall be paid in full to the city before the city shall turn the natural gas service on again in the event of a disconnection.

                  Sec. 90-348. - Reconnection of natural gas services after business hours. 
                  In addition to the provisions of section 90-170 of this article, any person whose natural gas service has been turned off for nonpayment, or for other violation or violations of the City Code, and who requests reconnection services which must be performed after normal business hours, which are Monday—Friday 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., shall be required to sign an "after hours service agreement" with the city before the reconnection services will be performed by the city. Such agreement shall provide that the customer requesting reconnection services must pay the service agreement fee, reconnection fees, and any past due amounts by 10:00 a.m., on the next business day. In the event that the customer does not pay such amounts within such time frame in violation of the agreement, the city shall be authorized to disconnect the natural gas for such customer again, and the charges incurred for the reconnection shall be added to the customer's natural gas service account. In the event that the customer fails to pay the amounts due under the after hours service agreement prior to the deadline for payment thereof, service shall not be reinstated for the customer all amounts owed by the customer to the city in connection with the customer's natural gas service are paid in full. In the event that the original disconnection is deemed to be an error on the part of the city, the service agreement fee and the reconnection fees will be waived. The amount of the service agreement fee and reconnection fees shall be established by ordinance.

                  Sec. 90-501. - Purpose. 
                  This article shall establish the stormwater utility enterprise fund. All monies deposited into this fund shall be held in trust and expended solely for the purposes and uses set forth in this article. 
                  (Ord. No. O-10-04-13, 4-22-2010) 
                  Sec. 90-502. - Findings of fact. 
                  The mayor and city council make the following findings of fact: 
                  (1)  The City of Americus is authorized by the Georgia Constitution of 1983, including, without limitation, Article IX, Section II, Paragraphs I and III thereof and O.C.G.A. § 36-82-62 to provide stormwater management services systems and facilities throughout the corporate boundaries of the City of Americus (hereinafter "the city" or "Americus") and to collect fees for provision of those services. 
                  (2)  In promulgating the regulations contained in this section, Americus is acting pursuant to authority granted by the Constitution and laws of the State of Georgia and its City Charter to provide for stormwater collection and disposal. A system for the collection, conveyance, storage, treatment and disposal of stormwater provides services to all properties within the city limits. 
                  (3)  Failure to effectively manage stormwater runoff: 
                  a.  May cause erosion of lands, threaten businesses and residences, and other facilities with water damage and may environmentally impair the rivers, streams and other bodies of water within, and downstream of, the city. 
                  b.  Failure to effectively manage stormwater can adversely affect the operations of the sanitary sewer system operated by the city thereby increasing the likelihood of infiltration and inflow into the sanitary sewer system. 
                  c.  Failure to effectively manage stormwater contributes to the potential degradation of the quality of both surface water and groundwater resources. 
                  (4)  The city presently owns and operates stormwater management systems and facilities, which have been developed over many years. The future usefulness and operational function of the existing stormwater management systems and facilities owned and operated by the city, and the additions and improvements thereto, rests on the ability of the city to effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use, and enhance stormwater systems and facilities within the city in concert with the management of other water resources within the city. In order to do so, the city must have both a comprehensive stormwater management program as well as an adequate and stable funding source for its comprehensive program operation and drainage-related capital improvement needs. 
                  (5)  The city desires to provide enhanced management of stormwater runoff quality and quantity to mitigate the impacts of pollution and flooding which may impact the public municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4), private property and downstream receiving waters of the State of Georgia and/or United States. Therefore, it is appropriate for the city to establish a stormwater utility and impose a stormwater user fee charge upon all improved properties that may discharge, directly or indirectly, into the public MS4 and stormwater conveyance system, whether the property is private or public in nature. 
                  (6)  Compliance with applicable regulatory obligations, including but not limited to, the city's NPDES wastewater discharge permit, the comprehensive plan and the city's watershed protection plan as well as other identified stormwater management program needs will affect the cost of providing stormwater management services, systems and facilities above what is currently being spent for stormwater quality management, drainage system maintenance, floodplain management, capital drainage projects and other program activities. 
                  (7)  The cost of operating and maintaining the city's stormwater management system and the funding of necessary repairs, replacements, improvements and extensions thereof should, to the extent practicable, be allocated in relationship to the services received from the city's stormwater management program and the demand imposed by improved property on the city's drainage system and stormwater management program. 
                  (8)  The professional engineering and financing analysis and related documents prepared by the city's consulting stormwater engineer properly assesses and defines the city's stormwater management program problems, needs, goals, priorities as well as the stormwater management program funding strategy. 
                  (9)  Given the stormwater management program problems, needs, goals, priorities and funding strategy identified in the aforementioned professional engineering and financing analysis, it is appropriate to authorize the formation of an organizational and accounting entity dedicated specifically to the management, maintenance, protection, control, regulation, use, and enhancement of stormwater management services, systems and facilities within the city in concert with other water resource management programs. 
                  (10)  Stormwater management is applicable and needed throughout the incorporated areas of the city. While specific service and facility demands may differ from area to area at any given point in time, a stormwater management system and service area encompassing all lands and waterbodies within the incorporated areas of the city is consistent with the present and future needs of the city. 
                  (11)  The stormwater management services rendered may differ depending on many factors and considerations, including but not limited to, location, demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater management systems and programs, and risk exposure. It is practical and equitable to allocate the cost of stormwater management among the owners and/or tenants of improved properties in proportion to the demands the properties impose on the city's stormwater management systems and facilities which result in services to such properties and the owners and/or tenants thereof. The fair and equitable apportionment of costs via the stormwater user fee charge should correlate to the stormwater management services provided to that property and the runoff demand that the property imposes on the public drainage system and the city stormwater management program. 
                  (12)  The stormwater management needs in the city include, but are not limited to, protection of the public health, safety and welfare of the community. Provision of stormwater management services renders and/or results in both a service to customers and at least some benefit to all properties, property owners, citizens and residents of the city in a variety of ways although the benefits may be indirect or immeasurable. 
                  (13)  A stormwater management program provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering stormwater management services throughout the city, and the most equitable means to implement an enhanced level of service for stormwater management within the city through stormwater user fees, development permits and inspection fees, and other mechanisms. 
                  (14)  The presence and amount of impervious surfaces on each improved property is the most important factor influencing the cost of the stormwater management services provided by the city, or to be provided by the city in the future, to that property such that the amount of impervious surface on each property is therefore the most appropriate parameter for calculating a periodic stormwater user fee charge. Therefore, the city deems it appropriate to impose a stormwater user fee charge upon all improved properties that may discharge, directly or indirectly, into the public drainage system whether the property is private or public in nature. 
                  (15)  A schedule of stormwater utility user fee charges based primarily on the amount of impervious surface located on each improved property is the most appropriate and equitable means of allocating the cost of stormwater management services throughout the city. Stormwater utility user fee charges may be designed with specific modifiers to further enhance customer equity, as well as customer understanding of the user fee charge rate structure, while at the same time minimizing the city's customer account management and maintenance efforts. 
                  (16)  Stormwater utility user fee charges may be supplemented by other funding which addresses specific needs, including, but not limited to, special district service fees, special assessments, revenue bonds, use of proceeds from special purpose local option sales taxes (SPLOST) and other forms of revenue, as, from time to time, deemed appropriate by the mayor and city council. 
                  (17)  The existence of privately owned and maintained on-site stormwater control facilities, activities or assets which reduce, or otherwise mitigate, the impact of a particular property on the city's stormwater management program, and the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and/or stormwater management systems and facilities, should be taken into account to reduce the user fee charge on that property either in the form of a credit, and such credit should be conditioned upon continuing provision of such services, systems, facilities, activities or assets in a manner complying with the standards and codes as determined by the stormwater utility. Credits for privately owned and maintained stormwater management systems, facilities, activities or assets shall be generally proportional to the affect that such systems have on the reduction and mitigation of the stormwater runoff impacts from the property. 
                  (18)  It is imperative that the proceeds from all user fee charges for stormwater management services, systems or facilities, together with any other supplemental revenues raised or otherwise allocated specifically to stormwater management services, systems or facilities, be dedicated solely to those purposes, and such proceeds of user fee charges and supplemental revenues shall therefore be deposited into the City of Americus Stormwater Utility Enterprise Fund and shall remain in that fund. In trust, to be dispersed only for stormwater management capital improvements, facilities, and equipment, operating and nonoperating costs, lease payments and debt service of bonds or other indebtedness for stormwater management purposes. 
                  (19)  In order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public, the governing authority of Americus hereby exercises its authority to establish a stormwater utility enterprise fund, as the best available means of addressing the foregoing needs and legal requirements. By means of a separate stormwater utility rate ordinance, the city will enact a stormwater user fee rate structure in the future to establish stormwater utility user fee charge rates for the provision of stormwater management services.

                  Sec. 90-503. - Definitions. 
                  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Act means and refers to the Clean Water Act as amended by the Water Quality Act of 1987 (33 U.S.C. § 1251 et seq.), as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency pursuant thereto. 
                  Customers of the stormwater utility shall include all persons, properties, and entities serviced by and/or benefiting from the services provided by the city's stormwater management program and the stormwater utility. These services include, but are not necessarily limited to, the stormwater utility's administration, management, maintenance, expansion, and improvement of the stormwater management systems for the handling and disposal of stormwater runoff from private and public properties, and the regulation of the public and private stormwater management systems, controls, facilities and activities. 
                  Hydrologic response defines the manner and means whereby stormwater collects, remains, infiltrates, and is conveyed from a property. Hydrologic response is dependent on several factors including, but not limited to, the presence of impervious surface, the parcel's size, the parcel's shape, the parcel's topography, the parcel's vegetative canopy, the parcel's groundwater characteristics, the parcel's on-site operations, the parcel's stormwater controls, the parcel's antecedent moisture as well as the parcel's geologic and hydro-geologic characteristics. 
                  Impervious area shall mean and have the same definition as impervious surface. 
                  Impervious surface means those areas which prevent or impede the infiltration of stormwater into the soil in the manner in which it entered the soil, in natural conditions, prior to development and causes stormwater runoff to collect, concentrate or flow in a manner materially different from what would occur if the land were in an unaltered natural condition. Common impervious surfaces include, but are not limited to, rooftops, buildings or structures, sidewalks, walkways, patio areas, driveways, parking lots, storage areas, awnings and other fabric or plastic coverings, and other surfaces such as compacted soil and gravel, which prevent or impede the natural infiltration of stormwater runoff which existed prior to development. 
                  Improved property (or developed property) means property altered from its natural state by construction or installation of more than 500 square feet of impervious surfaces. 
                  Service area means the entire land area within the corporate limits of the city. 
                  Single-family residential property (or SFR) means developed property containing one residential structure with no more than two dwelling units in or attached thereto, situated upon a single lot of record. Improved property may be classified as SFR even if supplemental accessory structures are present such as garages, carports, storage buildings, guesthouses, servants or caretakers quarters, cottages or barns, or the presence of a commercial use within the residence, as long as such use does not result in significant additional amounts of impervious surfaces. SFR properties shall not include improved property containing structures used primarily for nonresidential purposes; manufactured homes located within manufactured home parks where the land is owned by someone other than the owners of the manufactured homes; residential condominium developments with more than two units; or vacant/undeveloped property. 
                  Stormwater management services mean all services provided by the city which relate to the: 
                  (1)  Transfer, control, conveyance or movement of stormwater runoff through the incorporated portions of the city; 
                  (2)  Maintenance, repair and replacement of existing stormwater management systems and facilities; 
                  (3)  Planning, development, design and construction of additional stormwater management systems and facilities to meet current and anticipated needs; 
                  (4)  Regulation of the use of stormwater management services, systems and facilities; and 
                  (5)  Compliance with applicable state and federal stormwater management regulations and permit requirements. 
                  Stormwater management services may address the quality of stormwater runoff as well as the quantity thereof. 
                  Stormwater management systems and facilities mean those natural and manmade channels, swales, ditches, rivers, streams, creeks, branches, reservoirs, ponds, drainage ways, inlets, catch basins, pipes, headwalls, storm sewers, lakes and other physical works, properties and improvements which transfer, control, convey, detain, retain, treat or otherwise influence the movement of stormwater runoff. 
                  Stormwater user fee charge means the periodic user fee charge for the provision of stormwater management services imposed pursuant to this article of the Americus Stormwater Utility Enterprise Fund Ordinance and applicable sections of the Americus Stormwater Utility Rate Ordinance. This term shall exclude special charges to the owners and/or tenants of particular properties for services, systems or facilities related to stormwater management, including, but not limited to, charges for development plan review, inspection of development projects, post-construction maintenance and inspection of existing facilities, on-site stormwater control systems and other stormwater management related services provided by Americus for which a corresponding fee is collected for the service rendered.

                  Sec. 90-508. - Enforcement methods and inspections. 
                  (a)  It shall be the duty of all property owners and/or tenants of improved real property within the incorporated area of the city to provide, manage, maintain, and operate on-site stormwater management systems sufficient to collect, convey, detain, and/or discharge stormwater runoff in a safe manner consistent with all applicable federal and state laws, regulations, city development regulations, and other pertinent ordinances. Any failure to meet this obligation shall constitute a violation of this article and be subject to citation and prosecution in the Americus Municipal Court. Each day such violation exists shall constitute a separate offense. 
                  (b)  Alternately, in the event a public nuisance is deemed to exist by the mayor and city council, the city may elect to sue in municipal court to abate such nuisance. In the event a public nuisance is found by the court to exist, which the property owner and/or tenant fails to abate within such reasonable time as allowed by the Americus Municipal Court, the court, by judgment, may allow the city to enter upon the real property and cause work as is reasonably necessary to be performed, with the actual cost thereof assessed against the property by filing a lien. From date of filing of such abatement action, the city shall have lien rights which may be perfected, after judgment, by filing a notice of lis pendens on the general execution docket of the Sumter County Superior Court. 
                  (c)  The city shall have the right for its employees or designated agents to enter upon public and private property during reasonable hours, and after reasonable notice to the owner and/or tenant thereof, in order to assure compliance with the provisions of this article, and state and federal law.

                  Sec. 90-602. - Definitions. 
                  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Credit means a reduction in the amount of a customer's stormwater user fee charge in recognition of a customer's efforts to mitigate the stormwater runoff impact that developed property has on the city stormwater management services and systems, and/or the efforts of a customer to offset the city's cost for implementation of stormwater management program (SWMP) activities such as public education, watershed stewardship, etc. 
                  Dwelling unit shall mean a structure, regardless of the type or method of construction, which contains one or more bedrooms, a bathroom, and cooking facilities, designed for occupancy by one or more person(s) regardless of relationship, living as a single-family unit. 
                  Equivalent residential unit (ERU) means the stormwater user fee charge billing unit increment related to the median horizontal impervious surface area footprint of 3,000 square feet for a typical single-family dwelling unit within the city. 
                  Manufactured home park means a common development (with a single property owner or entity) of more than one factory-built or prefabricated housing structures that have been partially or entirely assembled at another location and moved into the development. 
                  Nonsingle family residential (NSFR) customer shall mean a utility customer whose property meets the definition of NSFR whether such customer is the owner of the parcel or a tenant of the owner. 
                  Nonsingle family residential (NSFR) property shall mean a developed parcel of land that consists of various nonresidential land uses including, but not limited to: (1) multifamily, commercial (including mixed commercial and residential), office/institutional, public, transportation, industrial, manufacturing and storage buildings and facilities; (2) parking lots, parks, public and private schools, universities and hospitals; (3) streets, roads, water and wastewater treatment plants; and (4) any other form of use not specifically defined as a single-family residential property (SFR). 
                  Single-family residential (SFR) customer means a utility customer of the city residing in a dwelling unit whether such customer is the owner of the dwelling unit, a tenant of the owner of the dwelling unit, or a resident of the dwelling unit. 
                  Single-family residential (SFR) property means developed property containing one residential structure with no more than two dwelling units in or attached thereto, situated upon a single lot of record. Improved property may be classified as SFR even if supplemental accessory structures are present such as garages, carports, storage buildings, guesthouses, servants or caretakers quarters, cottages or barns, or the presence of a commercial use within the residence, as long as such use does not result in significant additional amounts of impervious surfaces, as determined by the governing body or its designee. SFR properties shall not include improved property containing structures used primarily for nonresidential purposes and as defined herein; manufactured homes located within manufactured home parks where the land is owned by someone other than the owners of the manufactured homes; residential condominium developments with more than two units; or vacant/undeveloped property. 
                  Unless otherwise defined within this article, the definitions included in the stormwater utility enterprise fund ordinance (Code section 90-501 et seq.) are adopted herein by reference.

                  Sec. 90-603. - Stormwater utility customer classes. 
                  (a)  The stormwater utility shall establish specified customer classes within the service area to reflect differences in impervious surface and stormwater runoff characteristics; stormwater management program services provided by the city to the stormwater utility customers; and the respective demand that those customers' properties place on the city SWMP and drainage system components. All state, federal, and county developed properties are subject to the user fee charges on the same basis as private properties. The stormwater utility classes will encompass all developed and undeveloped properties within the city and are defined as follows: 
                  (1)  The single-family residential (SFR) class shall consist of all developed properties classified as SFR customers per the applicable definition. 
                  (2)  The nonsingle-family residential (NSFR) class shall consist of all developed properties classified as NSFR customers per the applicable definition. 
                  (3)  The undeveloped class shall consist of properties classified as undeveloped per the applicable definition. 
                  (b)  Documentation pertaining to the stormwater utility customer classes shall be kept on file in the office of the stormwater utility manager for public inspection.

                  Sec. 90-604. - Stormwater user fee charge rates. 
                  (a)  The stormwater utility shall impose a stormwater user fee on all developed properties within the service area in a fair and equitable manner. The stormwater utility shall apportion the cost of delivering stormwater services to all developed properties based on the demand the property places on the city's stormwater management program and the stormwater services provided by the city. 
                  (b)  Stormwater user fee charge rates shall be set and may be modified from time to time by the governing body of the city. A schedule of said rates shall be on file in the Office of the City Clerk of Americus. In setting or modifying such rates, it shall be the goal of the city to establish rates that are fair, equitable and reasonable, and together with other funding sources available to the Americus Stormwater Utility for services, systems, and/or facilities related to stormwater management (e.g., credit application fees, plan review fees, development inspection fees, regulatory compliance inspection fees and other fees related to provision of stormwater management services), are sufficient to support the cost of the stormwater management program, including but not limited to, the payment of principal and interest on debt obligations, lease payments, operating expenses, capital outlays, non-operating expenses, provisions for prudent reserves and other costs as deemed appropriate by the city. 
                  (c)  The basis for calculation of the stormwater user fee charge to all developed property within the city is established in this article. The city shall assign or determine the customer class, amount of impervious area and other pertinent factors as may be needed for the fair, reasonable and equitable allocation of the costs to deliver stormwater management services and to calculate the stormwater user fee charges for all developed properties in the city. 
                  (d)  Stormwater user fee charges shall be based upon the total number of equivalent residential units (ERUs) associated with developed properties within the city. Each ERU shall correspond to 3,000 square feet of impervious surface. Gravel and compacted soil driveways, parking areas, and roads on private property will be considered impervious surface and included in the customer's ERU calculation because of the hydrologic response characteristics of these materials. However, the total surface area associated with these materials will be calculated at 85 percent of the total ERUs to reflect the hydrologic response characteristics of these materials. Application of the 85 percent factor to these materials is based on applicable literature sources and reference documents outlined herein. 
                  (e)  Calculation of charges. The periodic stormwater user fee charges imposed on all developed properties shall be $4.00 multiplied by the number of ERUs for each customer account. 
                  (1)  The number of ERUs that will be utilized to calculate the user fee charge shall be in general accordance with the following: 
                  a.  SFR customer class: Each SFR customer account shall be charged 1.0 ERU per month unless one of the conditions outlined below applies. 
                  1.  If two customer accounts are assigned to a SFR property (i.e., a duplex) then each customer account on that parcel will be charged 0.5 ERU per month for billing purposes. 
                  2.  The minimum stormwater user fee charge amount to any eligible customer will be $2.00/ERU/month. 
                  3.  If the SFR property has an impervious surface amount that exceeds 9,000 square feet (or three ERUs) then a customer stormwater user fee bill will be calculated for the customer account using the NSFR user fee charge calculation approach outlined herein. 
                  b.  NSFR customer class: Each NSFR customer shall be charged one ERU for each 3,000 square feet, or increment thereof, of impervious surface located on the property to establish the total number of ERUs for billing. Fractional ERUs will be rounded to one decimal place to establish the number of ERUs for billing each month. 
                  c.  Undeveloped land customer class: Undeveloped land shall be assigned zero ERUs and will not receive a stormwater user fee bill. 
                  (f)  Stormwater user fee charges shall be billed on the customer's monthly public utility bill (except as stipulated below) starting with the first billing cycle in June 2010 as provided in this article and the stormwater utility enterprise fund ordinance. 
                  (1)  Customers that do not receive a monthly public utility bill from the city shall be billed for stormwater services via another method and frequency established by the city. 
                  (2)  The property owner will be charged for the total impervious surface for residential customer accounts that are part of a larger common development such as multifamily complexes. 
                  (3)  The city shall bill the property owner's tenant for the stormwater user fee charge in situations where the tenant has opened an account with the city for public utility services (i.e., water, sewer, and/or sanitation); provided, however, the property owner shall remain ultimately liable for payment of the stormwater user fee charge imposed on the property. The city shall be authorized to bill the landlord or property owner for stormwater services where accurate and equitable apportionment of the user fee charges to multiple accounts on a site is not practical as determined by the city, and/or to facilitate efficient billing and collection of customer user fee charges.

                  (a)  Except as provided in this section or otherwise provided by law, no developed public or private property located in the incorporated area of the city shall be exempt from the stormwater user fee charges. The stormwater utility user fee charge is not a tax and no exception, credit, offset, or other reduction in stormwater user fee charges shall be granted based on age, tax status, economic status, race, religion, disability, or other condition unrelated to the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management program services and facilities. 
                  (b)  Exemptions to the stormwater user fee charges are as follows: 
                  (1)  Parcels which contain 500 square feet, or less, of impervious surfaces shall be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. 
                  (2)  Linear railroad rights-of-way (i.e., tracks, rails, roadbed) outside of the defined yard limits shall be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. This exemption is in recognition of routine drainage system maintenance and capital construction activities undertaken by the railroad company associated with rights-of-way and drainage conveyance systems. However, railroad stations, rail yards, maintenance buildings, and/or other improved property used for railroad operations shall not be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. 
                  (3)  Sumter County roads and rights-of-way located within the city limits shall be exempt from stormwater user fee charges in situations where Sumter County has legal responsibility to perform all drainage system maintenance and capital construction activities with respect to such roads and rights-of-way. This exemption is in recognition of the drainage system maintenance and capital construction responsibilities undertaken by Sumter County as required in the service delivery strategy dated September 23, 1999. The list of county roads that are exempt from the user fee charges are listed in the service delivery strategy dated September 23, 1999. All other developed property owned by Sumter County shall be subject to the imposition of stormwater user fee charges in accordance with this article. 
                  (4)  Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) roads and rights-of-way shall be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. This exemption is in recognition of routine drainage system maintenance and capital construction activities undertaken by GDOT in association with GDOT rights-of-way road and drainage conveyance systems. However, maintenance buildings and/or other developed property used for GDOT purposes shall not be exempt from stormwater user fee charges.

Copies of the credit manual will be maintained by and made available from the stormwater utility manager. 
                  (1)  Customers may apply for credits and/or adjustments in accordance with the credit manual. 
                  (2)  A stormwater user fee charge credit shall be determined based on the technical requirements, standards and criteria contained in the credit manual. The amount of credit, or reduction of the stormwater user fee charge, shall be in accordance with the criteria contained in the credit manual. 
                  (3)  Any credit allowed against the stormwater user fee charge is conditioned on continuing compliance with the city's design and performance standards as stated in the credit manual and upon continuing provision of the controls, systems, facilities, services, and activities provided, operated, and maintained by the customer. The stormwater utility manager may revoke a credit at any time for noncompliance with applicable standards and criteria as established in the credit manual or this article. 
                  (4)  In order to obtain a credit, the customer must make application to the city on forms provided by the stormwater utility manager for such purpose, and in accordance with the procedures outlined in the credit manual. 
                  (5)  The application for any credit or adjustment must be in writing and must include the information necessary to establish eligibility for the credit or adjustment, and be in the format described in the credit manual. The customer's public utility account must be paid and current prior to review and approval of a stormwater utility credit application by the city. Incomplete applications will not be accepted for consideration and processing. 
                  (b)  When an application for a credit is deemed complete by the stormwater utility manager, he shall have 30 days from the date the complete application is received to approve the credit in whole, approve the credit in part, or deny the credit.

                  Sec. 90-650. - Design of pretreatment system. 
                  Oil water separators, grease traps, and sand traps will be required for commercial and industrial establishments as a pretreatment system where it is determined by the city that they are necessary to prevent oil and grease waste discharge to the sanitary sewer system in quantities that may adversely affect the operation of the sewer system. The user shall submit plans to the city for review and comment. The installation shall be subject to the city's inspection prior to placing in service. 
                  (1)  All subsurface pretreatment systems must comply with the engineering standards indicated on the standard detail, as well as the current plumbing code used by the city. 
                  (2)  For the sizing of pretreatment systems by specific generators source the following calculations are required to be submitted by a licensed engineer or master plumber: 
                  a.  Restaurant facilities:

                  (S) = AREA / 15 - Square footage of designated food space - Factor to be used to calculate seating capacity 
                  (S) × (GM) × (2.5) × (LF) = Grease Interceptor capacity in gallons. 
                  Example: A grocery store is 69,000 sq.ft. An area of 4,000 sq. ft., is designated for their food court area. 
                  4,000 / 15 = 266.6 (267) Seating Capacity 
                  (267) × (5) × (2.5) × (1.0) = 3,338 / 1,500 = 2.2 
                  (2) 1,500 grease interceptors needed 
                  Grocery stores will have a minimum (1) 1,500 grease trap. If additional eating facilities will be located in store similar to a food court area, store will be sized based on square footage of food area and seating capacity. Individual restaurants may be required to install pretreatment for their space. 
                  (3)  Systems currently installed will not change unless the pretreatment system is found to be: 
                  a.  Inadequate for the facility's current operation. 
                  b.  In violation due to a commercial waste generator failing to provide documentation for maintenance of the current system and an inspection reveals an upgrade or repair is required. 
                  c.  Located in a spill area and the commercial waste generator has failed to maintain the pretreatment system, which results in a fine from the city or clean-up is required and an inspection reveals the current system is inadequate or in need of repair. 
                  d.  Installed incorrectly and not per plumbing code used by the city or engineering standards. The existing system shall be corrected where possible. If unable to correct, then the system must be replaced. 
                  (4)  Subsurface pretreatment systems will have manhole covers over the inlet and outlet of the system. The concrete lid of tank will have circular openings for the placement of manhole covers. The manhole covers must be at least two feet in diameter. All openings on the pretreatment system will be core drilled. 
                  (5)  Any 3,000-gallon pretreatment system can be installed in two sections provided the center section has been sealed properly where no leakage can occur. The maximum size for any single tank installation will be 3,000 gallons on commercial sites where a greater system is not required for spill containment. All 3,000-gallon tanks shall have a minimum of two manhole openings for access to the tanks for cleaning and inspection. The subsurface pretreatment system will be made of prefab concrete tanks or its equivalent and will be a solid continuous structure where no sealing or binding of the middle section of the tank is allowed. The tank cannot be fabricated in two sections on tanks less than 1,500 gallons. A baffle wall is required in the tanks and the baffle wall must be fabricated as a permanent fixture. A slide structure will not be allowed as a baffle wall. A three-inch to five-inch diameter hole in the baffle wall must have a PVC elbow pipe turned down a maximum two feet from the bottom of the tank. 
                  (6)  A subsurface pretreatment system will have a standard manhole suitable for observation, sampling and measurement of wastewater. This manhole shall be installed at the user's expense and shall be maintained to be safe and accessible to the city at all times. This manhole is called the test manhole and is considered part of the overall pretreatment system. 
                  (7)  Subsurface pretreatment systems installed must be certified as a grease trap or an oil water separator. A septic system will not be allowed in lieu of the required pretreatment system. Interior pretreatment systems must have PDI certification (or certification approved by the public works department) and the gallon (GMP) capacity must be labeled on the unit. To verify type and size of tank purchased, an inspector can request a copy of the invoice for the pretreatment system installed. 
                  (8)  All pretreatment systems that are subsurface will be brought to finished grade using pre-cast concrete cones. Brick work will also be allowed if the depth is no more than four feet to reach grade. The depth of the pretreatment system will determine how the brick work should be built. The standard core hole in the top of a pre-cast pretreatment system lid is two feet. The brick work will be three feet in diameter around the core opening. The three-foot base will allow entry to the pretreatment system for maintenance. When using bricks, once 80 percent of the height has been achieved to the two-foot manhole opening, you must corbel in the brickwork in small increments. 
                  (9)  An alternative interior pretreatment system shall be used only after evaluation and authorization by the city. Any alternative pretreatment system unit authorized by the city for use must have product support for maintenance and operation of the system. The equipment must be available for sale and the supply must be readily available for installation. The use of an alternative system will require established procedures for routine maintenance, operational surveillance, and environmental monitoring to assure the system continues to function properly. Any fees incurred for quality assurance of this unit will be the total responsibility of the commercial waste generator. The sizing of the grease trap will be based on the manufacturer's recommendations, but it must be equivalent to a subsurface pretreatment system gallon capacity where required. 
                  (10)  A grease trap is used for the collection of kitchen waste discharge only. No can wash areas, no dumpster, no mop sinks, no food grinders and no floor drains in mechanical rooms, bathrooms, or discharge from food coolers. Commercial waste generators that have micro-brewery facilities may be subject to additional discharge requirements. 
                  (11)  Installation of a mechanical system to continuously or intermittently apply solutions of enzymes, special bacteria or other agents to the sewer shall not be allowed in lieu of an acceptable pretreatment system. 
                  (12)  It shall constitute a violation of this article to introduce chemicals, acidic or caustic substances which emulsify or otherwise temporarily dissolve fats, oils and grease to the extent that it later solidifies in the city sewer lines. If a commercial waste generator uses enzymes and bacteria for pretreatment maintenance and it is discovered that said substances causes damage to or interferes with the operation or maintenance of the sewer system, creates a public nuisance or odor, or presents a potential health hazard, then these additives will be prohibited. Use of any other substances, including special enzymes and bacteria is solely at the discretion of the commercial waste generator. 
                  (13)  Grit, sand traps and oil water separators shall be installed in accordance with the current official plumbing code used by the city engineering standards. 
                  (14)  Any strip retail shopping center or office building showing subsurface pretreatment systems at designated buildings or structures will only be allowed discharge by a single tenant or food service to that system. No multiple users will be allowed. The only exception to this condition is a shopping mall with a food court where pretreatment systems are installed and maintained by the mall corporation or management leasing.

                  (a)  Pretreatment systems shall be maintained by the commercial waste generator at their expense, to assure continually efficient operation at all times. The commercial waste generator shall maintain records of said service and make available all records to the city upon request. The commercial waste generator must service their pretreatment system frequently or repair their system to maintain the following: 
                  (1)  A 25-percent tank retention capacity rule (the 25 percent rule requires that the depth of oil and grease (floating and settled) in a trap shall not be equal to or greater than 25 percent of the total operating depth of the trap. The operating depth of the trap is determined by measuring the internal depth of the tank. If the tank is measured with more than two feet of floating top solids or more than two feet of settled solids, the tank is in violation). 
                  (2)  A top sludge cap less than two feet in tank. 
                  (3)  A suspended solids content of less than two feet on the bottom of tank. 
                  (4)  A pretreatment system able to maintain a daily discharge limit of 250 mg/l to sanitary sewer. 
                  (5)  A pretreatment system where no sludge deposits of grease or oil waste accumulate in a test manhole or create a grease/oil waste stream to the sanitary sewer. 
                  (6)  A pretreatment system that does not create any obnoxious odors and poses no threat to public health and welfare. 
                  (7)  A pretreatment system that does not cause back-ups to kitchen sinks or any interior kitchen or building plumbing. 
                  (8)  A pretreatment system that causes no manhole overflows no accumulation of oil/grease in the city sanitary sewer system. 
                  (b)  The following maintenance schedule shall be required for pretreatment systems operating in the city; however, commercial pretreatment inspectors shall have the authority to adjust any facility's maintenance schedule if upon inspection it is determined the maintenance schedule of the pretreatment system is not controlling the discharge of grease/oil waste to the sanitary sewer: 
                  (1)  Subsurface systems (grease trap, oil water separator, sand trap): 
                  Gallon Capacity Maintenance Required Time Period 

                   
                  (2)  Interior systems (grease trap, oil separator, sand trap): 
                  40 lb.—50 lb. Total Pump out—Monthly. 
                  70 lb.—200 lb. Total Pump out—Every 3 months.

                  Check system weekly—Every three months to make sure system is operating correctly. 
                  (c)  New commercial waste generators that are permitted for new pretreatment installation shall be required to provide the city with a notarized statement for the maintenance of their pretreatment system based on the maintenance schedule stated in this article. 
                  (d)  Commercial waste generators located in an area that have experienced a spill where a city sanitary sewer system has been impacted or a manhole has overflowed due to grease/oil accumulation must provide the city with a maintenance schedule to prevent this from occurring again. If the maintenance schedule is found to be inadequate or does not adhere to the maintenance schedule required by the city for that specific pretreatment system, the city shall have the right to amend that commercial waste generators' maintenance schedule to control any further commercial waste discharge that could impact the sanitary sewer system, manhole or pretreatment system. 
                  (e)  Any commercial waste generator(s) found to be in violation for failure to maintain their pretreatment system in a spill area shall be assessed one-half the cost for clean-up and/or fined by the city due to commercial waste impacting the environment or sanitary sewer system. Additional fines may be imposed by the state. 
                  (f)  Any commercial waste generator found not adhering to any maintenance standards as established by this article will be in violation. 
                  (g)  Any commercial waste generator requesting a deviation from a pretreatment system maintenance schedule as stated in this article shall submit their request in writing. The written request must include documentation that verifies that the pretreatment system has been operating in accordance with this article for a year and the modification of the maintenance schedule will not change the compliance status of the pretreatment system. 
                  (h)  A commercial waste generator who operates a food service in their establishment, but the food service is not considered their main business income may be required to cease their food operation if they violate any parts of this article and may be assessed a sewer surcharge fee for the cost of additional sewer collection system frequency and magnitude of cleaning that may be required as determined by the utilities director to prevent stoppages or backups due to commercial waste generators where a required upgrade, repair, or installation of a pretreatment system is not completed and/or a subsurface system is not possible pursuant to the requirements of this article. Once the generator has come into compliance the food service operation can resume.

                  (a)  This chapter, including the zoning map, may be amended from time to time, but no amendment shall become effective unless it shall have been proposed by or shall first have been submitted to the planning commission for review and recommendation. A property owner shall not initiate action for a zoning amendment affecting the same parcel more often than once every 12 months. The planning commission shall have 30 days within which to submit its report. If the planning commission fails to submit a report within the 30-day period, it shall be deemed to have approved the proposed amendment. 
                  (b)  Such person as may desire an amendment of this chapter by changing the zoning classification of property from one type of district to another shall: 
                  (1)  File a request in writing with the city's community development department with fee attached in the amount established by ordinance, setting forth in detail the desired amendment and describing by address or location of property to be reclassified, and the name or names of the legal owner or owners thereof. 
                  (2)  Such request shall have attached thereto three plats of survey prepared by a registered or certified engineer or land surveyor setting forth in detail the property described in the request, and showing further the present zoning designation, the requested zoning designation, and the zoning designation of all property abutting the subject property. 
                  (3)  The community development director or designee shall date stamp the request immediately upon receipt and shall direct the property owner to pay the filing fee to the finance director's office. The community development director or designee shall schedule the request for a hearing before the planning commission at the commission's next regular meeting, so long as the next regular meeting of the commission is more than one week from the date of filing. In the event that the rezoning request is filed less than one week prior to the next meeting of the planning commission, the community development director or designee shall be authorized, if said director or designee is unable to complete the necessary preliminary work on the rezoning request prior to the next commission meeting, to schedule the hearing for the next commission meeting after such director or designee anticipates having the preliminary work completed on the rezoning request. 
                  (4)  The recommendation of the planning commission shall be noted in the minutes of the commission meeting, and a copy of the minutes, along with a copy of the plat of survey filed with the rezoning request, shall be filed in the office of the city clerk. 
                  (5)  The community development director or designee shall notify in writing the city council of the action of the planning commission.

                  Sec. 94-54. - Public hearing and procedures therefor. 
                  (a)  Before enacting an amendment to this chapter, the city council shall hold a public hearing thereon. At least 15, but not more than 45 days prior to the date of the hearing, the city council shall cause to be published within a newspaper of general circulation within the territorial boundaries of the local government a notice of the hearing. The notice shall state the time, place and purpose of the hearing. If the hearing concerns a proposed amendment to the official zoning map, then the notice shall also state, the location of the property, the present zoning classification and the proposed zoning classification. 
                  (b)  Whenever a proposed amendment to this chapter involves changing the zoning classification of property from one type of district to another, the building official shall cause to have posted in a conspicuous place on said property one or more signs, each of which shall be a two-sided sign which shall not be less than four square feet in area, and each of which shall contain information regarding the time, place, and purpose of the hearing, the present zoning classification of the property, and the proposed zoning classification of the property. Such signs shall be posted on the property for a period of not less than 15 days prior to the date of the hearing. 
                  (c)  At least 15 days prior to the date of the hearing, the city clerk shall prepare an agenda of the proposed amendments to be considered at public hearings.

                  (d)  The mayor shall conduct the public hearing and shall open the hearing at the time and place specified in the hearing notice. The mayor shall announce the rules of the hearing before proceeding with a hearing upon each proposed amendment. For each proposed amendment, the mayor shall call upon the city manager, or his designee, to present the report of the planning commission. The mayor shall then call for a show of hands of those present wishing to speak in support of the proposed amendment. The mayor shall recognize each such person in turn and ask him or her to rise, state his name and address, and present his statement. The mayor shall then call for a show of hands of those present wishing to speak in opposition to the proposed amendment. The mayor shall recognize each such person in turn and ask him to rise, state his name and address, and present his statement. Those persons wishing to speak in favor of the proposed zoning amendment and those persons wishing to speak in opposition to the proposed zoning amendment shall be allowed at least ten minutes to present such data, evidence and opinion as such respective side deems appropriate; provided, however, that if either or both sides do not desire to use the full minimum time period, then such minimum time period may be waived. The mayor shall be further authorized to grant each side such additional amount of time beyond the minimum time period set out herein, but in all events, both sides shall be given the same amount of time within which to present their side at the hearing. After all persons have been given an opportunity to speak for or against the proposed amendment, the city council shall have the right to discuss the proposed amendment and, upon completion thereof, the hearing shall be closed. Unless the city council shall give unanimous consent, of those present and voting, to render its decision at the conclusion of the public hearing, the proposed amendment shall be tabled for final consideration at the next succeeding meeting of the city council.

                  (a)  Whenever the planning commission and the city council consider an amendment to this chapter which involves changing the zoning classification of property from one type of district to another, they shall balance the interest of the community in promoting the public health, safety, morality and general welfare against the right of property owners in the use of their property. In making such zoning recommendations and decisions, the planning commission and the city council shall use the following standards, where relevant: 
                  (1)  Whether the proposed amendment would permit a use that is suitable, in view of the use and development of adjacent and nearby property; 
                  (2)  Whether the proposed amendment would likely have an adverse effect upon the existing use, usability or economic value of adjacent or nearby property; 
                  (3)  Whether the property to be affected by the proposed amendment has a reasonable economic use as currently zoned; 
                  (4)  Whether the proposed amendment would likely result in a use which would or could cause an excessive or burdensome use of existing streets, transportation facilities, utilities or schools, or would otherwise have an adverse impact upon public health, safety, morality or general welfare; 
                  (5)  In the event that the city has adopted a land use plan, whether the proposed amendment is in conformity with the policy and intent of the land use plan; 
                  (6)  Whether there are other existing or changing conditions affecting the use and development of the property that gives supporting grounds for either approval or disapproval of the proposed amendment; 
                  (7)  Whether the subject property itself is suitable for the proposed use to which it is intended to be put after being rezoned; 
                  (8)  The length of time that the subject property has been vacant as zoned, considered in the context of land development in the area in the vicinity of the property; 
                  (9)  Whether the property owner presently intends to develop the property in accord with the proposed amended zoning classification within a reasonable time after approval of the proposed amendment. 
                  (b)  The clerk shall print copies of this section of this chapter and maintain such copies at his office for distribution to the public during regular business hours.

                  (2)  Special exception . To hear and decide applications for special exceptions as specified in this chapter and for decision on any special questions upon which the board is authorized by this chapter to pass. When acting upon such application for special exception, the board shall give consideration to the following factors, where applicable: 
                  a.  The proposed design and location of the particular development. 
                  b.  The possible traffic-generating characteristics of the proposed development. 
                  c.  The effects the proposed development will have on the present or intended character of the area in which it proposes to locate. 
                  d.  The availability of public utilities, facilities and services. 
                  After such considerations, the board shall take such actions or establish such reasonable conditions, of approval, such as planted screens, as will accomplish the intents and purposes of this chapter. 
                  (3)  Variances. To authorize upon appeal in specific individual cases such variances from terms of this chapter as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this chapter will, in an individual case, result in unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of this chapter shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. Such variance may be granted in such individual case of practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship only upon a finding by the board that all of the following conditions exist: 
                  a.  There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape or topography; 
                  b.  The application of the chapter to this particular piece of property would create an unnecessary hardship;

                  e.  Denying the variance will deprive the owner of rights commonly enjoyed by other landowners; 
                  f.  Granting the variance will not bestow on the owner rights not generally enjoyed by other similar property owners in that district; 
                  g.  Granting this variance will be in harmony with the overall intent of this chapter, and will not be detrimental to the public interests; 
                  h.  The special circumstances surrounding the request for a variance are not the result of acts by the applicant; 
                  i.  The existence of nonconforming uses in this district or of similar nonconforming uses in other districts will not be considered as a basis on which to grant other variances; 
                  j.  The variance requested is the minimum variance which will permit reasonable use of the land; and 
                  k.  The variance is not a request to permit a use of land, buildings or structures that is not permitted by right or special exception in the district involved. 
                  (4)  Use variance prohibited. No variance may be taken for granted for a use of land or premises.

In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the board or by a court of record on notice to the official from whom the appeal is taken and on due cause shown.
