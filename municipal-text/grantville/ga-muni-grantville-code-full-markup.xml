PREFACE 
</p>
        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Grantville, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the Prior Code, as updated through March 14, 2011, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the Prior Code, as updated through March 14, 2011, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Jim Jenkins, Senior Code Attorney, and D. J. Heath, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Tonya Wheelus, CMC, City Clerk, for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that her efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Amendments to the Charter are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions.

For stylistic purposes, a uniform system of headings, catchlines and citations to state statutes has been used. The title, enactment, severability, repealer, transitional, ratification, publication and effective date provisions have been omitted, and where a section has been amended or repealed by a later provision, only the current language has been printed. Additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets.

                  (1)  The city is a creditor pursuant to 16 CFR 681.2 due to its provision or maintenance of covered accounts for which payment is made in arrears. Covered accounts offered to customers for the provision of city services include water, sewer, solid waste, and stormwater. 
                  (2)  The processes of opening a new covered account, restoring an existing covered account, making payments on such accounts, and making payments for property taxes and other services have been identified as potential processes in which identity theft could occur.

The applicant shall also provide any other information necessary for the department providing the service for which the covered account is created. The information shall be entered directly into the city's records system and held in a secure storage area with access limited to those city personnel with the need to know. 
                  (b)  For each customer account for which the city may now or hereafter provide individual customer access to the customer's account information, such account shall be assigned an account number and personal identification number (PIN) which shall be unique to that account.

The password shall be at least eight characters in length and shall contain letters, numbers and symbols. 
                  Sec. 2-115. - Report of unauthorized access. 
                  Any unauthorized access to or other breach of customer accounts is to be reported immediately to the appropriate department head and the password changed immediately. 
                  Sec. 2-116. - Customer information confidential; report of requests for access. 
                  Personal identifying information included in customer accounts is considered confidential and any request or demand that specifically asks for such information shall be immediately forwarded to the applicable department head or other person authorized by the city council to carry out the provisions of this article.

                  (a)  In the event that credit card payments that are made over the Internet are processed through a third-party service provider, such third-party service provider shall certify that it has an adequate identity theft prevention program in place that is applicable to such payments.

                  Editor's note— Ord. No. 04-2014, adopted February 24, 2014, set out provisions intended for use as a new article VII, §§ 2-170—2-2-176. For purposes of clarity, and at the editor's discretion, these provisions have been included as a new article IX, §§ 2-190—2-196.

                  Responsive bid or proposal means a person or entity who has submitted a bid or proposal that conforms in all material respects to the requirements set forth in the invitation for bids or request for proposals. 
                  Sealed competitive bid means a method of soliciting bids or proposals, in writing, whereby the amount of each bid or proposal remains sealed until the announced time of bid opening and at which time all bids are opened publicly and tallied.

                  The city manager, or some other employee or city official appointed by the city council shall be the city purchasing agent.

                  Sec. 2-192. - Scope of coverage. 
                  (a)  All purchasing, leasing or contracting for equipment, materials and supplies shall be governed by this article. Contracts for services, where feasible, should be competitively bid upon written specifications approved by the city manager; provided, however, it is recognized that the ability to render certain services, particularly those of learned professionals, are often unique to an individual contractor and are incapable of competitive bidding. All contracts shall be reviewed and approved by the city attorney as to legal form, approved by the city council and spread upon the minutes of the city council's meeting at which approval was granted. All contracts shall be executed in the manner and with the requisite formalities set forth in the City Charter or other applicable law. 
                  (b)  Repairs and general maintenance, where feasible, should be competitively bid; however, certain equipment, systems and facilities can only be repaired or serviced through authorized service centers or by specially trained personnel who do not engage in bidding. The public interest is best served by maintaining such equipment, systems and facilities in accordance with manufacturer's requirements and warranties. For this reason, such services may be obtained without first obtaining bids as generally required by this article. 
                  (c)  Pursuant to O.C.G.A. 13-10-91, all contracts for the physical performance of services within this state, to be binding on and enforceable against the city, shall require the contractor to register and participate in the federal work authorization program to verify work eligibility of all newly hired employees and subcontractors. Before a bid for any such service is considered by the city, the bid shall include a signed, notarized affidavit from the contractor attesting to the following: 
                  (1)  The affiant has registered with and is authorized to use the federal work authorization program; 
                  (2)  The user identification number and date of authorization for the affiant; and 
                  (3)  The affiant is using and will continue to use the federal work authorization program throughout the contract period. 
                  No contractor or subcontractor under contract with the city in connection with the physical performance of services within this state shall be entitled to payment from public funds for its services unless such contractor or subcontractor registers and participates in the federal work authorization program. It shall be deemed a breach of contract for any contractor, or subcontractor thereof, who physically performs services within this state under a contract with the city, to fail or refuse to participate in the federal work authorization program throughout the term of such contract. It shall be the duty of the contractor and/or subcontractor(s) to maintain records of federal work authorization verification for all newly hired employees for the term of the contract and to maintain such records for not less than three years from the contract's date of final completion. Such records shall be considered an open public record and made available to the city upon request or in the event of contract audit by a federal or state agency; provided, however, any information in such record protected from public disclosure by federal or state law shall be redacted.

                  Sec. 2-193. - Procurement of equipment, materials, and supplies. 
                  (a)  The city manager, in his discretion may delegate to the department manager the procurement of equipment, materials, and supplies having a gross or combined cost of less than $2,500.00; provided, however, purchases shall not be subdivided in an effort to evade the limitations of this section. Where feasible, whenever like purchases are required by more than one department, the purchasing agent shall consolidate purchase orders to receive full advantage of available quantity discounts. 
                  (b)  Insofar as it is practical for procurement of equipment, materials, or supplies having an estimated cost of more than $2,500.00 and less than $10,000.00, no less than three businesses shall be solicited to submit quotations, which shall be written where practical. Award shall be made to the business submitting the lowest responsive, responsible quotation. The names of the businesses submitting quotations, and the date and amount of each quotation, shall be recorded and maintained as a public record. The city clerk will provide a form to be used to summarize the quotations in a uniform manner. Purchases of less than $10,000.00 shall be approved, in writing, by the mayor or city manager. 
                  (c)  All other procurement of equipment, materials, or supplies having an estimated cost of more than $10,000.00 shall be competitively bid upon written specifications drawn by the department manager in consultation with, and as approved by, the purchasing agent. The manner of advertisement or bid solicitation (including the pre-qualification of potential vendors), the period bid solicitations remain open, and procedures governing bidding and bid openings shall be approved, in writing, by the city manager. ALL REQUESTS FOR PROCUREMENT SHALL BE ISSUED WITH RESERVATION OF THE CITY'S RIGHT TO REJECT ALL BIDS; TO REBID UPON READVERTISEMENT (WITH OR WITHOUT MODIFIED SPECIFICATIONS); OR, IN CASES WHERE ALL BIDS RECEIVED FAIL TO MEET SPECIFICATIONS, TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE BIDDER WHOSE PRODUCT COMES CLOSEST TO MEETING SPECIFICATIONS. Purchases of $10,000.00 or more shall be approved by the city council in a duly convened public meeting. 
                  (d)  The lowest responsive, responsible bid shall be approved. Where the lowest bid is not responsive or the bidder is not deemed responsible, written documentation shall be maintained explaining why the lowest bid was rejected. Where the amount of purchase is less than $10,000.00 the city manager shall determine rejection of the lowest bid; where the amount of purchase is $10,000.00 or more, rejection of the lowest bid shall be determined by the city council. 
                  (e)  In determining the lowest responsive, responsible bid or quotation, a preference of up to five percent or $250.00, whichever is least, may be given to manufacturers, distributors, materialmen and suppliers having local business addresses within the 30220 zip code area. Otherwise, as far as may be reasonable and practicable without sacrificing price or quality, preference may be given to Georgia suppliers over out-of-state suppliers. A similar preference may be given to American suppliers over foreign suppliers. 
                  (f)  The requirements of this section shall not be applicable to the purchase of equipment, material, and supplies when the city manager has determined the procurement of such item(s) is only available from a sole source. 
                  (g)  The requirements of this section shall not apply when procurement of equipment, material, and supplies is available through federal or state bulk purchasing programs, intergovernmental contracts, and similar cooperative buying services in which the city participates (including, but not limited to: the department of administrative services, Georgia Correctional Industries, Electric Cities of Georgia, and GMA programs).

                  (13)  It shall be unlawful for an employee whose permit has been revoked and upon whom demand for return of the card has been made, to refuse to return the card, or to alter, conceal, deface, or destroy the card. 
                  (14)  A new search may be conducted on any person issued a permit if the chief of police receives information which warrants such a new search. If the new search reveals evidence that warrants revocation of the permit, he may revoke the permit. 
                  (15)  Nothing herein shall in any way be construed to limit the liability of the licensee for the conduct of its employees.

                  (Prior Code, § 5.08.020; Ord. No. 716, 8-27-2001) 
                  Sec. 14-68. - Purpose and findings. 
                  (a)  Purpose. It is the purpose of this article to regulate sexually oriented businesses and related activities to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of the city, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of sexually oriented businesses within the city. The provisions of this article have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this article to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market, neither is it the intent nor effect of this article to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene materials. 
                  (b)  Findings. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on the community presented in hearings and in reports made available to the city council, and on findings incorporated in the cases of City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986); Young v. American Mini Theatres, 426 U.S. 50 (1976); and Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991); Arcara v. Cloud Books, Inc., 478 U.S. 697 (1986); California v. LaRue, 409 U.S. 109 (1972); Lacobucci v. City of Newport, Ky, 479 U.S. 92 (1986); United States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367 (1968); DLS, Inc. v. City of Chattanooga, 107 F.3d 403 (6th Cir. 1997); Key, Inc. v. Kitsap County, 793 F.2d 1053 (9th Cir. 1986); Hang On, Inc. v. City of Arlington, 65 F.3d 1248 (5th Cir. 1995); and South Florida Free Beaches, Inc. v. City of Miami, 734 F.2d 608 (11th Cir. 1984), as well as studies conducted in other cities, including, but not limited to, Phoenix, Arizona; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Houston, Texas; Indianapolis, Indiana; Amarillo, Texas; Garden Grove, California; Los Angeles, California; Whittier, California; Austin, Texas; Seattle, Washington; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Cleveland, Ohio; and Beaumont, Texas; and findings reported in the Final Report of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986), the Report of the Attorney General's Working Group on the Regulation of Sexually Oriented Businesses (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota), and statistics obtained from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the city council finds that: 
                  (1)  Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments. Further, there is presently no mechanism to make owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises. 
                  (2)  Crime statistics show that all types of crimes, especially sex-related crimes, occur with more frequency in neighborhoods where sexually oriented businesses are located. See, e.g., studies of the cities of Phoenix, Arizona; Indianapolis, Indiana; and Austin, Texas. 
                  (3)  Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur at sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live sex shows. See, e.g., California v. LaRue, 409 U.S. 109, III (1972); see also Final Report of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986) at 377. 
                  (4)  Offering and providing such booths and/or cubicles encourages such activities, which creates unhealthy conditions. See, e.g., Final Report of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986) at 376-77. 
                  (5)  Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades, and other sexually oriented businesses, for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses. See, e.g., Arcara v. Cloud Book, Inc., 478 U.S. 697, 698 (1986); see also Final Report of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986) at 376-77. 
                  (6)  At least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses, including, but not limited to, syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital herpes, hepatitis B, non-A, non-B amebiasis, salmonella infections, and shigella infections. See, e.g., Study of Fort Meyers, Florida. 
                  (7)  For the period 1985 through 1995, the total number of reported cases of AIDS in the United States caused by the immunodeficiency virus was 523,056. See, e.g., Statistics of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
                  (8)  Since 1981 and to the present, there has been an increasing cumulative number of persons testing positive for HIV antibody test in the state. 
                  (9)  The total number of cases of early (less than one year) syphilis in the United States reported during the ten-year period, 1985—1995, was 367,796. See, e.g., Statistics of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
                  (10)  The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States reported annually remains at a high level, with a total of one million 1,250,581 cases reported during the period 1993—1995. See, e.g., Statistics of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
                  (11)  The surgeon-general of the United States, in his report of October 22, 1986, advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug use, exposure to infected blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her newborn. 
                  (12)  According to the best scientific evidence available, AIDS and HIV infection, as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts. See findings of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
                  (13)  Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and, in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate those activities and maintain those facilities. See, e.g., Final Report of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986) at 377. 
                  (14)  Numerous studies and reports have determined that bodily fluids, including semen and urine, are found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view "adult" oriented films. See, e.g., Final report of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986) at 377. 
                  (15)  Nude dancing in adult establishments encourages prostitution, increases sexual assaults, and attracts other criminal activity. See, e.g., Barnes v. Glen Theatre, 501 U.S. 560, 583 (1991). 
                  (16)  Nude dancing in adult establishments increases the likelihood of drug dealing and drug use. See, e.g., Key, Inc. v. Kitsap County, 793 F.2d 1053, 1056 (9th Cir. 1986). 
                  (17)  The findings noted in subsections (b)(1) through (16) of this section raise substantial governmental concerns. 
                  (18)  Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns. 
                  (19)  A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health, safety, and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the city. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business, fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein. 
                  (20)  Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on the premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult establishments. 
                  (21)  The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business, where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and criminal activity. 
                  (22)  It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct this article is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity. 
                  (23)  The fact that an applicant for a sexually oriented business license has been convicted of a sex-related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention to this article. 
                  (24)  The barring of such individuals from operation or employment in sexually oriented businesses for a period of ten years for a previous felony conviction serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases. 
                  (25)  The general welfare, health, morals, and safety of the citizens of this city will be promoted by the enactment of the ordinance codified in this article.

                  DRASTIC means the standardized system for evaluating groundwater pollution potential using the hydrogeologic settings described in U.S. Environmental Protection Agency document EPA-600/2-87-035. The DRASTIC methodology is the most widely used technique for evaluating pollution susceptibility. 
                  Hazardous waste means any solid waste, by reason of its toxic, caustic, corrosive, abrasive, or otherwise injurious properties may be detrimental to the health of any person handling or otherwise coming into contact with such material or substance. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has developed a list of hazardous wastes based upon corrosivity, reactivity and toxicity. 
                  Pollution susceptibility means the relative vulnerability of an aquifer to being polluted from spills, discharges, leaks, impoundments, applications of chemicals, injections and other human activities in the recharge area. 
                  Pollution susceptibility maps means maps of relative vulnerability to pollution prepared by the department of natural resources, using the DRASTIC methodology. Pollution susceptibility maps categorize the land areas of the state into areas having high, medium and low groundwater pollution potential. 
                  Recharge area means any portion of the earth's surface, where water infiltrates into the ground to replenish an aquifer. 
                  River/stream bank means the rising ground, bordering a river or a stream, which serves to confine the water to the natural channel during the normal course of flow. 
                  Significant recharge area means those areas mapped by the department of natural resources in Hydrologic Atlas 18 (1998) edition. Mapping of recharge areas is based on outcrop area, lithology, soil type, thickness, slope, density of lithologic contacts, geologic structure, presence of karst, and potentiometric surfaces. Significant recharge areas are as follows in the various geologic provinces of the state: In the Piedmont and in the Blue Ridge, rocks have little primary porosity, with most groundwater being stored in the overlying soils. The significant recharge are those with thicker soils. Field mapping indicates thick soils in the Piedmont and Blue Ridge are characterized by a density of two or more geologic contacts per four square miles (source: 1976 1:500,000 Geologic Map of Georgia) and slopes lower than eight percent. 
                  Utility means public, private water or sewer piping systems, water or sewer pumping stations, electric power lines, fuel pipelines, telephone lines, roads, driveways, bridges, river/lake access facilities, stormwater systems and railroads or other utilities identified by a local government. 
                  Wetland district means a map overlay which imposes a set of requirements in addition to those of the underlying zoning district. 
                  Wetlands means those areas inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas. The ecological parameters for designating wetlands include hydric soils, hydrological vegetation and hydrological conditions involving a temporary or permanent source of water to cause soil saturation.

                  The wetlands within the city are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion and soil limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; natural resource education; scientific study; and recreational opportunities.

                  Sec. 17-147. - Post-development stormwater management performance criteria. 
                  The following performance criteria shall be applicable to all stormwater management plans, unless otherwise provided for in this article: 
                  (1)  Water quality. All stormwater runoff generated from a site shall be adequately treated before discharge. It will be presumed that a stormwater management system complies with this requirement if: 
                  a.  It is sized to treat the prescribed water quality treatment volume from the site, as defined in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual; 
                  b.  Appropriate structural stormwater controls or nonstructural practices are selected, designed, constructed or preserved, and maintained according to the specific criteria in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual; and 
                  c.  Runoff from hotspot land uses and activities identified by the city are adequately treated and addressed through the use of appropriate structural stormwater controls, nonstructural practices and pollution prevention practices. 
                  (2)  Stream channel protection. Protection of stream channels from bank and bed erosion and degradation shall be provided by using all of the following three approaches: 
                  a.  Preservation, restoration and/or reforestation (with native vegetation) of the applicable stream buffer; 
                  b.  24-hour extended detention storage of the one-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event; 
                  c.  Erosion prevention measures such as energy dissipation and velocity control. 
                  (3)  Overbank flooding protection. Downstream overbank flood and property protection shall be provided by controlling (attenuating) the post-development peak discharge rate to the predevelopment rate for the 25-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event. If control of the one-year, 24-hour storm under subsection (2) of this section is exempted, then peak discharge rate attenuation of the two-year through the 25-year return frequency storm event must be provided. 
                  (4)  Extreme flooding protection. Extreme flood and public safety protection shall be provided by controlling and safely conveying the 100-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event such that flooding is not exacerbated. 
                  (5)  Structural stormwater controls. All structural stormwater management facilities shall be selected and designed using the appropriate criteria from the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. All structural stormwater controls must be designed appropriately to meet their intended function. For other structural stormwater controls not included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual, or for which pollutant removal rates have not been provided, the effectiveness and pollutant removal of the structural control must be documented through prior studies, literature reviews, or other means and receive approval from the city before being included in the design of a stormwater management system. In addition, if hydrologic or topographic conditions, or land use activities warrant greater control than that provided by the minimum control requirements, the city may impose additional requirements deemed necessary to protect upstream and downstream properties and aquatic resources from damage due to increased volume, frequency, and rate of stormwater runoff or increased nonpoint source pollution loads created on the site in question. Applicants shall consult the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual for guidance on the factors that determine site design feasibility when selecting and locating a structural stormwater control. 
                  (6)  Stormwater credits for nonstructural measures. The use of one or more site design measures by the applicant may allow for a reduction in the water quality treatment volume required under subsection (1) of this section. The applicant may, if approved by the city, take credit for the use of stormwater better site design practices and reduce the water quality volume requirement. For each potential credit, there is a minimum set of criteria and requirements which identify the conditions or circumstances under which the credit may be applied. The site design practices that qualify for this credit and the criteria and procedures for applying and calculating the credits are included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. 
                  (7)  Drainage system guidelines. Stormwater conveyance facilities, which may include but are not limited to culverts, stormwater drainage pipes, catchbasins, drop inlets, junction boxes, headwalls, gutter, swales, channels, ditches, and energy dissipaters shall be provided when necessary for the protection of public right-of-way and private properties adjoining project sites and/or public right-of-ways. Stormwater conveyance facilities that are designed to carry runoff from more that one parcel, existing or proposed, shall meet the following requirements: 
                  a.  Methods to calculate stormwater flows shall be in accordance with the stormwater design manual; 
                  b.  All culverts, pipe systems and open channel flow systems shall be sized in accordance with the stormwater management plan using the methods included in the stormwater design manual; and 
                  c.  Design and construction of stormwater conveyance facilities shall be in accordance with the criteria and specifications found in the stormwater design manual. 
                  (8)  Dam design guidelines. Any land disturbing activity that involves a site which proposes a dam shall comply with the Georgia Safe Dams Act and the rules for dam safety, as applicable.

                  An engineering study is required, as appropriate to the proposed development activities on the site, whenever a development proposes to disturb any land within the future-conditions floodplain, except for a residential single-lot development on streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodways for which the provisions of section 17-275 apply. This study shall be prepared by a currently registered professional engineer in the state and made a part of the application for a permit. This information shall be submitted to and approved by the city prior to the approval of any permit which would authorize the disturbance of land located within the future-conditions floodplain. Such study shall include: 
                  (1)  Description of the extent to which any watercourse or floodplain will be altered or relocated as a result of the proposed development; 
                  (2)  Step backwater analysis, using a FEMA-approved methodology approved by the city. Cross section s (which may be supplemented by the applicant) and flow information will be obtained whenever available. Computations will be shown duplicating FIS results and will then be rerun with the proposed modifications to determine the new base flood profiles, and future-conditions flood profiles; 
                  (3)  Floodplain storage calculations based on cross sections (at least one every 100 feet) showing existing and proposed floodplain conditions to show that base flood floodplain and future-conditions floodplain storage capacity would not be diminished by the development; 
                  (4)  The study shall include a preliminary plat, grading plan, or site plan, as appropriate, which shall clearly define all future-conditions floodplain encroachments.

                  Sec. 17-253. - Floodway encroachments. 
                  Located within areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, floodways must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore the following provisions shall apply: 
                  (1)  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway, except for activities specifically allowed in subsection (2) of this section; 
                  (2)  Encroachments for bridges, culverts, roadways and utilities within the regulatory floodway may be permitted provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase to the pre-project base flood elevations, floodway elevations, or floodway widths during the base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof; and 
                  (3)  If the applicant proposes to revise the floodway boundaries, no permit authorizing the encroachment into or an alteration of the floodway shall be issued by the city until an affirmative conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) is issued by FEMA and no-rise certification is approved by the city.

                  Sec. 17-303. - Procedures. 
                  The variance and appeals procedures set forth in this division shall apply to an applicant who has been denied a permit for a development activity, or to an owner or developer who has not applied for a permit because it is clear that the proposed development activity would be inconsistent with the provisions of this article. A request for a variance may be submitted as follows by an applicant who has been denied a permit by the city or by an owner or developer who has not previously applied for a permit for the reasons stated hereinabove: 
                  (1)  Requests for variances from the requirements of this article shall be submitted to the city. All such requests shall be heard and decided in a public hearing by mayor and council of the city. The hearing shall be advertised in the legal organ of the city no less than 15 and no more than 45 days from the date of the hearing and shall state the place and time of the hearing. 
                  (2)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the city council may appeal such decision to the superior court of the county, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1. 
                  (3)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure, and the variance issued shall be the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (4)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this section are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (5)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (6)  In reviewing such requests, the city and city council shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article. 
                  (7)  Conditions for variances. 
                  a.  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  1.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
                  2.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  3.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, or the creation of a nuisance. 
                  b.  The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore, any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of a historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  c.  Any person to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  d.  The city manager or designee shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (8)  Any person requesting a variance shall, from the time of the request until the time the request is acted upon, submit such information and documentation as the city council shall deem necessary to the consideration of the request. 
                  (9)  Upon consideration of the factors listed in subsection (1) through (8) of this section and the purposes of this article, the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as they deem necessary or appropriate, consistent with the purposes of this article. 
                  (10)  Variances shall not be issued after the fact.

                  (2)  In the event the commission determines a failure to provide ordinary maintenance or repair, the commission will notify the owner of the property and set forth the steps which need to be taken to remedy the situation. The owner of such property will have 30 days in which to do this. 
                  (3)  In the event that the condition is not remedied in 30 days, the owner shall be punished, as provided in section 20-2 and, at the direction of the city council, the commission may perform such maintenance or repair as is necessary to prevent deterioration by neglect. The owner of the property shall be liable for the cost of such maintenance and repair performed by the commission. 
                  (c)  Affirmation of existing building and zoning codes.

                  (2)  If the offender is endeavoring to escape; or 
                  (3)  For other cause there is likely to be failure of justice for want of an officer to issue a warrant.

                  Nuisances means anything that causes hurt, inconvenience, or damage to all persons who come within the sphere of its operation, though it may vary in its effects on individuals. The fact that the act done may otherwise be lawful shall not keep it from being a nuisance. The inconvenience complained of shall not be fanciful, or such as would affect only one of fastidious taste, but it shall be such as would affect an ordinary, reasonable man.

                  (c)  A complaint alleging a nuisance shall be filed with the clerk of the city recorder's court. The clerk shall refer such complaint to a police officer or marshal of said court of the city for investigation.

                  If after an investigation, such officer determines that there is probable cause to believe a nuisance exists, the officer shall cite the party responsible for the alleged nuisance to appear at the next regularly scheduled recorder's court session, provided that the hearing shall be held not less than 15 days nor more than 45 days after the filing of a complaint in the court. Said officer shall also give notice to all interested parties of the date of the hearing and subpoena any necessary witnesses.

                  After a complete judicial hearing, if the recorder's court judge shall determine that a public nuisance exists, he shall enter an order directed to the responsible party instructing either of the following: 
                  (1)  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter, or improve such dwelling, building, or structure so as to bring it into full compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violation and, if applicable, to secure the structure so that it cannot be used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or 
                  (2)  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure in order to bring it into full compliance with applicable codes relevant to the cited violations cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to demolish and remove such dwelling, building, or structure and all debris from the property.

                  Sec. 26-5. - Owner failure to comply. 
                  (a)  If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair or demolish the dwelling, building, or structure, the public officer may cause such dwelling, building, or structure to be repaired, altered, or improved or to be vacated and closed or demolished.

                  "This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business use and does not comply with the applicable codes or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with drug crimes or constitutes an endangerment to public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful." 
                  (b)  If the public officer has the structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any moneys received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. The public officer and city council are relieved of any and all liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials. 
                  (c)  The amount of the cost of demolition, including all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the county tax commissioner or municipal tax collector or city revenue officer, and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, including restoration to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred.

                  It shall be the duty of every person owning a vacant lot in the city to keep their lot well maintained, in a sanitary condition, and free from any accumulation of trash or unsightly growth.

                  Sec. 26-106. - Complaint in rem in municipal court; procedure; lien; appeal. 
                  (a)  Whenever a request is filed with the public officer by a public authority or by at least five residents of the municipality charging that any dwelling, building, structure, or property is unfit for human habitation or for commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the public officer may make an investigation or inspection of the specific dwelling, building, structure, or property and make a written report of his findings.

                  (7)  The presence of graffiti which is visible from adjoining public or private property. 
                  (b)  If the public officer's investigation or inspection identifies that any dwelling, building, structure, or property is unfit for human habitation or for commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the public officer shall file a complaint in rem in the municipal court of the city against the lot, tract, or parcel of real property on which such dwelling, building, or structure is situated or where such public health hazard or general nuisance exists and shall cause summons and a copy of the complaint to be served on the interested parties in such dwelling, building, or structure. The complaint shall identify the subject real property by appropriate street address and official tax map reference; identify the interested parties; state with particularity the factual basis for the action; and contain a statement of the action sought by the public officer to abate the alleged nuisance. The summons shall notify the interested parties that a hearing will be held before the municipal court at a date and time certain and at a place within the county or municipality where the property is located.

The interested parties shall have the right to file an answer to the complaint and to appear in person or by attorney and offer testimony at the time and place fixed for hearing. 
                  (c)  If, after such notice and hearing, the court determines that the dwelling, building, or structure in question is unfit for human habitation or is unfit for its current commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the court shall state, in writing, findings of fact in support of such determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the interested parties that have answered the complaint or appeared at the hearing an order: 
                  (1)  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter, or improve such dwelling, building, or structure so as to bring it into full compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violation; and, if applicable, to secure by closing the structure so that it cannot be used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or 
                  (2)  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure in order to bring it into full compliance with applicable codes relevant to the cited violations cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to demolish and remove such dwelling, building, or structure and all debris from the property. 
                  For purposes of this section, the court shall make its determination of reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure without consideration of the value of the land on which the structure is situated; provided, however, that costs of the preparation necessary to repair, alter, or improve a structure may be considered; and, provided further, that if the unsatisfactory condition is limited solely to the presence of graffiti, the dwelling, building or structure shall not be ordered demolished or closed, but its owner may be ordered to repair the same by cleaning or removal of the graffiti. Income and financial status of the owner shall not be a factor in the court's determination. The present value of the structure and the costs of repair, alteration, or improvement may be established by affidavits of real estate appraisers with a Georgia appraiser classification as provided in O.C.G.A. title 43, chapter 39A, qualified building contractors, or qualified building inspectors without actual testimony presented. Costs of repair, alteration, or improvement of the structure shall be the cost necessary to bring the structure into compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violations in force in the jurisdiction. 
                  (d)  If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair or demolish the dwelling, building, or structure, the public officer shall cause such dwelling, building, or structure to be repaired, altered, or improved, or to be vacated and closed, or demolished within 270 days of the expiration of time specified in the order for abatement by the owner. Any time during which such action is prohibited by a court order issued pursuant to subsection (c) of this section or any equitable relief granted by a court of competent jurisdiction shall not be counted toward the 270 days in which such abatement action shall commence. The public officer shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of the building, dwelling, or structure a placard with the following words: 
                  "This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business use and does not comply with the applicable codes or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with drug crimes or constitutes an endangerment to public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful." 
                  (e)  If the public officer has the structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any moneys received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. The public officer and governing authority are relieved of any and all liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials. 
                  (f)  The amount of the cost of demolition, including all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the tax commissioner, and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, including restoration to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred. 
                  (g)  The lien provided for in subsection (e) shall attach to the real property upon the filing of a certified copy of the order requiring repair, closure, or demolition in the office of the clerk of superior court in Coweta County and shall relate back to the date of the filing of the lis pendens notice required under subsection (a). The clerk of superior court shall record and index such certified copy of the order in the deed records of the county and enter the lien on the general execution docket. The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except liens for taxes to which the lien shall be inferior, and shall continue in force until paid. After filing a certified copy of the order with the clerk of superior court, the public officer shall, within 90 days of the completion of repairs, demolition or closure, forward a copy of the order and a final statement of costs to the county tax commissioner. 
                  (h)  It shall be the duty of the county tax commissioner to collect the amount of the lien in conjunction with the collection of ad valorem taxes on the property and to collect the amount of the lien as if it were a real property ad valorem tax, using all methods available for collecting real property ad valorem taxes, including specifically O.C.G.A. § 48-4-5; provided, however, that the limitation of O.C.G.A § 48-4-78 which requires 12 months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure shall not apply; provided, further, that redemption of property from the lien may be made in accordance with the provisions of O.C.G.A. §§ 48-4-80 and 48-4-81. The tax commissioner may initiate enforcement of liens imposed under this section at any time following receipt of the final determination of costs from the public officer. The unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties from and after the date of final determination of costs in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes. 
                  (i)  The tax commissioner shall remit the amount collected to the governing authority of the municipality whose ordinance is being enforced. The tax commissioner may retain an amount equal to the cost of administering collection of the lien. Any such amount collected and retained for administration shall be deposited in the general fund of the county to pay the cost of administering the lien. 
                  (j)  The governing authority may waive and release any such lien imposed on property upon the owner of such property entering into a contract with the municipality agreeing to a timetable for rehabilitation of the real property or the dwelling, building, or structure on the property and demonstrating the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation. 
                  (k)  Review of a court order requiring the repair, alteration, improvement, or demolition of a dwelling, building, or structure shall be by direct appeal to the superior court under O.C.G.A. § 5-3-29.

                  (2)  At least 14 days prior to the date of the hearing, the public officer shall mail copies of the complaint and summons by certified mail or statutory overnight delivery, return receipt requested, to all interested parties whose identities and addresses are readily ascertainable. Copies of the complaint and summons shall also be mailed by first-class mail to the property address to the attention of the occupants, if any; 
                  (3)  For interested parties whose mailing address is unknown, a notice stating the date, time, and place of the hearing shall be published in the newspaper in which the sheriffs advertisements appear in such county once a week for two consecutive weeks prior to the hearing; and 
                  (4)  A notice of lis pendens shall be filed in the office of the clerk of superior court in which the dwelling, building, structure, or property is located at the time of filing the complaint in municipal court. 
                  (b)  The public officer shall cause an affidavit of service to be filed of record in the municipal court prior to the hearing showing compliance with the service requirements of this section. Such affidavit shall constitute a prima facie showing of minimum procedural due process and shall constitute sufficient proof that service was perfected. 
                  (c)  Orders and other filings made subsequent to service of the initial complaint shall be served in the manner provided in this section on every interested party who answers the complaint or appears at the hearing. Any interested party who fails to answer or appear at the hearing shall be deemed to have waived all further notice in the proceedings.

Approval of a permit and inspection of a property shall in no manner guarantee or warrant to the owner or occupants thereof that said property has been constructed, maintained, or operated in conformance with applicable codes, laws and regulations. The city reserves the right to assert all available immunities and defenses in any action seeking to impose monetary damages upon the city, its officers, employees and agents arising out of any alleged failure or breach of duty or relationship as may now exist or hereafter be created. To the extent any federal or state law, regulation, or ordinance requires compliance as a condition precedent to the issuance of a permit, plan or design approval, inspection or other activity by the city, its officers, employees and agents, issuance of such permit, approval, or inspection shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver or estoppel of the condition precedent, and it shall remain the obligation and responsibility of the owner, his design professional(s), and contractor(s) to satisfy such legal requirements.

                  The existence of real property which is maintained in a blighted condition increases the burden of the state and local government by increasing the need for government services, including but not limited to social services, public safety services, and code enforcement services. Rehabilitation of blighted property decreases this need for such government services. 
                  In furtherance of its objective to eradicate conditions of slum and blight within the city, this board of commissioners, in exercise of the powers granted to municipal corporations at Chapter 61, Urban Redevelopment, of Title 36 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, has designated those areas of the city where conditions of slum and blight are found or are likely to spread. 
                  In recognition of the need for enhanced governmental services and in order to encourage private property owners to maintain their real property and the buildings, structures and improvement thereon in good condition and repair, and as an incentive to encourage community redevelopment, a community redevelopment tax incentive program is hereby established as authorized by Article IX, Section II, Paragraph VII(d) of the 1983 Constitution of the State of Georgia.

                  (a)  Bi-directional metering. 
                  (1)  When electricity supplied by the city exceeds electricity generated by the customer's distributed generation, the electricity shall be billed by the city in accordance with the applicable tariff(s). 
                  (2)  When electricity generated by the customer's distributed generation system exceeds electricity supplied by the city, the customer shall be billed for the customer charges as described in the standard rate for that billing period and credited for excess kwh generated during the billing period at the city's avoided energy cost. 
                  (b)  Single directional metering. 
                  (1)  For kwh's generated by customer's distributed generation facility, customer shall be compensated at the city's avoided cost of energy (kwh) as determined by the city. The city will only compensate customer for avoided energy kwh's as determined by metered energy delivered to the city's distribution system. 
                  (2)  The customer's net bill will be calculated using the city calculation for avoided energy cost (as described below) credited to the customer, netted against the billing period charges for the customer's regular service (according to the applicable tariff) based on actual metered energy. 
                  (c)  Avoided energy cost. Payments by the city to the customer for the billing period metered avoided energy kwh's will be computed by the city in its sole discretion based on the average monthly wholesale market price as determined by the Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia (MEAG Power), the city's wholesale energy provider. 
                  In the event customer develops a credit balance during a billing period, the amount will remain as a credit on the customer's account. Credit balances remaining at the end of the city's fiscal year will be cleared by the issuance of a check for the credit balance to customer. Any other clearance of account credit balances will be at the city's discretion.

                  The provisions in all documents outlined above are incorporated into this tariff in their entirety. For the avoidance of doubt, customer shall be deemed to have agreed to such provisions by applying for service under this tariff. 
                  (b)  The city will only be required to purchase energy from eligible distributed generation facilities on a first-come, first-served basis until the cumulative generating capacity of all renewable energy sources from all customers equals the percentage of the city's annual peak demand in the previous year as set forth in O.C.G.A. § 46-3-56(a). Additional energy may be purchased by the city at its sole discretion at a cost agreed to by it and the customer provider. The city shall at no time be required to purchase energy from customers in excess of amounts required by the DG Act. 
                  (c)  The city reserves the right to separate the customer generator's equipment from city lines and facilities when, in the city's judgment, the continued parallel operation is unsafe or may cause damage to persons or property. Upon such separation, the city shall promptly notify the customer generator so that any unsafe condition can be corrected.

                  The purpose of this ordinance is to establish minimum standards for the use of land and improvements in the City of Grantville, Georgia. The zoning regulations and districts herein established are designed to: 
                  •  Lessen congestion in the streets; 
                  •  Provide safety from fire, panic, and other dangers; 
                  •  Promote health, and general welfare; 
                  •  Provide adequate light and air; 
                  •  Avoid undue concentration of the population; 
                  •  Provision of transportation, water, sewerage, schools, parks and other public requirements; 
                  •  Conserve the value of economy; 
                  •  Encourage the most appropriate use of land and structures; 
                  •  Promote quality of life for all citizens; 
                  •  Provide consistency with Land Use Element of the Comprehensive Plan. 
                  [Sec.] 2.2. 
                  The requirements of these regulations are minimum permissible standards; and it is expected that developers and the respective decision making authority will normally strive for quality developments which will exceed these minimum requirements. 
                  [Sec.] 2.3. 
                  By this section, the Comprehensive Plan adopted by resolution of the City Council of the City of Grantville is established as the official policy of the City concerning land uses. The incorporated areas of the City are divided into land use categories consistent with the Future Land Use Plan in the Land Use Element of the Comprehensive Plan. The Comprehensive Plan does not alter or affect the existing zoning districts in the City, does not effectuate an amendment to the official zoning maps, and does not itself permit or prohibit any existing land uses. The Land Use Element of the Comprehensive Plan shall be amended on an annual basis to reflect changes in land use and to discover any inconsistencies zoning changes have caused in the Future Land Use map. 
                  [Sec.] 2.4. 
                  The Land Use Element of the Comprehensive Plan shall be updated once each year. This update shall be used to identify current uses of land, emerging growth patterns and any significant change in land use policy as identified by the Future Land Use map of the Comprehensive Plan. This update shall also be used as policy in the City's consideration of proposed amendments to the zoning map or text of the zoning ordinance. All amendments to the City of Grantville's Comprehensive Plan shall be in accordance with the Minimum Planning Standards and Procedures of the Georgia Planning Act.

                  [Sec.] 4.1. - Establishment of Districts. 
                  In order to carry out the intent and purpose of this ordinance, the City of Grantville is hereby divided into the following districts: 

                   
                  4.1-1  Rural Development District (RD). This district is intended to permit a combination of low-density residential uses of various types, limited agricultural activities and associated uses. The regulations of the district are designed primarily to encourage a compatible relationship between agriculture and low-density, single-family rural residential development. 
                  4.1-2  Single-Family Residential (R20). The purpose of this district is to accommodate medium-density single-family residences. Single family dwellings are restricted to meeting Type I Appearance Standards. 
                  4.1-3  Neighborhood Unit Plan (NUP). The NUP district is intended to provide land areas devoted to low- to medium-density single-family residential uses of three (3) or fewer units per acre consistent with the densities ranges suggested by the City Council. The NUP district is intended to: 1) encourage the development of medium sized tracts of land as planned neighborhoods or the development of vacant parcels of land with transitional densities in built-up areas; 2) encourage the preservation of trees and vegetation; and to 3) encourage innovative site planning. 
                  4.1-4  Multi-Family Residential (R6). The purpose of this district is to accommodate higher density multi-family residential. Because of higher density, areas to be developed for this district would need a street system which will accommodate higher traffic volumes and are limited to the areas of the City served by sewer. 
                  4.1-5  Commercial Residential (CR). This district is designed to provide a high quality environment for limited retail activities, offices for professional services and residential uses as part of the commercial structures. 
                  4.1-6  General Commercial (GC). The purpose of this district is provide appropriate locations for a wide variety of commercial activities which will serve a large market area. This district will generally be located along the major arterial highways or where these highways meet. Emphasis is on creating commercial nodes rather than strip developments. 
                  4.1-7  General Industrial District (GI). The purpose of this district is to provide suitable areas for warehousing, distribution, manufacturing and other intensive activities of an industrial nature. 
                  4.1-8  Office Institutional (OI). This district is for offices, institutions and limited commercial activities not involving the sale, storage or processing of merchandise unless otherwise permitted. 
                  4.1-9  Parks and Recreation (PR). This district is designed to be a public park and open space district. Such parks and open space may be owned and/or operated by the City or the County and intended for public use. All improvements within these districts must be consistent with the approved park master plan (when it occurs) for the site of the City Comprehensive Plan. Land set aside as open space and placed under a conservation easement may also be classified in this district. Conditional Uses: Library, meeting hall, athletic facilities, museum and public non-commercial picnic areas and campgrounds. 
                  4.1-10  Light Industrial (LM). This district is established to provide for manufacturing and related activities having a minimal impact on the environment and surrounding land uses. The district is intended to attract a complementary mix of assembly, fabricating, distribution, warehousing, and service firms. A goal of the light industrial district is to provide architectural and site design standards which encourage development of such uses in a park setting, yielding benefits to business operators, employees and the community. Several factors distinguish the LM, light industrial district from the (GI), General Industrial district. A restrictive range of uses, architectural and site design standards, and generally smaller building sizes and lower lot coverage ratios in the LM are examples of these factors. 
                  4.1-10.1  Purpose. The LM, light industrial district is established to provide for manufacturing and related activities having a minimal impact on the environment and surrounding land uses. The district is intended to attract a complementary mix of assembly, fabricating, distribution, warehousing, and service firms. A goal of the light industrial district is to provide architectural and site design standards which encourage development of such uses in a park setting, yielding benefits to business operators, employees and the community. Several factors distinguish the LM, light industrial district from the (GI), General Industrial district. A restrictive range of uses, architectural and site design standards, and generally smaller building sizes and lower lot coverage ratios in the LM are examples of these factors. 
                  4.1-10.2  Permitted Uses. The following uses shall be permitted in any LM zoning district, provided no objectionable noise, vibration, smoke, gas, fume, odor, dust, fire hazard, radiation, or other injurious or obnoxious condition related to those uses creates a nuisance beyond the premises on which they are located:

                  4.1-11  Highway 29 Overlay District. 
                  4.1-11.1  Purpose. 
                  1.  Highway 29, which serves as the gateway to Grantville as well as Coweta County, is on the threshold of a tremendous boom in residential, commercial, and industrial growth. Development of well over 1,000 acres of raw land is being driven by proximity to Atlanta and Hartsfield International Airport, as well as access to the interstate system. 
                  2.  The regulations set forth in this Section 4.1-11 are intended to insure attractive developments which are complimentary and will promote a mix of uses rather than the undesirable commercial sprawl which has plagued many communities, such as Union City and the Georgia Highway 138 corridor. These standards will reinforce and implement a land use plan that features residential, office, personal services, hospitality uses, and retail uses along Highway 29. 
                  3.  To this end, it is the City's dual goal to protect the aesthetics of the community and to encourage both commercial and residential development along the Highway 29 corridor. 
                  4.1-11.2  Overlay District. This district is intended as an overlay district regulating and allowing the establishment of uses within the configuration of the allowable "Highway 29 Overlay District" boundaries. Said boundary shall include any properties or portions thereof, located within Five Hundred (500) feet of the Highway 29 right-of-way, as it presently exists or may exist in the future. The underlying district shall continue as permitted uses. Standards set out in this Section for Site Development and Architectural Design shall control over any underlying district regulations. 
                  4.1-11.3  Site Development Standards 
                  A.  In order to establish and maintain the Highway 29 Overlay District as a quality area which will preserve the investments of all land owners and developers, as well as encourage both commercial and residential development within the City, all development within the Highway 29 Overlay District must comply with the following standards: 
                  1.  Landscaped Buffers. The following schedule shall control land development as specified: 
                  a.  Retail and commercial services development. Such developments shall provide a landscaped buffer with a minimum horizontal dimension of thirty five (35) feet adjacent to the Hwy 29 right-of-way. A buffer with a minimum horizontal dimension of seventy-five (75) feet shall be provided where such developments are proposed adjacent to property developed as, or planned as, office use. A one hundred (100) foot buffer shall be provided on retail and commercial services developments which adjoin property developed as, or planned as, residential use. 
                  b.  Office development. Office development shall provide a landscaped buffer with a minimum horizontal dimension of forty five (45) feet adjacent to the Highway 29 right-of-way. A buffer with a minimum horizontal dimension of forty (40) feet shall be provided on office developments which adjoin property developed as, or planned as, residential use. 
                  c.  Residential development. Residential development shall provide a landscaped buffer with a minimum horizontal dimension of forty-five (45) feet adjacent to the Highway 29 right-of-way. Such buffers shall conform to the standards of Article 6 of the Zoning Ordinance and shall provide berms designed to achieve topographic variation. 
                  2.  Building Setbacks. The following schedule shall control building setbacks for all commercial construction: 
                  a.  Front yard setback. The minimum front yard setback shall be fifty (50) feet. The minimum setback on corner lots shall be fifty (50) feet from each street right-of-way. 
                  b.  Side yard setback. The minimum side yard setback shall be twenty (20) feet. 
                  c.  Rear yard setback. The minimum side yard setback shall be thirty (30) feet. 
                  3.  Off-street Parking. All retail and commercial uses shall provide a parking ratio of one space for every two hundred (200) square feet of enclosed retail floor area available to the public. One parking space shall be provided for every one thousand (1,000) square feet of floor area used for storage, assembly, warehousing or other purpose, provided that such areas are not available to the public. Such uses shall provide four and one-half (4½) parking spaces per one thousand (1,000) square feet to enclosed retail floor area available to the public, provided the establishments served by the parking spaces comprise a unified shopping center. All such off-street parking areas shall conform to the landscape standards provided in Article 7 of the Zoning Ordinance unless exceeded herein. 
                  4.  No loading areas shall be permitted between buildings and the Highway 29. 
                  5.  Site utilities shall be underground. 
                  6.  All development of sites in the Hwy 29 Overlay District shall preserve open areas according to the following formula: 
                  a.  Projects which disturb areas of open space greater than (1) acre shall retain a minimum of thirty (30) percent of the gross site acreage in permanent open space. 
                  b.  Projects which disturb areas of open space greater than (1) acre and provide a variety of site amenities, including but not limited to walking paths or trails, benches, lighting, picnic areas, and recreation facilities, shall retain a minimum of twenty (20) percent of the gross site acreage in improved open space. 
                  c.  Projects which disturb areas of open space greater than (1) acre and provide site amenities consistent with the provisions of (b), above, and link those areas to similar areas on adjoining property which currently exist or could reasonably be utilized as open space, shall retain a minimum of ten (10) percent of the gross site acreage in improved open space. 
                  d.  Projects which alter the site's natural drainage system by grading an area greater than fifty (50) percent of the gross acreage of the site, or by installing drainage structures requiring piping above eighteen (18) inches in diameter shall retain thirty (30) percent of the gross acreage in open space. 
                  e.  Projects which preserve natural drainage swales and associated areas in permanent, natural settings shall retain twenty (20) percent of the gross acreage in open space. 
                  f.  Projects which preserve natural drainage swales and associated areas in permanent, natural settings, and which are linked to natural drainage routes on adjoining properties, shall retain ten (10) percent of the gross acreage in open space.

                  8.  Required yard areas are not credited toward the open space reservation. 
                  9.  Developers are encouraged to create secondary road networks through a system of density (lot coverage or building height) bonuses. Lot coverage ratios, inclusive of the building footprint and pavement for parking and driveways, shall not exceed seventy-five (75) percent. Pavement comprising internal street networks shall be exempted provided such street networks channel traffic between developments along Highway 29 and are not directly linked to Highway 29. 
                  10.  Secondary road networks which provide a landscaped boulevard and are linked to adjoining properties shall entitle the property owner to density bonuses. 
                  11.  Access to Highway 29 shall be limited to one driveway per existing parcel. Density bonuses shall be granted for consolidation of driveways currently permitted by Georgia Department of Transportation. 
                  12.  Preservation of natural features shall encompass pedestrian amenities linked to adjoining properties. All development shall provide sidewalks linked to such amenities as well as adjoining properties. 
                  4.1-11.4  Architectural Design Standards. In addition to the site development standards set forth in Section 4.1-11.3, all construction within the Highway 29 Overlay District must comply with the following standards:

Within each zoning district indicated on the Official Zoning Map and subject to all requirements and conditions specified in this Ordinance, land, buildings, and structures shall only be used and buildings and structures shall only be erected which are intended or designed to be used for uses listed in the Permitted Use Schedule, Table 5.3. In the appropriate columns of Table 5.3 uses permitted by right in the various districts are indicated with a "P", uses requiring a Special Use Permit are indicated by an "S", uses permitted by right are subject to meeting additional development standards as set forth in the Zoning Ordinance and Subdivision Regulations. 
                  5.3-2 Formulation of Permitted Use Schedule. 
                  a.  The Standard Industrial Classification Manual - 1987 was utilized in the preparation of this table and shall be referred to as a guide for purposes of interpretation by the Zoning Administrator or Code Enforcement Officer. SIC Codes are used to refer to SIC Classifications. Entries with 0000 in the Reference SIC column do not correspond to any classification in the SIC Manual. 
                  b.  When a use is not listed in the Permitted Use Schedule, the Zoning Administrator or Code Enforcement Officer shall classify it with that use in the table most similar to it. The SIC Manual shall serve as a guide in classifying any unlisted use. If the Zoning Administrator or Code Enforcement Officer should determine that a use is not listed and is not similar to a use in the Permitted Use Schedule, then said use is prohibited. 
                  c.  Rental and leasing of any commodity shall be permitted under the same classification and in the same districts as are sales of that commodity, unless rental or leasing of that commodity is listed separately in the Permitted Use Schedule. 
                  d.  If an industrial plant or facility involves two (2) (or more) manufacturing activities with different SIC codes on the same zone lot, the industrial plant shall be permitted only in those zoning districts where the more restricted activity is permitted. (For example, an industrial plant preparing canned peanuts and also manufacturing the cans is allowed in those zoning districts permitting can manufacturing.) 
                  5.3-3 Mixed Uses. Two (2) or more permitted uses may occupy the same principal building. 
                  5.3-4 Prohibited Uses. Within certain overlay districts, some uses may be prohibited or additional requirements apply, regardless of the uses permitted in the underlying zoning district(s). The following Overlay Districts impose additional requirements to underlying zoning districts: 
                  a.  Historic Neighborhood Overlay District [Article 11]. 
                  b.  Highway 29 Overlay District [Article 4].

With application for a new site, if at any time during the process this escrow account has a balance less than $2,500.00, the Applicant shall immediately, upon notification by the City, replenish said escrow account so that it has a balance of at least $5,000.00. 
                  With application for a co-location, if at any time during the process this escrow account has a balance less than $1,500.00, the Applicant shall immediately, upon notification by the City, replenish said escrow account so that it has a balance of at least $3,000.00. Such additional escrow funds shall be deposited with the City before any further action or consideration is taken on the Application. 
                  In the event that the amount held in escrow by the City is more than the amount of the actual invoicing at the conclusion of the project, the remaining balance shall, upon request of the Applicant, be promptly refunded to the Applicant. If notified by the Town that additional escrow is required, the Applicant may request copies of Consultants' and/or experts' invoices. If the Applicant finds errors in those invoices, Applicant may ask the Town to audit those specific items for reasonableness, and may request relief therefrom if not deemed reasonable by the Town. 
                  c.  The foregoing does not prohibit the City from imposing additional reasonable and cost based fees for costs incurred should an applicant amend or change its application and the fee cap shall not apply as to any fees which the City determines to be attributable to the dilatory or otherwise bad faith actions of Applicant in providing a complete application or in proceeding with a public hearing. 
                  d.  The total amount of the funds needed as set forth in subsection (B) of this section may vary with the scope and complexity of the project, the completeness of the Application and other information as may be needed to complete the necessary review, analysis and inspection of any construction or modification.

                  The Mayor and Council find that signs provide an important medium through which individuals may convey a variety of messages. However, left completely unregulated, signs can become a threat to public safety as a traffic hazard and detriment to property values and the City's overall public welfare and economic growth as an aesthetic nuisance. See, e.g., Scenic America, Billboards and Sign Control available at http://www.scenic.org. 
                  By enacting this ordinance, the Mayor and Council intend to: 
                  a.  Balance the rights of individuals to convey their messages through signs and the right of the public to be protected against the unrestricted proliferation of signs; 
                  b.  Protect the public health, safety, and welfare; 
                  c.  Improve traffic and pedestrian safety; 
                  d.  Maintain and enhance the visual image of the City; 
                  e.  Protect property values by minimizing the possible adverse effects and visual blight caused by signs; 
                  f.  To promote the purposes stated in this section by regulating signs based on objective standards, including, but not limited to height and size, and without regard to the content of the sign message; 
                  g.  Promote economic development; and 
                  h.  Ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign regulations. 
                  14.1-1  The City also finds the following. 
                  a.  There is a substantial difference between signs erected by public authority and signs erected by private citizens or businesses. Signs erected by public authority are virtually all erected for the purpose of maintaining the public safety either through direct control of traffic or through provision of such type signage as street signs which enable the traveling public to know where they are located and to find where they are going. As such, with the exception of signs identifying government buildings, virtually all government signs are erected purely for public safety purposes. Moreover, their use in the public right-of-way is necessary to ensure their visibility to the motoring public. The City finds that public utility signs are frequently of the same nature as those signs erected by governmental entities in that they provide necessary information to safeguard the public from downed power lines and from street excavations. Even where signs serve a propriety purpose, such as identifying markings on utility poles, those signs are marked primarily for the purpose of benefiting the public generally through identification of locations where there may be temporary losses of power. 
                  b.  Some signage has a single targeted function and identification of such signage by description is impossible without referring to its function. For instance, address numerals are used for the sole purpose of locating addresses, which is of benefit to persons looking for those addresses and is essential to public safety personnel responding to emergencies. While such signage is referenced based upon the function it serves within the context of this chapter, the provisions of this chapter are unrelated to the content of the speech provided and allow maximum expressive potential to sign owners.

                  [Sec.] 16.12.100. - Reserve strips. 
                  Reserve strips controlling access to streets, alleys, and public grounds shall not be permitted unless their control is placed in the hands of the city council, under conditions approved by the planning commission. 
                  (Prior Code, § 16.12.100; Ord. No. 668, § SR3-10, 5-13-1996) 
                  [Sec.] 16.12.110. - Easements. 
                  A.  Utility Lines. Easements having a minimum width of ten (10) feet and located along the side or rear lot lines shall be provided as required for utility lines. 
                  B.  Drainage. Where a subdivision is traversed by a sanitary sewer or piped storm sewer, there shall be provided a public maintenance easement of adequate width. 
                  C.  Public Service Access. In townhouse and attached-dwelling subdivisions, easements contiguous with common areas and such other easements as are determined to be necessary by the city shall be provided to assure access to each lot for provision of public services and other services provided by franchise from the city. 
                  (Prior Code, § 16.12.110; Ord. No. 668, § SR3-11, 5-13-1996) 
                  [Sec.] 16.12.115. - Sidewalks. 
                  In each new subdivision that requires the construction of new streets, sidewalks must also be installed. The sidewalks must meet the construction standards set forth in the Coweta County regulations for subdivision sidewalks. The developer will be responsible for the construction of the installation of the sidewalks. 
                  (Prior Code, § 16.12.115; Ord. No. 725, 1-26-2004) 
                  [Sec.] 16.12.120. - Improvements required. 
                  A.  Required. Every subdivider shall be required to install or to have installed by the appropriate agency at his expense the following street improvements and utilities: 
                  1.  Except where waived on major or limited access streets by provisions of this or other ordinances, provide street grading, curbs and gutters, and street paving; provided that on a parkway, curb and gutter may be waived adjacent to the median or on the outside edges of the pavement or both, where hydrologic analysis indicates that the design storm specified by the city will be absorbed in the median or in rights-of-way outside the pavement without erosion damage or harm to landscaping, aesthetics, or the public health or safety. 
                  2.  Provide water lines and fire hydrants, sanitary sewer lines and manholes, sidewalks (when determined by the planning commission to be essential for the safety of pedestrians), and monuments and markers. 
                  3.  Provide storm drainage facilities, including catchbasins, junction boxes, and storm sewer lines discharging directly into existing storm sewers or continuous streams. (Discharge to overland flow, artificial channels, or intermittent streams—normally flowing only in direct response to precipitation—is not permitted.) Where no such discharge points for a particular drainage basin exist within the boundary of the property to be developed, discharge to intermittent streams may occur at or within ten (10) feet of such boundary. Where necessary because of inadequate capacity in existing facilities, erosion problems, or adverse impact on adjoining property, detention structures or energy-dissipation structures shall be provided. 
                  4.  On townhouse and attached-dwelling lots, provide for underground service for electric power, telephones, cable television and similar services. No overhead service will be permitted. 
                  B.  Standards. The foregoing street improvements, utilities and monuments shall be built to the standards specified by the agency responsible for each. 
                  C.  Completion. The city council's certificate necessary for final plat approval shall not be granted until: 
                  1.  All improvements required in subsection A have been completed; or 
                  2.  All improvements required in subsections A.2 and A.3 of this section and all street grading, curbs and gutters, and street base have been completed; and 
                  3.  A bond has been deposited with the city clerk for any required improvements not yet completed or for any necessary minor repairs or minor changes to improvements already in place. 
                  All improvements must be completed within nine months after approval of the final plat. Upon final acceptance of all improvements, funds in such deposit or account shall be returned to the depositor. 
                  D.  Public Improvements Bond. Where improvements constructed by a private developer are to be dedicated to the public, the developer shall, upon completion of construction, provide a bond to assure the structural durability, stability, and integrity of the improvements for one year from the date of acceptance by the city. Upon determination after one year that durability, stability, and integrity requirements have been met, the bond shall be released or returned to the depositor. As an alternative to providing a bond for one year, the developer may submit documentation by an engineering testing firm acceptable to the city, certifying that subgrade conditions, construction, and materials meet the city's standards. The certification shall be based on the level of testing specified by the city. 
                  (Prior Code, § 16.12.120; Ord. No. 668, § SR3-12, 5-13-1996) 
                  Sec. 16.12.130. - Monuments. 
                  The subdivider shall place permanent reference monuments in the subdivision, as required in this chapter and as approved by a registered land surveyor. Except as noted below, monuments shall be of stone or concrete, not less than thirty (30) inches in length, not less than four inches square or five inches in diameter, and marked on top with a cross, brass plug, iron rod, or other durable material securely embedded; or by iron rods or pipes at least thirty (30) inches long and two inches in diameter. Monuments shall be set flush with the ground and planted in such a manner that they will not be removed by frost. Monuments shall be properly set in the ground and approved by a registered land surveyor prior to the time the planning commission recommends approval of the final plat. 
                  A.  Street Rights-of-Way. Monuments shall be located on street right-of-way lines at street intersections and at each end of all curves. They shall be spaced so as to be within sight of each other, the sight lines being contained wholly within the street limits. 
                  B.  External Boundaries. The external boundaries of a subdivision shall be monumented. These monuments shall be placed at all corners, at each end of all curves, at the point where a curve changes its radius, at all angle points in any line, and at all angle points along the meander line, such points to be not less than twenty (20) feet back from the bank of any stream, except that when such corners or points fall within a street, or proposed future street, the monuments shall be placed in the side line of the street. 
                  C.  Internal Boundaries. All internal boundaries and those corners and points not referred to in subsection B of this section shall be monumented in the field by iron pipes at least seven-eighths inch in diameter or by iron bars at least one-half inch in diameter. These monuments shall be placed at all lot corners, at each end of all curves, at a point where a curve changes its radius, and at all angle points in any line. 
                  D.  Lines Extending to Streams. The lines of lots that extend to streams shall be monumented in the field by iron pipes at least seven-eights inch in diameter or by iron bars at least one-half inch in diameter. These monuments shall be placed at the point of intersection of the stream lot line, with a meander line established not less than twenty (20) feet back from the bank of the stream. 
                  (Prior Code, § 16.12.130; Ord. No. 668, § SR3-13, 5-13-1996) 
                  Sec. 16.12.140. - Addressing and building numbers. 
                  A.  Street addressing. Prior to final plat approval, street numbers shall be submitted by the subdivider and, if appropriate, approved by the engineer or his designee. A number shall be assigned to all primary buildings and structures according to the following standards: 
                  1.  For corner lots, or those lots having multiple street frontages, an address shall be assigned for each street meeting the minimum required street frontage. The person who constructs a building or structure on a corner lot shall designate a street number on the building permit from among the numbers assigned on the final plat. All other permits issued for the corner lot shall identify this number as the street address. 
                  2.  The driveway and mailbox shall be located onto the street assigned the number on the final plat. If in the opinion of the director the driveway leading to the building or structure is moved to the extent that the number no longer corresponds to the street number provided on the final plat, the final plat must be modified. No inspection shall be made under these circumstances and no certificate of occupancy shall be issued until the final plat is modified. 
                  B.  Building numbering. 
                  1.  Assigning numbers. Street numbers for the addressing system shall be assigned for all buildings and structures. Numbers must be erected and displayed in front of the project on a board with permanent numbers not smaller than two inches. Numbers must be in place at the beginning of the job before the footing inspection is made and must correspond to the address provided on building permit. The number shall be continuously displayed thereafter until the job is complete and all final inspections have been made. No inspection will be made where street numbers are not in place as required above. 
                  2.  Designation of street numbers. Street numbers for dwelling units and places of business on all public streets and street numbers or building numbers for dwelling units and places of business within apartment projects and nonresidential developments located on private streets shall be assigned by the City Clerk or designee in accordance with administrative procedures. 
                  3.  Posting. 
                  a.  Each one-family and two-family dwelling unit constructed after January 1, 2014, shall have posted and maintained in a conspicuous place on the property, visible from the street providing general public access, the address of such dwelling unit in figures at least three inches high on a contrasting background. 
                  b.  Each one-family and two-family dwelling unit constructed prior to January 1, 2014, shall have posted and maintained in a conspicuous place on the property, visible from the street providing general public access, the address of such dwelling unit in figures at least three inches high on a contrasting background. 
                  c.  Each multifamily (three or more dwelling units) building shall have posted and maintained in a conspicuous place on the building, visible from the parking lot or street providing general public access, the address(es) or number(s) of the building in figures at least six inches high on a contrasting background and each individual apartment/unit within the building shall be marked on or about its main entrance with the individual apartment/unit number and/or address in figures at least three inches high on a contrasting background. In addition to the above, where a multifamily building has more than one exterior entrance, each such entrance shall be marked, in figures at least three inches high on contrasting background, with the numbers and/or address of each and every individual apartment/unit to which access is provided through that common entrance. This shall be effective on all new and existing units January 1, 2014. 
                  d.  Each place of business and other non-residential occupied buildings shall have posted and maintained in a conspicuous place on the property, visible from the street providing general public access, the address of the place in figures at least three inches high on a contrasting background. When a building utilizes multiple addresses, such as multiple occupant mercantile buildings, the address range shall be posted. This shall be effective on all new and existing places of business January 1, 2014.
