PREFACE

        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACEThis Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Oglethorpe, Georgia.
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1986 Code and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council.
The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note
indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables
appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1986 Code and any ordinance included herein.
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have
been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been
included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code.
Chapter and Section Numbering System
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes.
Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure
after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the
first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be
inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that
would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and
new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the
subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be
assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be
taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters.
Page Numbering System
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which
represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In
the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to
the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of
ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of
which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government
officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves that stand as guideposts to direct the user
to the particular item in which the user is interested.
Looseleaf Supplements
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this
system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or
pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of
inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages.
Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received,
it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is
strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and,
in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.
Acknowledgments
This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Senior Code Attorney, and K. Barrington, Editor, of the
Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere
interest and able assistance throughout the project.
The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Shirley Lashley, City Clerk, and Mr. Jon Cooggle, City Attorney, for cooperation and assistance
during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of
Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day
administration of the city's affairs.

                  of ten percent but not less than $10.00 shall be added, and after the due date such taxes shall be subject to interest at the rate of seven

                  by Georgia law governing sales and transfers of tax fi. fas. Provided that, upon levy of execution and sale of property pursuant to such

                  If a new section not heretofore existing in the Code is to be added, the following language may be used: "The Code of the
                  City of Oglethorpe, Georgia, is hereby amended by adding a section (or chapter, article, division or subdivision, as
                  appropriate) to be numbered ____________, that reads as follows:â¦." The new material may then be set out in full as
                  desired.
                  All sections, subdivisions, divisions, articles or chapters desired to be repealed should be specifically repealed by section,

                  or regulation authorized by ordinance.
                  In this section, the term "violation of this Code" does not include the failure of a city officer or city employee to perform
                  an official duty, unless it is provided that failure to perform the duty is to be punished as provided in this section or it is
                  clear from the context that it is the intent to impose the penalty provided for in this section upon the officer or employee.
                  Except as otherwise provided:
                  A person convicted of a violation of this Code shall be punished by a fine not to exceed $500.00, or by labor on the
                  streets or public works of the city under the control and discretion of the proper officers, not to exceed 30 days, or

                  combination thereof.

                  separate offense.

                  administrative sanctions.
                  Violations of this Code that are continuous with respect to time are a public nuisance and may be abated by injunctive or
                  other equitable relief and by such other means as are provided by law. The imposition of a penalty does not prevent

                  Grounds. The following shall be considered just cause for suspension or revocation of any license issued hereunder:
                  The performance of any act prohibited by this article or the failure to perform any act required by this article as well
                  as the violation of any state, local or federal law, particularly, but not limited to, those involving alcoholic beverages;
                  if such violation tends to indicate that the licensee will not maintain the operation of the business licensed in
                  conformity with state, local or federal laws. If such act, omission or violation is done by any agent, servant,
                  employee, or officer of the licensee, the lack of knowledge on that part of the licensee or the lack of authorization
                  for such act or omission or violation shall be no defense.
                  The entry of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, or the conviction of any licensee, partner, or any officer of a
                  licensee corporation, with respect to a charge or violation of any of the laws of the state or the United States or any

                  motion for rehearing, except after a grant thereof by the council. If the matter of which complaint is made is not the
                  subject of a prior hearing at which the protestant was permitted to be present and heard, the council shall afford a
                  hearing within ten days after the filing of the motion, of which three days' written notice shall be given to the protestant,

                  The warrant describes, either directly or by reference to the affidavit, the property upon which the inspection is to
                  occur and is sufficiently accurate that the executor of the warrant and the owner or possessor of the property can
                  reasonably determine from it the property for which the warrant authorizes an inspection.
                  The warrant indicates the conditions, objects, activities, or circumstances which the inspection is intended to check
                  or reveal.

                  other relevant regulation of the city, any further proceedings against the interested parties and/or the property shall be conducted in
                  accordance with the provisions of section 8-62. In addition thereto, the department may, in addition to other remedies, issue a citation

                  the interested parties for such property, dwelling, building, or structure, if the officer determines from investigation or
                  inspection that any dwelling, building, structure, or property is:
                  Unfit for human habitation or for commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable
                  codes;
                  Is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or

                  Results of hearing for cases involving structures. If after such notice and hearing the court determines that the dwelling, bui
                  structure in question is unfit for human habitation or is unfit for its current commercial, industrial, or business use and not i
                  compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitute
                  endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions; or that there exist on the proper
                  conditions which are in violation of this article or other relevant ordinances of the city, the court shall state in writing finding
                  support of such determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the interested parties that have answered the co
                  appeared at the hearing an order:
                  In cases involving structures or buildings on the property, if the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said
                  dwelling, building, or structure can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling,
                  building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order: to repair, alter, or improve such
                  dwelling, building, or structure so as to bring it into full compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited
                  violation and, if applicable, to secure the structure so that it cannot be used in connection with the commission of
                  drug crimes; or
                  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure in order to bring it into full
                  compliance with applicable codes relevant to the cited violations cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to
                  the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order:
                  to demolish and remove said dwelling, building, or structure and all debris from the property.
                  For purposes of these two subsections, the court shall make its determination of reasonable cost in relation to the present
                  value of the dwelling, building, or structure without consideration of the value of the land on which the structure is situated;
                  provided, however, that costs of the preparation necessary to repair, alter, or improve a structure may be considered. The
                  income and financial status of the owner shall not be a factor in the court's determination. The present value of the
                  structure and the costs of repair, alteration, or improvement may be established by affidavits of real estate appraisers with
                  a state appraiser classification as provided in O.C.G.A. Â§ 43-39A-1 et seq., qualified building contractors, or qualified building
                  inspectors without actual testimony presented. Costs of repair, alteration, or improvement of the structure shall be the cost
                  necessary to bring the structure into compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violations in force in the
                  jurisdiction.
                  Results of hearings not involving structures. In cases involving violations other than buildings or structures on the
                  property, the court shall order the owner or other person before the court to abate the condition by mowing, cutting, or
                  removal, as the case may be.
                  Enforcement personnel not liable. No officer or member of the city council or employee of the city, charged with the
                  enforcement of this article in the discharge of duties, shall be rendered liable personally; and such officer, member, or
                  employee is hereby relieved from all personal liability for any damage that may accrue to persons or property as a result
                  of any act required or permitted in the discharge of duties under this article.
                  Failure to comply with court order. If the owner or other person before the court fails to comply with an order to repair or
                  demolish the dwelling, building, or structure, or to abate the condition, as the case may be, the public officer may cause
                  such dwelling, building, or structure, to be repaired, altered, or improved, to be vacated and closed, and/or demolished,
                  or the conditions existing in violation abated as provided in said order. Such abatement action shall commence within
                  270 days after the expiration of the time specified in the order for abatement by the owner. Any time during which such
                  action is prohibited by a court order issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. Â§ 41-2-13 or any other equitable relief granted by a court
                  of competent jurisdiction shall not be counted toward the 270 days in which such abatement action must commence. The
                  public officer shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of the building, dwelling, or structure a placard with the
                  following words:
                  "This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business use and does not comply with the
                  applicable codes or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with drug crimes or constitutes an
                  endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or occupation of this
                  building is prohibited and unlawful."
                  Salvage of materials from demolition; city and officer not liable. If the public officer has the structure demolished,

                  reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of
                  any moneys received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and
                  removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of
                  salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. The public officer and the city are
                  relieved of any and all liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without
                  limitation, defects in such salvaged materials.
                  Costs of demolition/abatement a lien against the property. The amount of the cost of demolition, including all court costs,
                  appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the city, and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement
                  action, including restoration to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be a lien against the real property upon
                  which such cost was incurred.
                  Filing, recording, status of liens. The lien provided for in the foregoing subsection shall attach to the real property
                  upon the filing of a certified copy of the order requiring repair, closure, demolition, or other abatement in the office
                  of the clerk of the county superior court and shall relate back to the date of the filing of the lis pendens notice
                  required under section 8-64. The clerk of the county superior court, as required by O.C.G.A. Â§ 41-2-9(b)(1), shall
                  record and index such certified copy of the order in the county deed records and shall enter the lien on the general
                  execution docket. The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except liens for taxes to which the lien
                  shall be inferior, and shall continue in force until paid.
                  Determination of amount of lien; collection. Upon final determination of costs, fees, and expenses incurred in
                  accordance with this article, the public officer responsible for enforcement actions under this article shall transfer to
                  the city tax collector a statement of the total amount due and secured by said lien, together with copies of all
                  notices provided to interested parties. The statement of the public officer shall be transmitted within 90 days of
                  completion of the repairs, demolition, closure, or other action. It shall be the duty of the city tax collector to collect
                  the amount of the lien using all methods available for collecting real property ad valorem taxes, including
                  specifically O.C.G.A. Â§ 48-4-1 et seq.; provided, however, that the limitation of O.C.G.A Â§ 48-4-78 which requires 12
                  months of delinquency before commencing any tax foreclosure shall not apply. The city tax collector shall remit the
                  amount collected to the city.
                  Enforcement of liens; penalties. Enforcement of liens pursuant to this article may be initiated at any time following
                  receipt by the city tax collector of the final determination of costs in accordance with this article. The unpaid lien
                  amount shall bear interest and penalties from and after the date of final determination of costs in the same amount
                  as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes. An enforcement proceeding
                  pursuant to O.C.G.A. Â§ 48-4-78 for delinquent ad valorem taxes may include all amounts due under this chapter.
                  Redemption. The redemption amount in any enforcement proceeding pursuant to this article shall be the full
                  amount of the costs as finally determined in accordance with this article together with interest, penalties, and costs
                  incurred by the governing authority and/or the city tax collector in the enforcement of such lien. Redemption of
                  property from the lien may be made in accordance with the provisions of O.C.G.A. Â§Â§ 48-4-80 and 48-4-81.
                  Waiver and release of lien. The city may waive and release any such lien imposed on property upon the owner of
                  such property entering into a contract with the county or municipality agreeing to a timetable for rehabilitation of
                  the real property or the dwelling, building, or structure on the property and demonstrating the financial means to
                  accomplish such rehabilitation.
                  Review as provided by statute. Review of a court order requiring the repair, alteration, improvement, or demolition of a
                  dwelling, building, or structure shall be by direct appeal as provided in O.C.G.A. Â§ 5-3-29.
                  Citations may precede complaint. The public officers designated herein may, in addition to the powers herein granted,
                  issue citations for violations of state minimum standard codes, option building, fire, life safety, and other codes adopted
                  by ordinance, and conditions creating a public health hazard or general nuisance, and may seek to enforce such citation
                  in a court of competent jurisdiction prior to issuing a complaint in rem as provided in this article.
                  City's powers regarding nuisances and abatement not affected. Nothing in this article shall be construed to impair or limit
                  in any way the power of the city to define and declare nuisances and to cause their removal or abatement by summary

                  The following words, terms, and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except
                  where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
                  Aquifer means any stratum (rock layer) or zone of rock beneath the surface of the earth capable of containing or producing water
                  from a well.
                  Groundwater recharge area (aquifer recharge area) means an area of the earth's surface where water infiltrates the ground,
                  thereby replenishing the groundwater supplies within an aquifer.
                  Pollution susceptibility means the relative vulnerability of groundwater to pollution from chemical spills, leaching of pollutants from
                  dump sites, animal waste from agricultural operations or pollution generated by other human activities.
                  Pollution susceptibility map means a map, prepared by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources (DNR) that shows the relative
                  susceptibility of groundwater to pollution. Pollution susceptibility maps categorize the land areas of the state into areas of high, medium
                  and low groundwater pollution potential.
                  Significant groundwater recharge areas means areas mapped by DNR in Hydrologic Atlas 18, (1989 edition. Mapping of recharge
                  areas is based on outcrop area, lithology (chemical nature and form of rock), soil type and thickness, slope, density of lithologic contacts,

                  Findings of fact.
                  In order to provide for the health, safety and welfare of the public and to promote a healthy economic climate in the
                  city and surrounding communities, it is essential that public drinking water resources of high quality be ensured. For
                  this reason, it is necessary to protect the subsurface water resources that the city and surrounding communities
                  rely on as sources of public water.
                  Groundwater resources are contained within aquifers, which are permeable rock strata occupying vast regions of
                  the subsurface. These aquifers are replenished by infiltration of surface water runoff in zones of the surface known
                  as groundwater recharge areas. Groundwater is susceptible to contamination when unrestricted development

                  occurs within significant groundwater recharge areas. It is, therefore, necessary to manage land use within
                  groundwater recharge areas to ensure that pollution threats to water resources are minimized.
                  Objectives. The objectives of this article are:
                  Protect groundwater quality by restricting land uses that generate, use, or store dangerous pollutants in recharge
                  areas;
                  Protect groundwater quality by limiting density of development; and
                  Protect groundwater quality by ensuring that any development that occurs within the recharge area shall have no
                  adverse effect on groundwater quality.

                  Sec. 14-119. - Findings of fact.
                  Wetlands are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding,
                  erosion and soils limitations. In its natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide:
                  Habitat for fish, wildlife, and vegetation;
                  Water quality maintenance and pollution control;
                  Flood control;
                  Erosion control;
                  Natural resource education;
                  Scientific study; and
                  Open space and recreational opportunities.

                  In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well-being of many communities within
                  the State of Georgia.
                  Nationally, a considerable number of wetland resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling,
                  excavating, building, pollution and other acts. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general
                  welfare. It is, therefore, necessary to discourage development activities that may adversely affect wetlands by ensuring
                  maximum protection for wetlands located in the corporate limits of the city.

                  Sec. 14-120. - Title and purpose.
                  The purpose of this article is to promote wetland protection, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development,
                  recreational and aesthetic values. Activities that may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree
                  practicable as determined through a permitting process. The objective of this article is to protect wetlands from alterations that will
                  significantly affect or reduce their primary functions for water quality, floodplain and erosion control, groundwater recharge, aesthetic
                  nature, and wildlife habitat.

                  The county board of tax assessors shall consider wetland regulations in determining the fair market value of land. Any owner of an
                  undeveloped wetland who has dedicated an easement or entered into a conservation program with the government or a nonprofit
                  organization restricting activities in a wetland shall have that portion of land assessed consistent with those restrictions. Such landowner
                  shall also be exempted from special assessment on the wetland to defray the cost of municipal improvements such as sanitary sewers,
                  storm sewers, and water mains.

                  These regulations and the generalized wetland map may from time to time be amended in accordance with procedures and
                  requirements in the general statutes and as new information concerning wetland locations, soils, hydrology, flooding, or plant species
                  peculiar to wetlands becomes available.

                  Any application for subdivision approval shall include a jurisdictional determination approved by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
                  If the Corps determines that wetlands are present and that a Section 404 Permit or Letter of Permission is required, subdivision
                  approval will be issued only following issuance of the Section 404 Permit or Letter of Permission.

                  required under this article, and may take or cause to be made such examinations, surveys, or sampling as the permitting
                  officer deems necessary.
                  The permitting officer shall have authority to enter the subject site to monitor development and to enforce this
                  article; issue permits hereunder; and address violations or threatened violations hereof by issuance of violation
                  notices, administrative orders and civil and criminal actions. All costs, fees and expenses in connection with such
                  actions may be recovered as damages against the violator.
                  Law enforcement officials or other officials having police powers in the jurisdiction shall have authority to assist the
                  permitting officer with enforcement.
                  The permitting officer shall have authority to issue cease and desist orders in the event of any violation of this
                  article. Cease and desist orders may be appealed to a court of competent jurisdiction, as identified herein.
                  The permitting officer may require a bond with surety and conditions sufficient to secure compliance with the conditions
                  set forth in the permit. The particular amount and the conditions of the bond shall be consistent with the purposes of
                  this article. In the event of a breach of any condition of any such bond, the permitting officer may institute an action in a
                  court of competent jurisdiction upon such bond and prosecute the same to judgment and execution.
                  When the permitting officer determines a building or other structure has been constructed in violation of this article, the
                  violator may, at the discretion of the permitting officer, be required to remove the structure.
                  When removal of vegetative cover, excavation or fill has taken place in violation of this article, the violator may, at the
                  discretion of the permitting officer and as far as practicable, be required to restore the affected land to its original
                  contours and to restore vegetation.
                  Suspension, revocation. The permitting officer may suspend or revoke a permit if he finds the applicant has not complied
                  with the conditions or limitations set forth in the permit or has exceeded the scope of the work set forth in the permit.
                  The permitting officer shall cause notice of denial, issuance, conditional issuance, revocation or suspension of a permit to
                  be published in a daily newspaper having a broad circulation in the areas where the wetland is located.

                  Sec. 14-172. - Local development permit requirements.
                  No regulated activity will be allowed within the wetland protection district without written permission from the permitting officer in
                  the form of a local development permit. Issuance of a local development permit is contingent on full compliance with the terms of this
                  article and other applicable regulations. All activities that are not identified in section 14-209 shall be prohibited without prior issuance
                  of a local development permit. If the area proposed for development appears to be located within 50 feet of the wetland protection
                  district boundary, as determined by the permitting officer from review of the Generalized Wetland Map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
                  determination shall be required. If the Corps determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site and that a
                  Section 404 Permit or Letter of Permission is required, a local development permit will be issued only following receipt by the local
                  permitting officer of a copy of the Section 404 Permit or Letter of Permission issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

                  A temporary, emergency permit can be issued by the permitting officer for the following reasons:
                  Maintenance or repair of lawfully located roads or structures and of facilities used in the service of the public to
                  provide transportation, electric, gas, water, telephone, telegraph, telecommunication, or other services; provided
                  such roads, structures, or facilities are not materially changed or enlarged, and written notice prior to the
                  commencement of work has been given to the permitting officer; and provided the work is conducted using best
                  management practices to ensure that flow and circulation patterns and chemical and biological characteristics of
                  the wetland are not impaired, and that any adverse effect on the aquatic environment will be minimized.
                  Temporary water-level stabilization measures associated with ongoing silvicultural operations.
                  Limited ditching, tilling, dredging, excavating, or filling done solely for the purpose of maintaining or repairing
                  existing drainage systems necessary for the cultivation of agricultural crops; provided the maintenance or repair
                  activity does not result in the impairment, alteration or loss of wetlands not previously subject to agricultural and
                  silvicultural use under the terms and provisions of section 14-209
                  Limited excavating and filling necessary for the repair and maintenance of piers, walkways, nature trails,
                  observation decks, wildlife management shelters, boathouses, or other similar water-related structures; provided
                  such facilities and structures are built on pilings to allow unobstructed flow of water and preserve the natural
                  contour of the wetland.

                  At the time of the application, the applicant shall pay a filing fee specified by the permitting officer. Filing fees in the amount
                  established by the city shall be required to evaluate the application. However, if after review of the initial application it is determined
                  that expert consultants are necessary to provide services pertaining to functional assessment, mitigation and wetland boundary
                  determination, those fees will be in excess of the filing fee.

                  permitting officer's determination that the application submitted is complete. The review period shall include the preparation of findings
                  (approval, conditional approval or disapproval) by the permitting officer. The applicant will receive written notification of the findings of
                  the permitting officer. If outside consultants are required, the process will be completed in a timely fashion, but may exceed the sevenday review period established herein.

                  appeal must be submitted in writing to the city clerk within ten days of the decision rendered by the permitting officer. A
                  public hearing shall be held by the city council for appeals. Public announcement of the hearing shall be printed in a local
                  newspaper of general circulation at least 15 days but not more than 45 days prior to the hearing. Any person may offer
                  testimony at the hearing. The decision of the city council shall be issued within 15 days of the public hearing and may be
                  appealed to the county superior court.

                  Sec. 14-208. - Division application and boundaries.
                  Application. This division shall apply to all lands within wetlands located in the corporate limits of the city. The
                  generalized wetland map, adopted as part of this chapter, shows the general location of wetlands and should be
                  consulted by persons contemplating activities in or near wetlands. The generalized wetland map, together with all
                  explanatory matter thereon and attached thereto, is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be part of this article.
                  The generalized wetland map shall be on file at city hall.
                  Boundaries. The generalized wetland map is a general reference document, and wetland boundaries indicated on the
                  map are approximations. The purpose of the generalized wetland map is to alert developers/landowners that a subject
                  site may be in a jurisdictional wetland or in proximity to a jurisdictional wetland, requiring the developer/landowner to
                  seek U.S. Army Corps of Engineers guidance as to whether a Section 404 permit will be required prior to initiation of any
                  development activity on the subject site. The generalized wetland map does not represent precise boundaries of
                  jurisdictional wetlands within the city, and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the
                  U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government
                  action under this division does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements.

                  including laws of trespass, and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining or dredging, except as provided herein:
                  Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish and other wildlife, provided they do not affect waters of
                  the state or of the United States in such a way that would require an individual Section 404 permit.
                  Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, birdwatching, hiking, boating, horseback riding and
                  canoeing.
                  Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the state forestry
                  commission and as specified in Section 404 of the Clean Water Act.
                  The continued cultivation of agricultural crops. Agricultural activities shall; however, be subject to best management
                  practices approved by the state department of agriculture.

                  plan. The site plan may be amended only with approval of the permitting officer. The permitting officer may require additional

                  Any subdivision that includes jurisdictional wetlands shall be allowed and encouraged to use the following options:
                  Lot size averaging. Lot size averaging is encouraged in single-family detached subdivisions as a means to work
                  around wetland areas. The planning and zoning commission may allow a reduction in lot size provided the same
                  number of lots in the same subdivision are oversized by an equal or greater area. The maximum permissible
                  reduction shall not exceed 25 percent of the minimum required lot area. The number of lots with areas reduced
                  shall not exceed 25 percent of the total number of lots in the subdivision. The permitting officer shall allow no more
                  than a 25 percent adjustment of rear, side, and front setbacks for each affected lot.
                  Cluster development. Clustering of residential development is encouraged. When considering subdivision approval,
                  the planning and zoning commission may allow incorporation of wetland or other significant natural areas as open
                  space in the subdivision plan. Such plans should designate at least 25 percent of the gross land area as open space.

                  used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "mobile home" does not include
                  recreational vehicles or travel trailers.
                  Start of construction includes (for other than new construction of substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources
                  Act (Pub. L 97-348)) substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of
                  construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The term "actual start" means the first
                  placement of permanent construction of a structure (other than a mobile home) on site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings or any
                  work beyond the stage of excavation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as, clearing, grading, and filling;
                  nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or
                  foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as, garages
                  or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not as part of the main structure. For a structure (other than a mobile home) without a

                  thereof on its piling or foundation. For mobile homes not within a mobile home park or mobile home subdivision, the term "actual start"
                  means the affixing of the mobile home to its permanent site. For mobile homes within mobile home parks or mobile home subdivisions,
                  the actual start is the date on which the construction facilities for servicing the site on which the mobile home is to be affixed (including
                  at a minimum the construction of streets, either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads, and installation of utilities) is
                  completed.
                  Substantial improvement means, for a structure built prior to the enactment of this article, any repair, reconstruction, or
                  improvement of a structure the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure either:
                  Before the improvement or repair is started; or
                  If the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred.
                  For the purposes of this definition, the term "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration on
                  any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the
                  external dimensions of the structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
                  which are solely necessary to ensure safe living conditions, or any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of
                  Historic Places or a state inventory of historic places.

                  Violation of the provisions of this article or failure to comply with any of its requirements including violation of conditions and
                  safeguards established in connection with grants of variance or special exceptions shall constitute a misdemeanor.

                  Sec. 18-21. - Findings of fact.
                  The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life, property, health, and
                  safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood
                  protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general
                  welfare.
                  These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights
                  and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other properties
                  which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage.

                  Sec. 18-22. - Statement of purpose.
                  It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses
                  due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
                  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, which
                  result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
                  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage
                  at the time of initial construction;
                  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in
                  the accommodation of floodwater;
                  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion of flood damage; and
                  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may

                  The degree of flood protection required by this article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific
                  and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or
                  natural causes. This article does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be
                  free from flooding or flood damages. This article shall not create liability on the part of the city or by any officer or employee thereof for
                  any flood damages that result from reliance on this article or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.

                  Designation of clerk. The city clerk is hereby appointed to administer and implement this article by granting or denying
                  development permit applications in accordance with its provisions. Duties of the city clerk shall include, but not be limited
                  to, the following:
                  Permit review.
                  Review all development permits to determine that the permit requirements of this article have been satisfied.
                  Advise permittee that additional federal or state permits may be required, and if specific federal or state
                  permits are known, require that copies of such permits be provided and maintained on file with the
                  development permit.
                  Review all development permits to determine if proposed development adversely affects the flood-carrying
                  capacity of the floodplain. For purposes of this article, the term "adversely affects" means damage to adjacent
                  properties because of rises in flood stages attributed to physical changes of the channel and the adjacent
                  overbank areas.
                  Determination.
                  If it is determined that there is not a building, then the permit shall be granted without further consideration.
                  If it is determined that there is an adverse effect, then technical justification (i.e., a professional engineering
                  analysis) for the proposed development shall be required.
                  If the proposed development is a building, then the provisions of this article shall apply.
                  Use of other flood data. When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with this article, then the
                  city clerk shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation data available from a federal, state, or other
                  source, in order to administer this article.
                  Information to be obtained and maintained.
                  The city clerk shall:
                  Verify and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the lowest floor (including basement) of
                  all new or substantially improved structures.
                  Verify and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which the new or substantially
                  improved structures have been floodproofed. Certification of such floodproofing shall be obtained in
                  accordance with this article.
                  All records pertaining to the provisions of this article shall be maintained in the office of the city clerk and shall be
                  open for public inspection.

                  watercourse, and shall submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Insurance Administration.
                  Require that maintenance is provided within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that the floodcarrying capacity is not diminished.
                  Interpretation of FHBM boundaries. Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of the boundaries of the
                  areas of special flood hazard (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual
                  physical conditions), the city clerk shall make the necessary interpretation.

                  tax, the person against whom the entry was made shall not be allowed or entitled to have or collect any fees or charges whatsoever for
                  services rendered after the entry of the nulla bona. If, at any time after the entry of nulla bona has been made, the person against
                  whom the execution issues pays the tax in full together with all interest and costs accrued on the tax, the person may collect any fees
                  and charges due him or her as though he or she had never defaulted in the payment of the taxes.

                  avenues, lanes, squares, and public grounds, as may be necessary to ensure public safety or to preserve or enhance the symmetry and
                  beauty of such public grounds. The city tree board may remove or cause to order to be removed, any tree or part thereof which is in an
                  unsafe condition or which by reason of its nature is injurious to sewers, electric power lines, gas lines, water lines, or other public
                  improvements, or is affected with any injurious fungus, insect, or other pest. This section does not prohibit the planting of street trees

                  crown to such a degree so as to remove the normal canopy and disfigure the tree. Trees severely damaged by storms or other causes,
                  or certain trees under utility wires or other obstructions where other pruning practices are impractical may be exempted from this
                  article at the determination of the city tree board.

                  decayed limbs which constitute a menace to the safety of the public. The city shall have the right to prune any tree or shrub on private
                  property when it interferes with the proper spread of light along the street from a streetlight or interferes with visibility of any traffic
                  control device or sign.

                  The city shall have the right to cause the removal of any dead or diseased trees on private property within the city, when such trees
                  constitute a hazard to life and property, or harbor insects or disease which constitute a potential threat to other trees within the city.
                  The city tree board will notify in writing the owners of such trees. Removal shall be done by said owners at the owners' own expense
                  within 60 days after the date of service of notice. In the event of failure of owners to comply with such provisions, the city shall have the
                  authority to remove such trees and charge the cost of removal on the owner's property tax notice.

                  Each location noted on the master address list for E911 shall be required to purchase an address sign as described
                  herein. The city shall bill the residents or owner of the business the sum in an amount established by the city for each
                  sign installed. The signs shall be installed on a metal post and metal sign with the display of official reflective address
                  numbers so that they are clearly visible from the street or road on which the driveway to the property is on. No other
                  signs will be allowed to be displayed. The following criteria shall be used to properly display the numbers:
                  Address numbers must meet the minimum size requirements indicated as follows:
                  Posts upon which they are mounted must bear reflective letters three inches in height.
                  Residences and businesses, in the incorporated areas of the city, must place posts bearing a blue sign with
                  white reflective address numbers three inches in height, and in immediate proximity to the driveway or private
                  road that leads to such residence or business.
                  Numbers for a multiple dwelling complex or nonresidential building shall be three inches in height and shall be
                  placed on a post. Individual units within a multiple dwelling complex shall be required to display a unit reflective
                  number, which is three inches in height on the front door or immediately adjacent to the door.
                  On a corner lot, the house number shall face the street named in the address.
                  The address program administrator and program assistant, with the concurrence of the mayor and council, will have the
                  right to authorize and approve alternate methods of displaying numbers which meet the intent of this article when strict
                  adherence to these standards cannot be met or is impractical.

                  Sec. 30-108. - Types of numbers.
                  The following two types of numbers are to be used under this article:
                  A primary number is to be assigned to each street frontage of each improved property. The primary number must
                  be posted on that property if the property is occupied by a dwelling unit; structure, or active use and the owner,
                  occupant, or person in charge is notified.
                  Secondary numbers may be used when a number of units, structures, and uses coexist on the same parcel of land.
                  Examples of secondary numbers include apartment projects, mobile home parks, office parks, planned unit
                  developments, recreational vehicle parks, recreational areas, shopping centers, and other uses where the use of
                  secondary numbers would clarify the location of a unit or use for public safety purposes. To provide secondary
                  numbers, the address program administrator shall work with the owner, manager, or person in charge of the
                  project to determine a logical numbering system.

                  The arrangement of streets in new subdivisions shall make provision for the direct continuation of the principle existing
                  streets in adjoining subdivisions (or their proper projection where adjoining property is not subdivided) insofar as they
                  may be necessary for public requirements. In general, such streets shall be a width at least at great as the existing
                  streets. The street and alley arrangement must also be such as to provide opportunity for access for any use by adjoining
                  property owners.
                  Wherever a street is stub-ended so that it will not at its end open into another street, an adequate turnaround, either
                  circular or Y-shaped, shall be provided.
                  No lots shall be subdivided nor indicated for sale as business or industrial lots, except at points designated for these uses

                  At important intersections and at all acute corners, the property corner shall be rounded or cut off.
                  Grades of streets shall be the lowest feasible and no grade shall be less than one half of one percent. Grades on local
                  streets dead-end streets and alleys shall not be in excess of 14 percent.
                  Whenever streets or alleys are paved or surfaced, such paving or surfacing shall be of a type and strength suitable for the
                  volume and character of traffic to be expected.
                  All improvements shall conform to the best engineering standards. Due consideration shall be given throughout to the
                  appearance of the subdivision and the various features thereof within its own boundaries and also in its environment in
                  the city.
                  Parks, playgrounds, school sites. In subdividing property, due consideration shall be given to the provision of

                  Bills to customers for water and sewer service shall be mailed out on such day of each month as may be determined as desirable by
                  the city. Bills shall be paid at the city hall and a failure to receive bills or notices shall not prevent such bills from becoming delinquent
                  nor relieve the consumer from payment of same. The failure of water and/or sewer users to pay charges duly imposed shall result in the
                  automatic imposition of the following penalties:
                  Nonpayment within 20 days from the due date will be subject to a penalty of ten percent of the delinquent account.
                  Nonpayment within 40 days from the due date will result in the water being shut off from the water user's property.
                  Nonpayment for 60 days after original due date will allow the city, in addition to all other rights and remedies, to
                  terminate agreement; and in such event, the water user shall not be entitled to receive, nor the city obligated to
                  supply, any water under this agreement.
                  Service disconnected for nonpayment of bills will be restored only after bills are paid in full, such security deposit as may be
                  required by the mayor and council is made, and a service charge, in the amount established by the city, paid for each meter
                  reconnected.

                  When water and sewer service is discontinued and all bills paid, the security deposit shall be refunded to the consumer by the city.
                  Upon discontinuance of service for nonpayment of bills, the security deposit will be applied by the city toward settlement of the account.
                  Any balance will be refunded to the consumer; however, if the security deposit is insufficient to cover the bill, the city may proceed to
                  collect the balance in the usual way provided by law for collection of debts. The city reserves a right to discontinue its service without
                  notice for the following additional reasons:
                  To prevent fraud or abuse.
                  Consumer's willful disregard of the city's rules.
                  Emergency repairs.
                  Insufficiency of water supply due to circumstances beyond the city's control.
                  Legal processes.

                  Sec. 36-52. - Complaints and adjustments.
                  If the consumer believes his bill to be in error, he shall present his claim, in person, at the city hall before the bill becomes
                  delinquent. Such claim, if made after the bill has become delinquent, shall not be effective in preventing discontinuance
                  of service as heretofore provided. The consumer may pay such bill under protest and said payment shall not prejudice
                  his claim.
                  The city will make a special water meter reading at the request of a consumer for a fee in the amount established by the
                  city; provided, however, that if such special reading discloses that the meter was over-read, no charge will be made.
                  Water meters will be tested at the request of the consumer upon payment to the city of the actual costs of making the
                  test; provided, however, that if the meter is found to over-register beyond three percent of the correct volume, no charge
                  will be made.
                  If the seal of a meter is broken by other than the city's representative or if the meter fails to register correctly or is
                  stopped for any cause, the consumer shall pay an amount estimated from the record of his previous bills and/or from
                  other proper data.

                  three-fourths-inch meter. A proportionately greater charge than the connection fee above will be made for a meter of
                  large dimensions.
                  The city may make connections to service other properties not adjacent to its lines upon payment of reasonable costs for

                  The city may also install its meter at or near the property line or, at the city's option, on the consumer's property within
                  three feet of the property line.
                  Furthermore, the city reserves the right to refuse service, unless the consumer's lines or pipings are installed in such a
                  manner as to prevent cross connections or backflow.

                  refusal and/or discontinuance of service.
                  Where a meter or meter box is placed on the premises of a consumer, a suitable place shall be provided by the consumer
                  therefor, unobstructed and accessible at all times to the meter reader.

                  Sec. 36-107. - Private sewage disposal.
                  Where a public sanitary or combined sewer is not available under provisions of section 36-106(d), the building sewer shall
                  be connected to a private sewage disposal system complying with the provisions of this article.
                  Before commencement of construction of a private sewage disposal system, the owner shall first obtain a written permit
                  signed by the superintendent. The application for such permit shall be made on a form furnished by the city, which the
                  applicant shall supplement by any plans, specifications, and other information as are deemed necessary by the
                  superintendent. A permit and inspection fee, in an amount established by the city, shall be paid to the city at the time the
                  application is filed.
                  A permit for a private sewage disposal system shall not become effective until the installation is completed to the
                  satisfaction of the superintendent. He shall be allowed to inspect the work at any stage of construction, and in any event,
                  the applicant for the permit shall notify the superintendent when the work is ready for final inspection, and before any
                  underground portions are covered. The inspection shall be made within 72 hours of the receipt of notice by the
                  superintendent.
                  The type, capacities, location, and layout of a private sewage disposal system shall comply with all recommendations of
                  the department of public health of the state. No permit shall be issued for any private sewage disposal system employing
                  subsurface soil absorption facilities where the area of the lot is less than 20,000 square feet. No septic tank or cesspool
                  shall be permitted to discharge to any natural outlet.
                  At such time as a public sewer becomes available to a property served by a private sewage disposal system as provided in
                  subsection (d) of this section, a direct connection shall be made to the public sewer in compliance with this article, and
                  any septic tanks, cesspools, and similar private sewage disposal facilities shall be abandoned and filled with suitable
                  material.
                  The owner shall operate and maintain the private sewage disposal facilities in a sanitary manner at all times, at no
                  expense to the city.
                  No statement contained in this article shall be construed to interfere with any additional requirements that may be
                  imposed by the health officer.
                  When a public sewer become available, the building sewer shall be connected to said sewer within 60 days, and the
                  private sewage disposal system shall be cleaned of sludge and filled with clean bank-run gravel or dirt.

                  Sec. 36-108. - Building sewers and connections.
                  No unauthorized person shall uncover, make any connections with or opening into, use, alter, or disturb any public sewer
                  or appurtenance thereof without first obtaining a written permit from the superintendent.
                  There shall be two classes of building sewer permits:
                  Residential and commercial; and
                  Establishments producing industrial wastes.
                  In either case, the owner or his agent shall make application on a special form furnished by the city. The permit
                  application shall be supplemented by any plans, specifications, or other information considered pertinent in the
                  judgment of the superintendent. A permit and inspection fee in an amount established by the city for a residential or
                  commercial building sewer permit and a fee in an amount established by the city for an industrial building sewer shall be
                  paid to the city at the time the application is filed.
                  All costs and expense incident to the installation and connection of the building sewer shall be borne by the owner. The

                  owner shall indemnify the city from any loss or damage that may directly or indirectly be occasioned by the installation of
                  the building sewer.
                  A separated and independent building sewer shall be provided for every building; except where one building stands at
                  the rear of another on an interior lot and no private sewer is available or can be constructed to the rear building through
                  an adjoining alley, court, yard, or driveway, the building sewer from the front building may be extended to the rear
                  building and the whole considered as one building sewer.
                  Old building sewers may be used in connection with new buildings only when they are found, on examination and test by
                  the superintendent, to meet all requirements of the article.
                  The size, slope, alignment materials of construction of a building sewer, and the methods to be used in excavating,
                  placing of the pipe, jointing, testing, and backfilling the trench, shall all conform to the requirements of the building and
                  plumbing code or other applicable rules and regulations of the city. In the absence of code provisions or in amplification
                  thereof, the materials and procedures set forth in appropriate specifications of the ASTM and WPCF Manual of Practice
                  Number 9 shall apply.
                  Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the building at an elevation below the basement floor. In all
                  buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such
                  building drain shall be lifted by an approved means and discharged to the building.
                  No person shall make connection of roof downspouts, exterior foundation drains, areaway drains, or other sources of
                  surface runoff or groundwater to a building sewer or building drain which in turn is connected directly or indirectly to a
                  public sanitary sewer.
                  The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall conform to the requirements of the building or plumbing
                  code or other applicable rules and regulations of the city, or the procedures set forth in appropriate specifications of the
                  ASTM and the WPCF Manual of Practice No 9. All such connections shall be made gastight and watertight. Any deviation
                  from the prescribed procedures and materials must by approved by the superintendent before installation.
                  The applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify the superintendent when the building sewer is ready for
                  inspection and connection to the public sewer. The connection shall be made under the supervision of the
                  superintendent or his representative.
                  All excavations for building sewer installation shall be adequately guarded with barricades and lights so as to protect the
                  public from hazard. Streets, sidewalks, and parkways and other public property disturbed in the course of the work shall
                  be restored in a manner satisfactory to the city.

                  Sec. 36-109. - Discharge restrictions.
                  No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any stormwater, surface water, groundwater, roof runoff,
                  subsurface drainage, uncontaminated cooling water, or unpolluted industrial process waters to any sanitary sewer.
                  Stormwater and all other unpolluted drainage shall be discharged to such sewers as are specifically designated as
                  combined sewers or storm sewers, or to a natural outlet approved by the superintendent. Industrial cooling waters or
                  unpolluted waters may be discharged on approval of the superintendent to the storm sewer, combined sewer or natural
                  outlet.
                  No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any of the following described waters to any public sewers:
                  Any gasoline, benzene, naphtha, fuel oil, or other flammable or explosive liquid, solid or gas.
                  Any waters or wastes containing toxic or poisonous solids, liquids, or gases in sufficient quantity, either singly or by
                  interaction with other wastes, to injure or interfere with any sewage treatment process, constitute a hazard to
                  animals or humans, create a public nuisance, or create any hazard in the receiving waters of the sewage treatment
                  plant, including, but not limited to cyanides in excess of two mg/l as CN in the wastes as discharged to the public
                  sewer.
                  Any waters or wastes having a pH lower than 5.5, or having any corrosive property capable of causing damage or

                  hazard to structures, equipment, and personnel of the sewage works.
                  Solid or viscous substances in quantities or of such size capable of causing obstruction to the flow in sewers, or
                  other interference with the proper operation of the sewage works, such as, but not limited to, ashes, cinders, sand,
                  mud, straw, shavings, metal, glass, rags, feathers, tar, plastics, wood, unground garbage, whole blood, paunch
                  manure, hair and fleshings, entrails and paper dishes, cups, milk containers, etc., either whole or ground by garbage
                  grinders.
                  No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged the following described substances, materials, waters, or wastes if it
                  appears likely in the opinion of the superintendent that such wastes can harm either the sewers, sewage treatment
                  process, or equipment, have an adverse effect on the receiving stream, or can otherwise endanger life, limb, public
                  property, or constitute a nuisance. In forming his opinion as to the acceptability of these wastes, the superintendent will
                  give consideration to such factors as the quantities of subject wastes in relation to flows and velocities in the sewers,
                  materials of construction of the sewers, nature of the sewage treatment process, capacity of the sewage treatment plant,
                  degree of treatability of wastes in the sewage treatment plant, and other pertinent factors. The substances prohibited
                  are:
                  Any liquid or vapor having a temperature higher than 150 degrees Fahrenheit (65 degrees Celsius).
                  Any waters or wastes containing fats, wax, grease, or oils, whether emulsified or not, in excess of 100 mg/l or
                  containing substances which may solidify or become viscous at temperatures between 32 degrees and 150 degrees
                  Fahrenheit (0 and 65 degrees Celsius).
                  Any garbage that has not been properly shredded. The installation and operation of any garbage grinder equipped
                  with a motor of three-fourths horsepower (0.76 hp metric) or greater shall be subject to the review and approval of
                  the superintendent.
                  Any waters or wastes containing strong acid iron pickling water, or concentrated plating solutions whether
                  neutralized or not.
                  Any waters or wastes containing iron, chromium, copper, zinc, and similar objectionable or toxic substances; or
                  wastes exerting an excessive chlorine requirement, to such degree that any such material received in the composite
                  sewage at the sewage treatment works exceeds the limits established by the superintendent for such materials.
                  Any waters or wastes containing phenols or other taste or odor producing substances, in such concentrations
                  exceeding limits which may be established by the superintendent as necessary, after treatment of the composite
                  sewage, to meet the requirements of the state, federal, or other public agencies of jurisdiction for such discharge to
                  the receiving waters.
                  Any radioactive water or isotopes of such half-life or concentration as may exceed limits established by the
                  superintendent in compliance with applicable state or federal regulations.
                  Any waters or wastes having a pH in excess of 9.5.
                  Materials which exert or cause:
                  Unusual concentrations of inert suspended solids (such as, but not limited to, Fullers earth, lime slurries, and
                  lime residues) or of dissolved solids (such as, but not limited to, sodium chloride and sodium sulfate).
                  Excessive discoloration (such as, but not limited to, dye water and vegetable tanning solutions).
                  Unusual BOD, chemical oxygen demand, or chlorine requirements in such quantities as to constitute a
                  significant load on the sewage treatment works.
                  Unusual volume of flow or concentration of wastes constituting slugs as defined herein.
                  Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to treatment or reduction by the sewage
                  treatment processes employed, or are amenable to treatment only to such degree that the sewage treatment plant
                  effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having jurisdiction over discharge to the receiving waters.
                  If any waters or wastes are discharged, or are proposed to be discharged to the public sewers, which waters contain the
                  substances or possess the characteristics enumerated in subsection (d) of this section, and which in the judgment of the
                  superintendent, may have a deleterious effect upon the sewage works, processes, equipment, or receiving water, or

                  which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the superintendent may:
                  Reject the wastes;
                  Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition or discharge to the public;
                  Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/or
                  Require payment to cover the added costs of handling and treating the wastes not covered by existing taxes or
                  sewer charges under the provisions of subsection (j) of this section.
                  If the superintendent permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste flows, the design and installation of the plants and
                  equipment shall be subject to the review and approval of the superintendent, and subject to the requirements of all
                  applicable codes, ordinances, and laws.
                  Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of the superintendent, they are necessary for
                  the proper handling of liquid wastes containing grease in excessive amounts, or any flammable wastes, sand, or other
                  harmful ingredients; except that such interceptors shall not be required for private living quarters or dwelling units. All
                  interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by the superintendent, and shall be located as to be readily and
                  easily accessible for cleaning and inspection.
                  Where preliminary treatment or flow equalizing facilities are provided for any waters or wastes, they shall be maintained
                  continuously in satisfactory and effective operation by the owner at his expense.
                  When required by the superintendent, the owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes
                  shall install a suitable control manhole together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the building
                  sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, accessibly and safely located, and shall be constructed in accordance with plans
                  approved by the superintendent, the manhole shall be installed by the owner at his expense, and shall be maintained by
                  him so as to be safe and accessible at all times.
                  All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes to which reference is made in this
                  article shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and
                  Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association, and shall be determined at the control manhole
                  provided, or upon suitable samples taken at said control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
                  manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by
                  customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
                  existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. The particular analyses involved will determine whether a 24-hour
                  composite of all outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample should be taken. Normally, but not
                  always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are obtained from 24-hour composites of all outfalls whereas pH's are
                  determined from periodic grab samples.
                  No statement contained in this article shall be construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement between
                  the city and any industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by the
                  city for treatment, subject to payment therefor, by the industrial concern.
                  All industrial users of the system shall comply with all parts of this article relevant to them and shall comply with the
                  requirements, regulations and standards contained in the Environmental Protection Agency Code of Federal Regulations,
                  title 40, part 128, concerning industrial pretreatment.

                  Sec. 38-100. - Agricultural District, A-1.
                  It is the intent of the A-1 Agricultural District to provide for the continued existence of agricultural uses, and lower-density
                  residential development than is found in the R-1 Residential District. The A-1 Agricultural District comprises that portion of the city which
                  is primarily rural in nature, but which can be expected to experience urban development in the future. The following uses are permitted
                  in the A-1 Agricultural District:
                  Any type of agriculture use.
                  Any use permitted in the R-1 Residential District.
                  Mobile homes and mobile home parks.
                  Hospitals.
                  Cemeteries.
                  Golf courses.
                  Facilities providing municipal services.

                  Sec. 38-101. - Single-Family Residential District, R-1.
                  The R-1 Single-Family Residential District is composed chiefly of existing low-density residential areas of the city, and vacant or open
                  areas where similar residential development appears likely to occur. This is the most restrictive residential district. The principal use of
                  land is for single-family dwellings and related recreational, religious and educational facilities normally required to provide an orderly
                  and attractive residential area. These residential areas are intended to be defined and protected from the encroachment of uses which
                  are not appropriate to residential environment. Stability of property values, attractiveness, order and efficiency are encouraged by
                  providing for adequate light, air, and open space for dwellings and related facilities and through consideration of the proper functional
                  relationship of the different uses. The following uses are permitted in the R-1 Single-Family Residential District:
                  Single-family dwellings, except trailers and mobile homes.
                  Agriculture, excluding the commercial raising of poultry and livestock.
                  Church bulletin boards not exceeding 20 square feet in area.
                  Churches, fraternal organizations and clubs not operating for a profit; provided that:
                  There is a planted buffer strip at least ten feet wide along the side and rear lines; and
                  The buildings are located not less than 50 feet from any lot line.
                  Customary accessory uses or buildings.

                  There is no external evidence of such occupations, except an announcement sign not more than two square
                  feet in area; and
                  That the operations are conducted within a dwelling by not more than one person in addition to those persons

                  No vehicles or equipment are stored on the premises; and
                  The lot includes a planted buffer strip at least ten feet wide along the side and rear property lines.
                  Public buildings, structures and grounds, except cemeteries.
                  Schools, including private schools, nursery schools, and kindergartens. The off-street parking provisions of section
                  38-163, are applicable to these uses.
                  Signs not more than six square feet in area advertising the sale or rental of the property on which they are located.

                  Sec. 38-102. - Multifamily Residential District, R-2.
                  It is the intent of the R-2 Multifamily Residential District to provide for a less restricted type of residential development at higher
                  densities but under similar environmental conditions as found in the R-1 Single-Family Residential District. The principal use of land may
                  range from single-family to multiple-family and garden apartment uses. Certain uses which are more compatible functionally with
                  intensive residential uses than with commercial uses are permitted. The recreational, religious, and educational facilities normally
                  required to provide an orderly and attractive residential area are permitted. Stability of property values, attractiveness, order and
                  efficiency are encouraged by providing for adequate light, air and open space for dwellings and related facilities and thorough
                  consideration of the proper functional relationship of each use permitted in the district. The following uses are permitted in the R-2
                  Multifamily Residential District:
                  Any use permitted in the R-1 Single-Family Residential District.
                  Multifamily residence.
                  Boardinghouses and roominghouses.
                  Hospitals.
                  House trailers (mobile homes) shall be permitted provided that:
                  A single house trailer shall be allowed on a single lot in the R-2 Multifamily Residential District provided said
                  lot, whether existing or created, has the minimum square feet as herein specified for a lot in this district and
                  provided that adequate sanitary sewage facilities are installed or connected to as recommended by the state
                  health department.
                  House trailers shall be allowed in the R-2 Multifamily Residential District on property that has been designed
                  and developed as a trailer park, which has been constructed according to the following:
                  All mobile home parks shall be located on a well-drained site, properly graded to ensure rapid drainage
                  and freedom from stagnant pools of water.
                  Each mobile home shall have a minimum space area of 3,000 square feet, exclusive or roadways, parking
                  areas and common use areas.

                  from which this chapter is derived:
                  Did not at that time own sufficient contiguous land to enable him to conform to the minimum lot size requirements
                  of this article; or
                  If the topography, physical shape, or other unique feature of such lots of record prevents reasonable compliance
                  with the setback or other requirements of this article;
                  such plot of land may nevertheless be used as a building site. The yard and other space requirements of the district in

                  as a building site; however, in no case shall the building inspector permit any lot in a residential district to be used as a
                  building site which is less than 4,000 square feet in total area, 25 feet in width, or has front, side and rear yard setbacks of
                  less than 15 feet (front), three feet (side), and five feet (rear), respectively.

                  located wholly or in part within 100 feet on each side of such lot within the same block and zoning district and fronting on the same side
                  of the street is less than the required minimum setback. In such cases, the setback on such lots may be less than the required setback
                  but not less than the average of the setbacks of the aforementioned existing buildings.
