PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Sylvester, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1965 Code, as supplemented through October 17, 1977, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the mayor and city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1965 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Brad Christy, Code Attorney, and Connie Timmons, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project.

Coleman, III, City Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

(hereinafter referred to as the "Act") and its implementing regulations govern the procurement, management, and administration of certain engineering, architectural, and design related projects which are funded by the Federal-Aid Highway Program (herein referred to as "FAHP.") The Act establishes a qualifications-based selection process, in which contracts are negotiated on the basis of demonstrated competence and qualification for the type of professional services required at a fair and reasonable price. The purpose of this section is to ensure compliance with the Act and its implementing regulations. 
(b)  Definitions. Any term used in this section shall have the meaning prescribed by the Brooks Act, 23 U.S.C.A. § 101 et. seq. and its implementing regulations. See 23 U.S.C.A. § 101, 23 U.S.C.A. § 112(b)(2), 40 U.S.C.A. § 1103 et. seq., 23 C.F.R. § 172.3, and 48 C.F.R. § 31.001. 
(c)  Applicability and governing law. Notwithstanding any other provision contained within this article, except as provided in sections (h) and (i) below, the city shall utilize the procurement methods set forth in sections (d), (e), (f), and (g) below for the procurement of engineering and design related services when FAHP funds are involved in the contract, as further specified in 23 U.S.C.A. § 112(b)(2)(A). 
To the extent that any provision contained within this section is in conflict with or inconsistent with the Act and its implementing regulations, or any other applicable federal law or regulation, then the procedures set forth in this section shall yield to the provisions set forth within the applicable federal law or regulation. 
(d)  Competitive solicitation. The solicitation process shall be by public announcement, public advertisement, or any other public forum or method that assures qualified in-state and out-of-state consultants are given a fair opportunity to be considered for award of the contract. Procurement procedures may involve a single step process with issuance of a request for proposal (RFP) to all interested consultants or a multiphase process with issuance of a request for statements or letters of interest or qualifications (RFQ) whereby responding consultants are ranked based on qualifications and request for proposals are then provided to three or more of the most highly qualified consultants. Minimum qualifications of consultants to perform services under general work categories or areas of expertise may also be assessed through a prequalification process whereby statements of qualifications are submitted on an annual basis. Regardless of any process utilized for prequalification of consultants or for an initial assessment of a consultant's qualifications under an RFQ, a RFP specific to the project, task, or service is required for evaluation of a consultant's specific technical approach and qualifications. 
(e)  Competitive evaluation criteria. 
(1)  Criteria used for evaluation, ranking, and selection of consultants to perform engineering and design related services must assess the demonstrated competence and qualifications for the type of professional services solicited. These qualifications-based factors may include, but are not limited to, technical approach (e.g., project understanding, innovative concepts or alternatives, quality control procedures), work experience, specialized expertise, professional licensure, staff capabilities, workload capacity, and past performance. 
(2)  Price shall not be used as a factor in the evaluation, ranking, and selection phase. All price or cost related items which include, but are not limited to, cost proposals, direct salaries/wage rates, indirect cost rates, and other direct costs are prohibited from being used as evaluation criteria. 
(3)  In-state or local preference shall not be used as a factor in the evaluation, ranking, and selection phase. State licensing laws are not preempted by this provision and professional licensure within a jurisdiction may be established as a requirement which attests to the minimum qualifications and competence of a consultant to perform the solicited services. 
(4)  The following non-qualifications based evaluation criteria are permitted under the specified conditions and provided the combined total of these criteria do not exceed a nominal value of ten percent of the total evaluation criteria to maintain the integrity of a qualifications-based selection: 
a.  A local presence may be used as a nominal evaluation factor where appropriate. This criterion shall not be based on political or jurisdictional boundaries and may be applied on a project-by-project basis for contracts where a need has been established for a consultant to provide a local presence, a local presence will add value to the quality and efficiency of the project, and application of this criteria leaves an appropriate number of qualified consultants, given the nature and size of the project. If a consultant outside of the locality area indicates as part of a proposal that it will satisfy the criteria in some manner, such as establishing a local project office, that commitment shall be considered to have satisfied the local presence criteria. 
b.  The participation of qualified and certified disadvantaged business enterprise (DBE) sub-consultants may be used as a nominal evaluation criterion where appropriate in accordance with 49 C.F.R. Part 26. 
(f)  Competitive evaluation, ranking, and selection. 
(1)  Evaluation criteria. Consultant proposals shall be evaluated by the city based on the criteria established and published within the public solicitation and based on the methods and procedures set forth herein. 
(2)  Sub-consultants. While the contract will be with the prime consultant, proposal evaluations shall consider the qualifications of the prime consultant and any sub-consultants identified within the proposal. 
(3)  Evaluation and discussions. Following submission and evaluation of proposals, the city shall conduct interviews or other types of discussions determined three of the most highly qualified consultants to clarify the technical approach, qualifications, and capabilities provided in response to the RFP and to discuss anticipated concepts and compare alternative methods for furnishing services. Discussion requirements shall be specified within the RFP and should be based on the size and complexity of the project. Discussions may be written, by telephone, video conference, or by oral presentation or interview. Discussions following proposal submission are not required provided proposals contain sufficient information for evaluation of technical approach and qualifications to perform the specific project, task, or service with respect to established criteria. 
(4)  Ranking. From the proposal evaluation and any subsequent discussions which have been conducted, the city shall rank, in order of preference, at least three consultants determined most highly qualified to perform the solicited services based on the established and published criteria. 
(5)  Notification. Notification must be provided to responding consultants of the final ranking of the three most highly qualified consultants. 
(g)  Negotiation. 
(1)  In general. The city shall negotiate a contract at compensation which the city determines is fair and reasonable. In determining fair and reasonable compensation, the city shall consider the scope, complexity, professional nature, and estimated value of the services to be rendered. 
(2)  Order of negotiation. The city shall attempt to negotiate a contract with the most highly qualified firm selected under section (f)(4) above. If the city is unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract with the firm, the city shall formally terminate negotiations and then undertake negotiations with the next most qualified of the selected firms, continuing the process until an agreement is reached. If the city is unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract with any of the selected firms, the city shall select additional firms in order of their competence and qualification and continue negotiations in accordance with this section until an agreement is reached. 
(3)  Independent estimate. Prior to receipt or review of the most highly qualified consultant's cost proposal, the city shall prepare a detailed independent estimate with an appropriate breakdown of the work or labor hours, types or classifications of labor required, other direct costs, and consultant's fixed fee for the defined scope of work. The independent estimate shall serve as the basis for negotiation and ensuring the consultant services are obtained at a fair and reasonable cost. 
(4)  Cost plus. Pursuant to 23 C.F.R. 172.5, the cost plus a percentage of cost and percentage of construction cost methods of compensation shall not be used. 
(5)  Handling of cost proposals. If concealed cost proposals were submitted in conjunction with technical/qualifications proposals, only the cost proposal of the consultant with which negotiations are initiated may be considered. Concealed cost proposals of consultants with which negotiations are not initiated should be returned to the respective consultant due to the confidential nature of this data, as required by 23 U.S.C. 112(b)(2)(E). 
(6)  FHWA approval. Pursuant to 23 C.F.R. § 172.9, Contracts and contract settlements involving design services for projects that have not been delegated to the State under 23 U.S.C. § 106(c), that do not fall under the small purchase procedures, shall be subject to the prior approval by FHWA, unless an alternate approval procedure has been approved by FHWA. Further, any contract, revision of a contract or settlement of a contract for design services for a project that is expected to fall under 23 U.S.C. § 106(h) shall be submitted to the FHWA for approval. 
(7)  To the extent required by 23 U.S.C. 112(b)(2), contracts shall be performed and audited in accordance with the federal acquisition regulations. Indirect cost rates and application thereof shall be governed by applicable federal law, including 23 U.S.C. 112(b)(2)(C) and (D). 
(h)  Small purchase exception. The small purchase method involves procurement of engineering and design related services where an adequate number of qualified sources are reviewed and the total contract costs do not exceed an established simplified acquisition threshold. The city may use the state's small purchase procedures which reflect applicable state laws and regulations for the procurement of engineering and design related services provided the total contract costs do not exceed the federal simplified acquisition threshold (as specified in 48 C.F.R. 2.101). When a lower threshold for use of small purchase procedures is established in state law, regulation, or policy, the lower threshold shall apply to the use of FAHP funds. 
The following additional requirements shall apply to the small purchase procurement method: 
(1)  The scope of work, project phases, and contract requirements shall not be broken down into smaller components merely to permit the use of small purchase procedures. 
(2)  A minimum of three consultants are required to satisfy the adequate number of qualified sources reviewed. 
(3)  Contract costs may be negotiated in accordance with state small purchase procedures; however, the allow ability of costs shall be determined in accordance with the federal cost principles. 
(4)  The full amount of any contract modification or amendment that would cause the total contract amount to exceed the established simplified acquisition threshold is ineligible for federal-aid funding. 
(i)  Non-competitive exception. The noncompetitive method involves procurement of engineering and design related services when it is not feasible to award the contract using competitive negotiation or small purchase procurement methods. The following requirements shall apply to the noncompetitive procurement method: 
(1)  The city may use their own noncompetitive procedures which reflect applicable state and local laws and regulations and conform to applicable federal requirements. 
(2)  The city shall establish a process to determine when noncompetitive procedures will be used and shall submit justification to, and receive approval from, the FHWA before using this form of contracting. 
(3)  Circumstances under which a contract may be awarded by noncompetitive procedures are limited to the following: 
a.  The service is available only from a single source; 
b.  There is an emergency which will not permit the time necessary to conduct competitive negotiations; or

The owner and parties in interest shall have the right to file an answer to the complaint and to appear in person or by attorney and offer testimony at the time and place fixed for the hearing. 
(e)  Court order. After such notice and hearing, if the court determines that the dwelling, building, or structure in question is unfit for human habitation or is unfit for its current commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes, is vacant or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the court shall state in writing findings of fact in support of such determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner and any parties in interest that have answered the complaint or appeared at the hearing an order to abate the nuisance.

The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful." 
(g)  Sale of salvaged materials when structure is demolished.

The complaint shall identify the subject real property by appropriate street address and official tax map reference, identify the owner and parties in interest, state with particularity the factual basis for the action, and contain a statement of the action sought by the public officer to abate the alleged nuisance. The summons shall notify the owner and parties in interest that a hearing will be held before the municipal court at a date and time certain and at a place within the city. Such hearing shall be held not less than 15 days and not more than 45 days after the filing of the complaint in court. The owner and parties in interest shall have the right to file an answer to the complaint and to appear in person or by attorney and offer testimony at the time and place fixed for hearing. 
(d)  Court order. If after such notice and hearing the court determines that the dwelling, building, or structure in question is unfit for human habitation or is unfit for its current commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes, is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes, or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the court shall state in writing findings of fact in support of such determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner and any parties in interest that have answered the complaint or appeared at the hearing an order: 
(1)  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the dwelling, building, or structure can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter, or improve such dwelling, building, or structure so as to bring it into full compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violation and, if applicable, to secure the structure so that it cannot be used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or 
(2)  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the dwelling, building, or structure in order to bring it into full compliance with applicable codes relevant to the cited violations cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to demolish and remove the dwelling, building, or structure and remove all debris from the property. 
For purposes of this section, the court shall make its determination of reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building or structure without consideration of the value of the land on which the structure is situated; provided, however, that costs of the preparation necessary to repair, alter, or improve a structure may be considered. The income and financial status of the owner shall not be a factor in the court's determination. The present value of the structure and the costs of repair, alteration, or improvement may be established by affidavits of real estate appraisers with a Georgia appraiser classification as provided in O.C.G.A. tit. 41, ch. 39A (O.C.G.A. § 43-39A-1 et seq.), qualified building contractors, or qualified building inspectors without actual testimony presented. Costs of repair, alteration, or improvement of the structure shall be the cost necessary to bring the structure into compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violations in force in the jurisdiction. 
(e)  Effect of failure to comply with order; posting of placard. If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair or demolish the dwelling, building, or structure, the public officer may cause such dwelling, building, or structure, to be repaired, altered, improved, to be vacated and closed, and/or to be demolished, as provided in the order. The public officer shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of the building, dwelling, or structure a placard with the following words: "This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business use and does not comply with the applicable codes or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with drug crimes or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful." 
(f)  Sale of salvaged materials when structure is demolished. If the public officer has the structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any moneys received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. The public officer and the city are relieved of any and all liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials. 
(g)  Lien for cost of demolition. The amount of the cost of demolition, including all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the tax commissioner, and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, including restoration to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred. 
(1)  The lien provided for in this subsection shall attach to the real property upon the filing of a certified copy of the order requiring repair, closure, or demolition in the office of the clerk of the superior court of the county and shall relate back to the date of the filing of the lis pendens notice required under section 46-125. The clerk of the superior court, as required by O.C.G.A. § 41-2-9(b)(1), shall record and index such certified copy of the order in the deed records of the county and enter the lien on the general execution docket. The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except liens for taxes, to which the lien shall be inferior, and shall continue in force until paid. After filing a certified copy of the order with the clerk of the superior court, the public officer shall forward a copy of the order and a final statement of costs to the county tax commissioner. As required by O.C.G.A. § 41-2-9(b)(1) and (2), it shall be the duty of the county tax commissioner to collect the amount of the lien in conjunction with the collection of ad valorem taxes on the property and to collect the amount of the lien as if it were a real property ad valorem tax, using all methods available for collecting real property ad valorem taxes, including specifically O.C.G.A. tit. 48, ch. 4 (O.C.G.A. § 48-4-1 et seq.); provided, however, that the limitation of O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 which requires 12 months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure shall not apply. The tax commissioner shall remit the amount collected to the city clerk. Thirty days after imposition of the lien, the unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes. 
(2)  The tax commissioner shall collect and retain an amount equal to the cost of administering a lien authorized by O.C.G.A. § 41-2-7 et seq., unless such costs are waived by resolution of the county. Any such amount collected and retained for administration shall be deposited in the general fund of the county to pay the cost of administering the lien. 
(3)  The city may waive and release any such lien imposed on property upon the owner of such property entering into a contract with the county or municipality agreeing to a timetable for rehabilitation of the real property of the dwelling, building, or structure on the property and demonstrating the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation. 
(4)  Where the abatement action does not commence in the superior court, review of a court order requiring the repair, alteration, improvement, or demolition of a dwelling, building, or structure shall be by direct appeal to the superior court under O.C.G.A. § 5-3-29. 
(5)  The public officers designated in this division may issue citations for violations of state minimum standard codes, optional building, fire, life safety, and other codes adopted by ordinance, and conditions creating a public health hazard or general nuisance, and may seek to enforce such citation in a court of competent jurisdiction prior to issuing a complaint in rem as provided in this division. 
(6)  Nothing in this division shall be construed to impair or limit in any way the power of the city to define and declare nuisances and to cause their removal or abatement by summary proceedings or otherwise.

Sec. 46-194. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices. 
(a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the ordinance and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this ordinance shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections (b) and (c). The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this ordinance and the NPDES general permit. 
(b)  Minimum Requirements/BMPs. 
(1)  Best management practices as set forth in subsections (b) and (c) shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection, the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
(2)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
(3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs. 
(4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land-disturbing activities occur. 
(5)  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsection (c)(15) and (16), in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
(c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
(1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
(2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
(3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
(4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
(5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive element shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
(6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
(7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
(8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
(9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
(10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
(11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
(12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
(13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
(14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for the treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection (b)(2); 
(15)  Except as provided in paragraph (16) of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implements; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term 'ephemeral stream' means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow, unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". Shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
(16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirement shall apply to such buffer: 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as longs as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines. 
(d)  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections (b) and (c). 
(e)  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this ordinance or the terms of the permit. 
(Ord. No. 2010-17, § 1(Exh. A, Art. IV), 12-20-2010) 
Sec. 46-195. - Application/permit process. 
(a)  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this ordinance, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
(b)  Application requirements. 
(1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the City of Sylvester without first obtaining a permit from the code enforcement department to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
(2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the code enforcement department, and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection (c). Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land-disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of subsection 46-194(b) and (c) will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by three copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
(3)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) half of the such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
(4)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by subsections (c)(15) and (16) has been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per subsection 46-194(b)(6), have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
(5)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this ordinance section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
(6)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-distributing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
(c)  Plan requirements. 
(1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in subsection 46-194(b) and (c), or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this article. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and stormwater management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land-disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
(2)  Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
(d)  Permits. 
(1)  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
(2)  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this ordinance, any variances required by subsection 46-194(c)(15) and (16), are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per subsection (b)(6) are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
(3)  Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this article, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
(4)  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
(5)  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this article. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
(6)  The LIA may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(f)(1).

Sec. 46-196. - Inspection and enforcement. 
(a)  The soil and erosion inspector will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittee as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article. 
(b)  The local issuing authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within 12 months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975. 
(c)  The Soil and Erosion Level 1B Inspector shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this article, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities. 
(d)  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
(e)  The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(1). The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
(f)  The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to [O.C.G.A.] § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within 90 days after notification by the division, the division shall revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority.

ARTICLE IV. - TREE PROTECTION 

Sec. 48-71. - Tree protection. 
All construction or infrastructure improvement projects conducted on city property need to include a plan to protect trees from damage within or adjacent to the construction zone. This includes not only the trunk and branches but also the critical root zone (CRZ). These steps shall be followed: 
•  Identify the boundaries of the area where clearing or excavation will take place, as well as where equipment will be operated or where fill materials will be stored. 
•  Identify existing trees within that boundary, 
•  Calculate the area of their critical root zones (CRZ) for each tree. The radius of the CRZ equals one foot for every inch of tree diameter measured at four and one-half feet above ground level (breast height). Where trees are growing in a clump, use the CRZs of the trees at the outside of the clump. 
•  Remove unhealthy or undesirable trees that are likely to fail if their root systems are impacted by construction activities. 
•  Protect desirable trees by erecting barriers around the perimeter of the CRZ. Do not allow equipment operation, parking, storage of fill, or mixing chemicals within the CRZ. 
•  Use tunneling or excavation with an air spade to install or maintain water or utility lines within the CRZ, rather than cutting a trench through the roots. 
•  Consider using gravel or alternative paving materials to avoid cutting large roots when sidewalk repairs are done adjacent to large desirable trees.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 54-31. - Authorization. 
Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and Section 36-1-20(a) of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the Mayor and City Council, of Sylvester, Georgia, does ordain as follows. 
(Ord. No. 2009-08, Art. 1, § A, 7-20-2009) 
Sec. 54-32. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of Sylvester, Georgia are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
(Ord. No. 2009-08, Art. 1, § B, 7-20-2009) 
Sec. 54-33. - Statement of purpose. 
It is the purpose of this article to promote public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
(3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion, and; 
(4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; 
(5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters. 
(Ord. No. 2009-08, Art. 1, § C, 7-20-2009) 
Sec. 54-34. - Objectives. 
The objectives of this chapter are: 
(1)  To protect human life and health; 
(2)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(3)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas, 
(4)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(5)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(6)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions, and; 
(7)  To insure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
(Ord. No. 2009-08, Art. 1, § D, 7-20-2009) 
Sec. 54-35. - Lands to which this ordinance applies.

The degree of flood protection required by this article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur; flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes.

Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (NOTE: accessory structures are NOT exempt from any ordinance requirements.) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the "start of construction" of the improvement. NOTE: The market value of the structure should be: (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement; or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include: (1) those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project; or (2) any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure". 
Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this article, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article. 
Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

(Ord. No. 2009-08, Art. 4, § A, 7-20-2009) 
Sec. 54-62. - Specific standards. 
In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
(1)  New construction and/or substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and/or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 54-61(4), "Elevated buildings". 
a.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one foot above the base flood elevation. 
(2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-30, AE or AH zones, may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in subsection 54-53(6). 
(3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
a.  All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on: (1) individual lots or parcels, (2) in new and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, (3) in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or (4) on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
b.  Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
(i)  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation, or 
(ii)  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (Ref. subsection 54-61(6).) 
d.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
(i)  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days. 
(ii)  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions), or 
(iii)  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "new construction", including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsections 54-62(3)a. and c., above. 
(4)  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 54-36, are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. 
Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
b.  Only if subsection 54-62(4)a. above is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of division 3. 
(Ord. No. 2009-08, Art. 4, § B, 7-20-2009) 
Sec. 54-63. - Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodway (A-zones). 
Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 54-36, where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A-zones), or where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions apply: 
(1)  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 54-36, then the city manager or his/her designee shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of division 3. Only if data are not available from these sources, then the following provisions (subsections (2) and (3)) shall apply: 
(2)  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 20 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in more than a one foot increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(3)  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. (Note: Require the lowest floor to be elevated one foot above the estimated base flood elevation in A-zone areas where a limited detail study has been completed). Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 54-61(4) "Elevated buildings". 
a.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site.

Sec. 54-64. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO zones). 
Areas of special flood hazard established in section 54-36, may include designated "AO" shallow flooding areas. These areas have base flood depths of one to three feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. The following provisions apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 54-61(4), "Elevated buildings". 
The city manager or his/her designee shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
(2)  New construction or the substantial improvement of a nonresidential structure may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to the specified FIRM flood level plus one foot, above highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and as required in subsections 54-52(1)c. and (2). 
(3)  Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure. 
(Ord. No. 2009-08, Art. 4, § D, 7-20-2009)

(a)  The Sylvester Planning Commission shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this article. 
(b)  The Sylvester Planning Commission shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the city manager or his/her designee in the enforcement or administration of this article. 
(c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Sylvester Planning Commission may appeal such decision to the Superior Court of Worth County, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1. 
(d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this section are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
(f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(g)  In reviewing such requests, the Sylvester Planning Commission shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article. 
(h)  Conditions for variances: 
(1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
(i)  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
(ii)  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
(iii)  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(2)  The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
(3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(4)  The city manager or his/her designee shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
(i)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the Sylvester Planning Commission may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

1.  Be owned (or leased) and operated by an existing customer for production of electric energy, and 
2.  Be connected to and/or operate in parallel with the city's distribution facilities, and 
3.  Be intended primarily to offset part or all of the customer's generator's requirement for electricity, and 
4.  Have peak generating capacity of not more than ten kW for residential applications and not more than 125 percent of actual or expected maximum annual peak demand of the premise for commercial applications. 
5.  Be installed on the customer side of the meter 
(b)  Monthly metering charge. 
Bi-Directional ..... $2.50 per month 
or 
Single Directional 
Single-Phase ..... $4.50 per month 
or 
Poly-phase ..... $11.00 per month 
The city electric department will install single directional metering or bi-directional metering depending on the customer's method of installation. All installed costs for metering and associated equipment will be paid by the customer at the time service is initiated under this policy. 
Bi-directional metering is defined as measuring the amount of electricity supplied by the city and the amount fed back to the city by the customer's distributed generation facility during the billing period using the same meter. Bi-directional metering shall be used where distributed generation facilities are connected to the city on the customer's side of the customer's meter. 
Single directional metering shall be defined as measuring electricity produced or consumed during the billing period, in accordance with normal metering practices. Single directional metering shall be used where distributed generation facilities are connected to the city's distribution system on the city's side of the customer's meter. 
(c)  Monthly capacity cost. The city requires each customer with a distributed generation facility to pay the monthly stand-by capacity charges based on the installed nameplate capacity rating (in kW) of the customer's system. 
Residential at ..... $11.45 per kW per month 
Commercial non-demand at ..... $15.13 per kW per month 
Commercial demand at ..... $20.32 per kW per month 
Industrial at ..... $24.58 per kW per month 
Seasonal agriculture at ..... $8.39 per kW per month 
(d)  Payment for energy. 
(1)  Bi-directional metering. 
a.  When electricity supplied by the city exceeds electricity generated by the customer's distributed generation, the electricity shall be billed by the city in accordance with the applicable tariff(s). 
b.  When electricity generated by the customer's distributed generation system exceeds electricity supplied by the city, the customer shall be billed for the customer charges as described in the standard rate for that billing period and credited for excess kWh generated during the billing period at the city's avoided energy cost. 
(2)  Single directional metering. 
a.  For kWh's generated by customer's distributed generation facility, customer shall be compensated at the city's avoided cost of energy (kWh) as determined by the city. The city will only compensate customer for avoided energy kWh's as determined by metered energy delivered to the city's distribution system. 
b.  The customer's net bill will be calculated using the city calculation for avoided energy cost (as described below) credited to the customer, netted against the billing period charges for the customer's regular service (according to the applicable tariff) based on actual metered energy. 
(3)  Avoided energy cost. Payments by the city to the customer for the billing period metered avoided energy kWh's will be computed by the city in its sole discretion based on the average monthly wholesale market price as determined by the Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia (MEAG Power), the city's wholesale energy provider. 
In the event customer develops a credit balance during a billing period, the amount will remain as a credit on the customer's account. Credit balances remaining at the end of the city's fiscal year will be cleared by the issuance of a check for the credit balance to customer. Any other clearance of account credit balances will be at the city's discretion. 
(e)  Safety, power quality, and interconnection requirements. The customer shall be responsible for ensuring a safe and reliable interconnection with the city and all costs incurred therein.

(1)  Application for interconnection of distributed generation facility; 
(2)  Interconnection Agreement; 
(3)  Electrical power exchange agreement. 
The provisions in all documents outlined above are incorporated into this tariff in their entirety. For the avoidance of doubt, customer shall be deemed to have agreed to such provisions by applying for service under this tariff. 
The city will only be required to purchase energy from eligible distributed generation facilities on a first-come, first-served basis until the cumulative generating capacity of all renewable energy sources from all customers equals the percentage of the city's annual peak demand in the previous year as set forth in O.C.G.A. § 46-3-56(a). Additional energy may be purchased by the city at its sole discretion at a cost agreed to by it and the customer provider. The city shall at no time be required to purchase energy from customers in excess of amounts required by the DG Act. 
The city reserves the right to separate the customer generator's equipment from city lines and facilities when, in the city's judgment, the continued parallel operation is unsafe or may cause damage to persons or property. Upon such separation, the city shall promptly notify the customer generator so that any unsafe condition can be corrected.

If a water main extension project provides water capacity to other property owners abutting said extension, such other property owners shall be required to pay the city their proportionate share, if any, of the costs of the extension borne by the original developer on a front footage basis before connection to said extension. The charges collected, will be refunded by the city to the original developer, but in no case will refunds exceed the amount paid by the original developer. Any refunds due to the original developer will be paid without interest, on or about February 1 and on or about October 1, as appropriate. 
(j)  Liability for refunds. All liability for payment of refunds by the city shall cease seven years from the date of payment by the developer for water main extension. The assignment by the developer of any money due under the provisions of this refund policy without the written consent of the city is prohibited. 
(k)  Connection charge. If a water main is extended, either inside or outside the corporate limits, the costs of which is paid in part or in full by the city or dedicated to the city, developers who wish to connect to the main shall be required to pay a connection charge in addition to the meter installation fee as referenced in the fee schedule. The connection charge shall be the developer's proportionate share on a footage basis, of the cost of the extension. If the water main installation is larger than eight inches, the developer shall be required to pay only its proportionate share of the cost of an eight-inch main. 
(l)  Ownership and maintenance. All water mains extended under the provisions of these regulations, whether inside or outside the corporate limits, shall become the sole property of the city upon connection with the city water system and shall thenceforth be maintained by the city. 
(m)  Best interest of the city. Anything in these regulations to the contrary notwithstanding, the city at its sole discretion, shall have the right to disapprove any application for water service when it determines that it is not in its best interest to do so based on monetary or manpower constraints or on other considerations such as the availability of water supply.

ARTICLE III. - ESTABLISHMENT OF ZONING DISTRICTS 

Section 3.01. - Districts. 
The City of Sylvester is hereby divided into ten classes of districts known as follows: 

 
Section 3.02. - Limited use (LU) provision. 
The City of Sylvester "limited use" provision exists for the purpose of allowing an applicant to request that a certain area be designated as a limited use. In some areas of the city, a particular land use activity out of a general zoning classification may have less community impact than some of the possibilities of uses in that specific classification. For this reason, an applicant may request in his rezoning petition to limit the use of a proposed property to a specified use only (i.e., C-1 LU), to wit: Community business district limited to a "beauty shop." The limited use must be among the uses permitted in the zone classification for which the limited use is taken. 
Section 3.03. - District boundaries. 
The boundaries of the above districts are shown on a map designated "Official Zoning Map, City of Sylvester, Georgia." Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of any of the aforesaid districts as shown on the zoning maps, the following rules shall apply: 
A.  Where zoning district boundaries are indicated as approximately following the centerlines of roads or highways, or railroad right-of-way lines extended, such centerlines or railroad right-of-way lines or such lines extended shall be construed to be such boundaries. 
B.  Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately following the city line, such city line shall be construed to be such boundaries. 
C.  Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately parallel to the centerlines of streets or highways, such district boundaries, unless otherwise specifically indicated, shall be construed as being parallel thereto and at a distance of 200 feet from the right-of-way line of such streets and highways, each above district boundary being shown at scale on the official zoning map of the City of Sylvester, Georgia. 
D.  Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately following the centerline of stream beds or river beds, such centerlines or such lines extended shall be construed to be such boundaries. 
Section 3.04. - District boundary lines dividing a lot of single ownership. 
Where a district boundary line, as appearing on the zoning map, divides a lot in single ownership at the time of the enactment of these regulations, the requirements for the district in which the greater portion of the lot lines shall be extended to the balance of the lot, provided that such extension will not include any part of such lot more than 35 feet beyond the district boundary line and, provided further, that this provision shall not apply to a through lot. In the case of a through lot, the restriction of the district applying to the adjoining lots which front on the same street as the proposed use of the lot shall apply; a through lot being a lot that runs from street to street. 
ARTICLE IV. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 
Except as hereinafter specifically provided, the following regulations shall apply: 

Section 4.01. - Conflicting regulations. 
Whenever any provision of this ordinance imposes more stringent requirements, regulations, restrictions or limitations than are imposed or required by the provisions of any other law or ordinance, the provisions of this ordinance shall govern. 
Section 4.02. - Scope. 
No building or structure, or part thereof, shall hereinafter be erected, constructed, reconstructed, or altered and maintained, and no new use or change shall be made or maintained of any building, structure or land, or part thereof, except in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance. 
Section 4.03. - Only one principal dwelling per lot. 
Except as herein provided, there shall be no more than one principal dwelling per lot or parcel, other than within a PUD. 
Section 4.04. - Substandard lots.

Such variance may be granted in such individual case of unnecessary hardship upon a finding by the mayor and council that: 
1.  There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape or topography; and 
2.  The application of the ordinance to this particular piece of property would create an unnecessary hardship; and 
3.  Such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of property involved; and 
4.  Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public interest or impair the purposes and intent of this ordinance; provided, however, that no variance may be granted for a use of land or building which use is prohibited by this ordinance.

[The intent of the FH flood hazard district is] to restrict or prohibit uses which may be dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or which may cause increased flood heights or velocities; to require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities which serve such uses, be provided with physical flood protection features at the time of initial construction; to protect individuals from buying lands which are unsuited for intended purposes because of flood hazards; and other public requirements to protect against floods. 
Section 15.02. - District boundaries. 
For the purpose of these regulations, the Flood Insurance Study for the City of Sylvester, as prepared by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Federal Insurance Administration, is hereby made a part of these regulations.

In its review of plans submitted, the planning commission shall be guided by the following standards, keeping in mind that the purpose of this district is to prevent encroachment into the floodway which will unduly increase flood heights and endanger life and property: 
A.  Any structure or the filling of land permitted shall be of a type not appreciably damaged by floodwaters.

E.  The granting of approval of any structure or use shall not constitute a representation, guarantee or warranty of any kind or nature by the City of Sylvester or by any officer or employee thereof of the practicality or safety of any structure or use proposed and shall create no liability upon of [or] cause action against such public body, officer or employee for any damage that may result pursuant thereto. 
Section 15.05. - Warning of disclaimer of liability.

Editor's note— Ord. No. 2007-07, § 1, adopted Mar. 19, 2007, deleted Art. XVIII in its entirety and supplied provisions for a new Art. XVIII to read as set out herein. Former Art. XVIII pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 2004-12, § 1, adopted July 19, 2004; and Ord. No. 2003-02, adopted Jan. 21, 2003.

Section 18.01. - Purpose and findings. 
The mayor and city council find that signs provide an important medium through which individuals may convey a variety of messages. However, left completely unregulated, signs can become a threat to public safety as a traffic hazard and detriment to property values and the city's overall public welfare as an aesthetic nuisance. In addition with the volume of traffic in the city, uniform regulation of signage providing directional, commercial and non-commercial information to the public is essential. 
By enacting this amendment, the mayor and council intend to: 
(a)  Balance the rights of individuals to convey their messages through signs and the right of the public to be protected against the unrestricted proliferation of signs; 
(b)  Further the objectives of the city's comprehensive plan; 
(c)  Promote signs which are compatible with their surroundings; 
(d)  Protect the public health, safety, and welfare; 
(e)  Reduce traffic and pedestrian hazards; 
(f)  Maintain the historic image of the city; 
(g)  Protect property values by minimizing the possible adverse effects and visual blight caused by signs; 
(h)  Promote economic development; and 
(i)  Ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign regulations.

ARTICLE XIX. - AREA, HEIGHT, AND SETBACK REQUIREMENTS 

Section 19.01. - Schedule of regulations. 
[The following area, height and setback regulations shall be applicable:] 

 
(A), (B), (C), etc., denotes references to the footnotes to the schedule of regulations, as follows: 
A.  Planned unit developments. The requirements of area, height, bulk, and placement regulations, as they are usually applicable to individual buildings in lots of record, would, in certain cases of large scale developments, have results affording less protection to the public health, safety and welfare than if a measure of flexibility were permitted. The permitting of these planned unit developments can, in certain cases, increase the desirability and convenience to the residents or occupants of the planned unit development without causing adverse effects in adjoining properties. Therefore, the zoning regulations, relative to area, height, bulk and placement, may be modified by the planning commission and city council in the case of a plan for a large scale development which, in the judgment of the planning commission and city council, provides adequate open space and improvements for circulation, recreation, education, light, air and service needs of the tract when fully developed, provided that in no case may the density of the proposed planned unit development exceed that of the zoning regulation requirements, and, provided further, that the minimum site for residential planned unit development is three acres. 
B.  Refer to section 7.01 (R-PUD). 
C.  Refer to section 13.01 (C-PUD).
