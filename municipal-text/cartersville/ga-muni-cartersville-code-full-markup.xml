         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE                   This Code constitutes a complete republication of the ordinances of the City of Cartersville, Georgia of a general and permanent nature. 
                  Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1976 Code, as supplemented through February, 1986, and ordinances adopted by the city council and the 1990 Code and ordinances adopted by the city council through Ord. No. 51-09, adopted December 17, 2009. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this volume, the reader can locate any section of the 1976 Code, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
                  The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state laws have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this volume. 
                  Numbering System 
                  The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the second section of Chapter 1 is 1-2. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 1-2 and 1-3 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 1-2.1, 1-2.2 and 1-2.3, respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 9 and 10, it will be designated as Chapter 9.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
                  Indices 
                  The indices have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within each index which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
                  Looseleaf Supplements 
                  A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
                  Successfully keeping this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
                  Acknowledgments 
                  The republication of this Code was under the direct supervision of Anne Wilson and Janet Cramer, Editors, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
                  The publisher is most grateful to Connie Keeling, City Clerk, for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this Code. It is hoped that her efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the City readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

                  (k)  To define, regulate and prohibit any act, practice, conduct or use of property which is detrimental or likely to be detrimental to the health, morals, safety, security, peace, convenience, or general welfare of inhabitants of the city.

All signatures must be personal, or by mark with witnesses, and if more than one (1) sheet is used, they shall be bound together when offered for filing, and each sheet shall be numbered consecutively beginning with number one (1), at the foot of each page. Each sheet shall bear on the bottom or back thereof the affidavit of the person circulating such sheet setting forth that the signatures are all genuine and those made by mark are placed there at the request and in the presence of such signer, and shall contain a general statement of the general grounds upon which the recall is sought, the truth of which shall be supported by the affidavit, upon information and belief of one (1) or more of the signers. Within fifteen (15) days after the filing of such petition, excluding Sundays, the registrars shall compare the names appearing on the petition with the said registration books to determine if the petition contains the requisite thirty (30) percent of such registered names. If it be found that the petition does not contain the requisite number of such names, it shall be returned within seven (7) days, Sundays excepted, to the person or persons from whom received with a written statement with the number of names lacking. Within five (5) days after its return, Sundays excepted, the required number of additional names may be secured, and the petition re-presented together with the same affidavit prescribed for the original petition as to the signatures.

If after comparing the petition with the added names, as above stipulated with the registration book it be found it still lacks the required number of registered names, it shall be returned to the person from whom received with a written statement of the fact, with the date of the return written thereon, and no election shall be held; and in this event, and in the event an election is had failing to result in the recall of the member or members of the governing authority in question, no like petition shall be received for the recall of any member of the governing authority within six (6) months from the date of the election in the one (1) case, and the last return of the petition by the registrars in the other, and in no case shall a petition be filed for the recall of any member of the governing authority who shall not have been in service upon his or their present term of office for six (6) months. If the majority of those voting in the recall election, vote for the recall of any member or members of the governing authority, he or they shall vacate office as soon as his or their successor or successors are elected and qualified. 
                  Upon the recall of any member or members of the governing authority a special election shall be held as provided in the Georgia Municipal Election Code to elect his or their successor or successors. In such election no new registration of voters shall be had, but only those registered for the recall election and otherwise qualified shall be qualified to vote in such election. Every person desiring to become a candidate in the election provided for in this section shall file a notice of candidacy and pay his qualification fee, if any, as provided by law.

                  L.  This amendment is adopted for the purpose of promoting and expanding for the public good and welfare industry and trade in the City of Cartersville and its vicinity and reducing unemployment to the greatest extent possible, and this amendment and any law enacted with reference to the authority shall be liberally construed for the accomplishment of these purposes. 
                  M.  This amendment shall be effective immediately upon proclamation of its ratification by the governor and the first members of the authority shall be appointed within thirty (30) days after such proclamation. 
                  N.  The general assembly may by law further define and prescribe the powers and duties of the authority and the exercise thereof, and may enlarge and restrict the same, and may likewise further regulate the management and conduct of the authority.

The governing authority of the City of Cartersville, or the person designated by the said governing authority, shall provide affidavit forms for this purpose.

                  Sec. 2-161. - Policy statement. 
                  The purpose of this program is to establish procedures for the administration of the Department of Transportation (DOT) anti-drug program pursuant to the Pipeline Safety Regulations, Code of Federal Regulations, Title 49 (49 CFR), Part 199. Part 199 requires operators of gas systems to have an anti-drug program for persons who perform on these facilities operating, maintenance, or emergency response functions covered by the DOT Pipeline Safety Standards in 49 CFR Part 192, 193 or 195. Testing under Part 199 is to be conducted prior to employment, after an accident, randomly and upon reasonable cause. Testing for marijuana, cocaine, opiates, amphetamines and phencyclidine will be performed. 
                  As of August 21, 1990 (Part 199.1 (b)), any job applicant applying for a position covered in this program who refuses or fails a pre-employment drug test will not be hired. Any employee covered by this program who refused or fails a drug test will immediately be removed from the operating, maintenance or emergency response functions covered by the DOT Pipeline Standards in 49 CFR Part 192, 193 or 195. Any employee covered by this program that refuses or fails a drug test may receive disciplinary action, up to and including termination. 
                  In addition, Part 199 requires each operator to provide an Employee Assistance Program (EAP). The EAP is to educate personnel about prohibited drugs, the policy against their use, and the assistance available, and to train supervisors in indications of drug use. 
                  (Ord. No. 91-05, § 1, 11-17-05) 
                  Sec. 2-162. - Types of drug testing. 
                  (a)  Pre-employment testing. A pre-employment drug test will be conducted before an individual is hired or transferred from another department for a covered gas position with the City of Cartersville. An applicant who tests positive does have the right to have their sample re-tested, at their own expense, with reimbursement by the city if such test is negative. City of Cartersville employees transferring into a position requiring drug testing who test positive also have the right to have their samples re-tested. Upon notification that a drug test is required, an employee or applicant will report no later than one-half (½) hour plus travel time after notification to the drug collection site and provide a specimen of urine. 
                  (b)  Random testing. All employees working in a position covered by this program are subject to unannounced testing based on random selection. The operator of the gas system will test at a rate specified by Part 199 Pipeline Regulations of covered employees every twelve (12) months. Random testing will be done on a quarterly basis. Covered employees shall mean those employees performing duties and functions regulated by the Office of Pipeline Safety under Part 192, Transportation of Natural and Other Gas by Pipeline. An employee or applicant will report no later than one-half (½) hour plus travel time after notification to the drug collection site and provide a specimen of urine. 
                  Employees performing the following activities are not covered by this program: Performing accounting, payroll or clerical duties. The random selection procedure will be by computer based numbers that are matched with employee payroll identification numbers. 
                  (c)  Post-accident testing. Employees working in positions covered by this program whose performance either contributed to an accident or cannot be completely discounted, as a contributing factor to the accident will be tested. The employee will be tested as soon as possible, but not later than thirty-two (32) hours after the accident. Accident, in this instance, shall be defined as a reportable incident under Part 191.3 (see Appendix A for Accident Definition), Transportation of Natural and Other Gas by Pipeline; Annual Reports, Incident Reports, and Safety Related Conditions. 
                  All reasonable steps will be taken to obtain a urine sample from an employee after an accident. In the case of conscious, but hospitalized employee, the operator shall request the hospital or medical facility to obtain the sample. If an employee is unconscious or otherwise unable to evidence consent to the procedure, the hospital or medical facility shall collect the sample. If an employee who is subject to post-accident testing is conscious, able to urinate normally (in the opinion of a medical professional), and refuses to be tested, that person shall be removed from duty as an employee. 
                  (d)  Reasonable cause testing. An employee will be drug tested when there is reasonable cause to believe the employee is using a prohibited drug. Examples of reasonable cause are; repeated errors on the job, regulatory or company rule violations, or unsatisfactory time and attendance patterns, if coupled with a specific event that indicated probable drug use. The decision to test must be substantiated by at least one (1) supervisor or the employee and that supervisor must be EAP trained in drug use symptoms. 
                  (e)  Return to duty testing. An employee who, at the recommendation of the medical review officer, returns to work after drug rehabilitation, will be given unannounced drug tests. As scheduled by the medical review officer. These tests will continue for not less than one (1) year and not more than five (5) years. These tests are in addition to the other types of tests stated in this program.

                  Sec. 2-166. - Confidentiality. 
                  Each individual's record of testing and results under this chapter will be private and confidential. With the exception of the MRO, designated safety director, superintendent of gas system, assistant superintendent of the gas system, or upon request of RSPA or state agency officials as part of an accident investigation, the results of individual drug tests will not be released to anyone without the expressed written authorization of the individual tested. Prior to testing, the individual will be informed about who will receive the test data. All written records will be stored in locked files. 
                  (Ord. No. 91-05, § 1, 11-17-05) 
                  Sec. 2-167. - Review and appeal. 
                  Upon report of a positive test, the employee or applicant will be notified of the test results. As part of that notification, he or she will be provided an opportunity to explain any positive results. An employee or applicant whose test results were positive may, at the employee's or applicant's own expense, have a re-test within thirty (30) days of being notified of the original test results. The laboratory used for the re-test shall have chain of custody procedures to ensure proper identification, labeling and handling of test samples and proper exchange with the return of the samples to the original medical group or laboratory. Following review or the appeal process, a final determination will be made by the appropriate authority. Employees who have disciplinary action taken against them as a result of a positive drug test may file a grievance or appeal to the city manager for a hearing.

                  Sec. 2-168. - Access to facilities and records. 
                  The city will not release employee information that is contained in drug or alcohol programs records except as required by law or expressly authorized by the employee. An employee is entitled, upon written request, to obtain copies of any records pertaining to the employee's use of drugs or alcohol, including any test records. In addition, federal, state and local officials will have access to all records and facilities used in complying with drug and alcohol program laws. The city will release an employee's records to a subsequent employer, or other person identified by an employee, upon receipt of a written request from the employee. The subsequent employer or other individual may only disclose the information as expressly authorized by the employee. The city may also provide to employee or decision maker when a grievance or other proceeding has been initiated by or on behalf of the employee which arises from the results of a drug or alcohol test given by the city or from the city's determination that the employee engaged in prohibited conduct. Such proceeding may pertain, for example, to workers' compensation, or other claims or benefits sought by the employee. 
                  Sec. 2-169. - Appendix A (Accident definition). 
                  (1)  An event that involves a release of gas from a pipeline or of gas from an LNG facility; and 
                  (a)  A death, or personal injury necessitating inpatient hospitalization; or 
                  (b)  Estimated property damage, including cost of gas lost, of the operator or others, or both, of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) or more. 
                  (2)  An event that results in an emergency shutdown of an LNG facility. 
                  (3)  An event that is significant, in the judgment of the operator, even though it did not meet the criteria of paragraphs (1) or (2).

                  Sec. 2-170. - Urine Specimen Collection 
                  Chapter 1—Collector: A collector is a trained individual who instructs and assists a donor at a collection site, and makes an initial inspection of the urine specimen provided by a donor, and initiates and completes the Federal Drug Testing Custody and Control Form (CCF). 
                  Any individual, who has received training in conducting the required collection procedure, may serve as a collector except in the following situations: 
                  (a)  The direct supervisor of a particular employee you may not act as the collector when that employee is tested, unless is no feasible alternative; or 
                  (b)  An individual working for an HHS-certified drug testing laboratory may not act as a collector if that individual can link the employee with the specimen drug test result or laboratory report (to allow such an individual to collect such a specimen would compromise the confidentiality of the employee's test result). 
                  A collector should have appropriate identification. The collector is required to provide his or her identification (or collection company identification) if requested by the donor. There is no requirement for the collector to have a picture I.D. or to provide his or her driver's license with an address. Also, the collector is not required to provide any certification or other documentation to the donor proving the collector's training in the collection process. 
                  Note: Although not required, it would benefit the collector to have the agency representative's name and telephone number to call if an unusual situation arises during the collection process. 
                  Chapter 2—Collection site: A collection site is a facility (permanent or temporary) where a donor provides a specimen for a drug test. 
                  A collection site must have: 
                  (1)  A restroom/stall with a toilet for the donor to have privacy while providing the urine specimen. The presence of a toilet is not absolutely necessary when a single-use collection container is used that has sufficient capacity to contain the entire void. Whenever available, a single toilet restroom is preferred. All types of restrooms including a mobile facility (e.g., a vehicle with an enclosed toilet) are acceptable. 
                  (2)  A source of water for washing hands that, if practical, is external to the restroom/stall where urination occurs. If a water source is not available, providing a moist towelette outside the restroom/stall is an acceptable alternative. 
                  (3)  A suitable clean surface for the collector to use as a work area. 
                  Note: The collector's work area must be located outside the restroom. However, if there is no appropriate space available outside the restroom to serve as a secure, clean work area and the restroom is large enough to accommodate a work area, the work area may be located inside the restroom as long as the donor has privacy while providing a urine specimen and the collector is the same gender as the donor. 
                  (4)  Security features to prevent unauthorized access to the site during the collection. 
                  (5)  Features to prevent the donor or anyone else from gaining unauthorized access to the collection materials/supplies. The collector must ensure that the donor does not have access to items that could be used to adulterate or dilute the specimen (e.g., soap, disinfectants, cleaning agents, water). 
                  (6)  Features to provide for the secure handling/storage of specimens from collection until shipment. 
                  Chapter 3—Collection supplies: The following items must be available at the collection site to conduct proper collections: 
                  (1)  Single-use plastic collection containers. Each collection container must be individually sealed using a tamper-evident system (such as, sealed plastic bag, shrink wrap, or another easily visible tamper-evident system), be large enough to easily catch and hold at least fifty-five (55) ml. urine, and have graduated volume markings clearly noting levels of forty-five (45) ml. and above. 
                  (2)  Single-use plastic specimen bottles. Each specimen bottle with cap must be sealed using a tamper-evident system (such as, sealed plastic bag, shrink wrap, or another easily visible tamper-evident system), be large enough to hold at least thirty-five (35) ml. (or they may be two (2) distinct sizes of specimen bottles providing that the bottle designed to hold the primary specimen holds at least thirty-five (35) ml. of urine and the bottle designed to hold the split specimen holds at least twenty (20) ml.), have screw-on or snap-on caps that prevent leakage, have markings clearly indicating the appropriate levels (thirty (30) ml. for the primary specimen and fifteen (15) ml. for the split specimen) of urine to be poured into each bottle, be designed so that the required tamper-evident bottle label/seal on the CCF fits with no damage to the seal when the employee initials it nor with chance that seal overlap would conceal printed information, and be leak resistant. 
                  Note: Two (2) specimen bottles with caps may be sealed together using a single tamper-evident system (such as, shrink wrap) because two (2) specimen bottles are always needed for split specimen collections. 
                  (3)  [Temperature strips.] Temperature strips capable of indicating temperature readings between 90E-100EF (or 32E-38EC). The temperature strips may either be affixed to the collection container as supplied or be affixed to the collection container after the donor gives the specimen collection container to the collector. 
                  (4)  [Federal Drug Testing Custody and Control Forms.] Federal Drug Testing Custody and Control Forms (CCF) approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). 
                  (5)  Tamper-evident seals. Occasionally, the tamper-evident label/seal provided with the CCF will not properly adhere to the specimen bottle because of environmental conditions (e.g., moisture, temperature, specimen bottle material). If this occurs, the collector should have a separate tamper-evident label/seal that can be used to seal the specimen bottle. 
                  (6)  Leak-resistant plastic bags. The plastic bag must have two (2) sealable compartments or pouches (i.e., one (1) large enough to hold two (2) specimen bottles and the other large enough to hold the CCF). 
                  (7)  Absorbent material. The absorbent material is placed with the specimen bottles inside the leak-resistant plastic bag in case a specimen bottle leaks during shipment. 
                  Note: The use of absorbent material is required by the U.S. Postal Service and other express carriers when shipping biological materials. 
                  (8)  Shipping containers. Boxes or bags that are used to transport specimens to the laboratory and can be securely sealed to prevent the possibility of undetected tampering. A shipping container/mailer is not necessary if a laboratory courier hand-delivers the sealed leak-resistant plastic bags containing the specimen bottles directly from the collection site to the laboratory. 
                  (9)  Bluing agent. The bluing agent is added to the toilet bowl/water tank to prevent a donor from diluting the specimen. 
                  (10)  Secure temporary location. If the sealed leak-resistant plastic bag containing the specimen bottles is not immediately placed in a shipping container, the sealed plastic bag must always be maintained within the line of sight of the collector to ensure that no one has access to the specimen until it is placed in a shipping container or it must be placed in a secured temporary location (e.g., inside a refrigerator that can be secured, inside a cabinet that can be secured). If the collector always places the sealed plastic bags immediately into shipping containers, there is no need to have a secure temporary location available at the collection site. 
                  (11)  Disposable gloves. HHS recommends that collectors use single use disposable gloves while handling specimens. The occupational safety and health administration has specific guidelines addressing protection of employees who are exposed to potentially infectious body fluids (29 CFR Part 1910.1030). 
                  Chapter 4—Federal Drug Testing Custody and Control Form All urine specimens must be collected using chain of custody. Chain of custody is the term used to describe the process of documenting the handling and storage of a specimen from the time a donor gives the specimen to the collector to the final disposition of the specimen. For specimens collected under the Mandatory Guidelines, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approved Federal Drug Testing Custody and Control Form (CCF) must be used to document the collection of a specimen at the collection site. The CCF is available from a number of different sources (e.g., laboratories, collectors, MROs) although it is usually provided by the laboratory. 
                  A sample of the CCF (OMB No. 0930-0158, Exp. Date: 6/30/2003) is on the SAMHSA web site (www.health.org/workpl.htm). All discussions throughout this revised handbook refer to this version of the CCF form. 
                  The CCF consists of the following five (5) copies: 
                  Copy 1. Laboratory copy. 
                  Copy 2. Medical review officer copy. 
                  Copy 3. Collector copy. 
                  Copy 4. Employer copy. 
                  Copy 5. Donor copy. 
                  Copy 1 accompanies the specimen to the testing laboratory, Copy 2 is sent to the MRO, Copy 3 is retained by the collector, Copy 4 is sent to the employer, and Copy 5 is given to the donor. 
                  The CCF is completed as follows: 
                  Step 1 - This step is completed by the collector or employer representative. The employer name and address and the MRO name and address may be preprinted or handwritten. The collector will normally enter the donor's social security number after verifying the donor's identity. The collector also marks the appropriate box to indicate the reason for the test and the appropriate box for the drug tests to be performed. The collector then enters the reason for the test and the appropriate box for the drug tests to be performed. The collector then enters information required for the collection site. 
                  Step 2 - This step is completed by the collector after receiving the specimen from the donor and measuring the temperature of the specimen. This step requires the collector to mark the appropriate box to indicate if the temperature of the specimen was within the required temperature range; but also requires the collector to indicate whether it is a split specimen or single specimen collection, to indicate if no specimen was collected and why, or to indicate if it was an observed collection and why. 
                  Step 3 - This step instructs the collector to seal the specimen bottle(s), have the donor initial the bottle seal(s), and then instruct the donor to complete step 5 on the MRO copy (Copy 2). 
                  Step 4 - This step initiated by the collector and then completed by the laboratory after the specimen is accessioned by the laboratory. This step requires the collector to only sign the form once to certify that the specimen was collected, labeled, sealed, and released for shipment to the laboratory in accordance with federal requirements. The collector is also required to note the time of the collection, the date of the collection, and the specific name of the delivery service to whom the specimen is released for shipment to the laboratory. 
                  Note: There is no requirement for couriers, express carriers, or postal service personnel to document chain of custody for the specimens during transit because they do not have access to the specimen(s) or the CCF. Chain of custody annotations resume when the shipping container/package is opened and an individual at the laboratory has access to the specimen bottle(s) and the CCF. 
                  At the laboratory, the accessioner is required to document the condition of the primary specimen bottle seal, sign the CCF, print his/her name, record the date the specimen was accessioned, and indicate to whom the specimen was released. The entry for the "Specimen Bottle(s) Released To" may include transfer to temporary storage or transfer to another individual. After this transfer, chain of custody of the specimen bottle(s) is documented by the laboratory on an internal chain of custody form. 
                  Step 5(a) - This step is completed by the laboratory to document the test results on the primary specimen. 
                  Step 5(b) - This step is completed by the laboratory to report the split specimen result if the split specimen is tested. 
                  The bottom area of Copy 1 is reserved for the tamper-evident specimen bottle seal(s). There must be two (2) labels (i.e., one (1) marked with the letter "A" to designate the primary specimen and the other marked with the letter "B" to designate the split specimen) to accommodate collecting split specimens and each must have the same preprinted specimen identification number that appears at the top of the CCF. Each label must also have a place for the collector to annotate the date of the collection and a place for the donor to initial each label after it is placed on the specimen bottle. If a single specimen collection procedure is used, the second label (i.e., the "B" label) is discarded by the collector. 
                  Chapter 5—Donor identification: The donor must provide appropriate identification to the collector upon arrival at the collection site. Acceptable forms of identification include: 
                  (1)  A photo identification (e.g., drivers license, employee badge). 
                  (2)  Identification by an agency representative; or 
                  (3)  Any other identification allowed under an agency's Workplace drug testing plan. 
                  Unacceptable forms of identification include: 
                  (1)  Identification by a co-worker; 
                  (2)  Identification by another donor; or 
                  (3)  Use of a single non-photo identification card (e.g., social security card, credit card, union or other membership cards, pay vouchers, voter registration card). 
                  Chapter 6—Collection procedure: The following steps describe a typical urine collection procedure under the Mandatory Guidelines: 
                  Step 
                  (1)  The collector prepares the collection site to collect urine specimens. All collection supplies must be available, the area properly secured, water sources secured, and bluing agent placed in all toilets. 
                  Note: If access to a water supply in the restroom cannot be controlled, the collector may tell the donor that he or she will be listening at the entrance to the restroom for any sounds associated with the donor attempting to use the available sources of water. Alternatively, the collector may enter the restroom with the donor if the collector is the same gender as the donor, but remains outside the toilet stall. 
                  (2)  The collector begins the collection without delay after the donor arrives at the collection site. 
                  Note: Do not wait because the donor is not ready, is unable to urinate, or an authorized employer or employee representative is delayed in arriving. 
                  (3)  The collector requests the donor to present an acceptable form of identification as described in Chapter 5. 
                  Note: If the donor cannot satisfy the identification requirement, the collector may proceed with the collection if the donor can provide two (2) items of identification bearing his or her signature. After the donor signs the certification statement, the collector should compare the donor's signature with signatures on the identification that was presented. If the signatures match, the collector lists on the "Remarks" line the two (2) items of identification used to identify the donor and states that "signature identification was confirmed." The collector then continues with the collection process. If the signature does not match the signatures on the two (2) items of identification presented, the collector should state on the "Remarks" line that "signature identification is unconfirmed," discontinue the collection, and notify the collection site supervisor and the agency. 
                  Note: In situations where the donor does not have either photo identification or two (2) other appropriate items of identification that could be used to verify identity and signature, this should not be automatically considered refusal to test. The collector should proceed with the collection. The collector should provide sufficient information on the "Remarks" line to help the MRO and the agency make a determination regarding the validity of the specimen and the collection process. 
                  Note: If the donor asks the collector to provide identification, the collector must show the donor some form of identification. It must include the collector's name and the employer's name, address, and telephone number. It does not have to be a picture identification or include a home address and telephone number. 
                  (4)  The collector reviews the instructions on the back of the CCF with the donor. 
                  (5)  The collector begins entering information and/or ensures that the required information is provided at the top of the CCF (the laboratory name and address and a pre-printed specimen ID number) and in Step 1 of the CCF (employer's name, address, and I.D. number (if applicable), MRO name, address, phone and fax number, donor SSN or employee ID number, reason for test, drug test to be performed, collection site information). 
                  Note: A specific MRO's name and address must appear on the form rather than the name of the clinic or medical facility. 
                  (6)  The collector asks the donor to remove any unnecessary outer clothing (e.g., coat, jacket, hat, etc.) and to leave any briefcase, purse, or other personal belongings he or she is carrying with the outer clothing. The donor may retain his or her wallet. 
                  Note: The donor must not be asked to remove other articles of clothing, such as, shirts, pants, dresses, or under garments. Additionally, the donor must not be requested or required to remove all clothing and wear a hospital or examination gown. 
                  (7)  The collector directs the donor to empty his or her pockets and display the items to ensure that no items are present that could be used to adulterate the specimen. If nothing is there that can be used to adulterate a specimen, the donor places the items back into the pockets and the collection procedure continues. 
                  Note: If an item is found that appears to have been brought to the collection site with the intent to adulterate the specimen, a direct observed collection procedure is used. If the item appears to be inadvertently brought to the collection site, secure the item and continue with the normal collection procedure. 
                  (8)  The collector instructs the donor to wash and dry his or her hands, preferably under the collector's observation and must not wash his or her hands again until after delivering the specimen to the collector. 
                  Note: The donor must not be allowed any further access to water or other materials that could be used to adulterate/dilute the specimen. 
                  (9)  The collector either gives the donor or allows the donor to select the collection container from the available supply. Either the collector or the donor, with both present, then unwraps or breaks the seal of the collection container. 
                  Note: Do not unwrap or break the seal on any specimen bottle at this time. 
                  Note: Do not allow the donor to take anything except the collection container into the room used for urination. 
                  (10)  The collector directs the donor to go into the room used for urination, provide a specimen of at least forty-five (45) ml. (split specimen collection) or thirty (30) ml. (single specimen collection), not to flush the toilet, and return with the specimen as soon as possible after completing the void. 
                  Note: The donor is always permitted to provide a specimen in private unless a direct observed collection has been authorized. 
                  Note: Pay close attention to the donor during the entire collection process to note any conduct that clearly indicates an attempt to substitute or adulterate a specimen. If you detect such conduct, immediately begin a new direct observed collection using a second CCF. Provide an appropriate comment on the "Remarks" line in Step 2 on the first CCF and submit it along with the specimen to the laboratory for testing. This will ensure that the laboratory knows that two (2) separate specimens are being submitted for testing; the first one (1) possibly being adulterated or substituted. Additionally, inform a supervisor that a collection took place under direct observation and the reason for doing so. 
                  (11)  After the donor hands the specimen to the collector, the collector must measure the temperature of the specimen, check the specimen volume, and inspect the specimen for adulteration or substitution. 
                  Temperature. Check the temperature of the specimen within four (4) minutes after the donor hands you the specimen. The acceptable temperature range is 32E-38EC/90E-100EF. Temperature is determined by reading the temperature strip originally affixed to or placed on the outside of the collection container after the donor hands you the specimen. 
                  1.  If the temperature is within the acceptable range, the "Yes" box is marked in Step 2 on the CCF and the collector proceeds with the collection procedure. 
                  2.  If the temperature is outside the acceptable range, the "No" box is marked in Step 2 on the CCF and the collector immediately begins a direct observed collection procedure using a second CCF. The original specimen is sealed and sent with the first CCF to the laboratory with an appropriate comment on the "Remarks" line to indicate that a direct observed specimen was also being collected and submitted to the laboratory. 
                  Specimen volume. Check to make sure that the specimen contains a sufficient amount of urine (i.e., thirty (30) mL for a single specimen collection, forty-five (45) mL for a split specimen collection). 
                  A.  Single specimen collection. If the volume is less than thirty (30) mL, the action taken will depend on whether the temperature of the specimen is in or outside the acceptable range. 
                  1.  If the temperature is in the acceptable range, the specimen is discarded and a second specimen is collected. The collector may use the same CCF for the second specimen, but must use a new specimen collection container. If the donor fails for any reason to provide thirty (30) mL of urine for the second specimen collected, the collector will contact the agency to obtain guidance on the action to be taken. 
                  2.  If the temperature is outside the acceptable range, a second specimen is collected under direct observation and both specimens are sent to the laboratory for testing. The collector must use a separate CCF for each specimen and provide an appropriate comment on each CCF to indicate why two (2) specimens were collected. If the donor fails for any reason to provide thirty (30) mL of urine for the second specimen collected, the collector will contact the agency to obtain guidance on the action to be taken. 
                  Note: In either case when a second specimen is to be collected, HHS permits giving the donor a reasonable amount of fluid to drink to provide a second specimen distributed reasonably through a period of up to three (3) hours, or until the donor has provided a new sufficient amount of urine, whichever occurs first. 
                  B.  Split specimen collection. If the volume is less than thirty (30) mL, the action taken will depend on whether the temperature of the specimen is in or outside the acceptable temperature range. 
                  1.  If the temperature is in the acceptable range, the specimen is discarded and a second specimen is collected. The collector may use the original CCF for the second specimen, but should use a new specimen collection container. If the donor fails to provide forty-five (45) mL for the second specimen collected, the donor forfeits the right to the use of a split specimen collection procedure and the collector submits the second specimen collection with an appropriate comment on the "Remarks" line on the CCF. 
                  2.  If the temperature is outside the acceptable range, a second specimen is collected under the direct observation and both specimens are sent to the laboratory for testing. The collector must use a separate CCF for each specimen and provide an appropriate comment on each CCF to indicate why two (2) specimens were collected. 
                  If the donor fails to provide forty-five (45) mL for the second specimen collected, the donor forfeits the right to the use of a split specimen collection procedure and the collector submits the second specimen as a single specimen collection (regardless of the volume collected) with an appropriate comment on the "Remarks" line on the CCF. 
                  Note: In either case when a second specimen is to be collected, HHS permits giving the donor a reasonable amount of fluid to drink to provide a second specimen distributed reasonably through a period of up to three (3) hours, or until the donor has provided a new sufficient amount of urine, whichever occurs first. 
                  C.  Split specimen collection. If the volume is between thirty (30) and forty-five (45) mL, the action taken will depend on whether the temperature of the specimen is in or outside the acceptable temperature range. 
                  1.  If the temperature is in the acceptable range, all of the urine should be poured into one (1) specimen bottle (Bottle A). Bottle A is sent to the laboratory along with the CCF. The collector should provide an appropriate comment on the "Remarks" line on the CCF that the donor did not provide a sufficient volume of urine for the split (Bottle B) specimen. The donor forfeits the use of a split specimen collection procedure. 
                  2.  If the temperature is outside the acceptable range, a second specimen is collected under direct observation and both specimens are sent to the laboratory for testing. The collector must use a separate CCF for each specimen and provide an appropriate comment on each CCF to indicate why two (2) specimens were collected. 
                  If the donor fails to provide forty-five (45) mL for the second collection, the second specimen is submitted as a single specimen collection and the collector should provide an appropriate comment on the "Remarks" line on the CCF that the donor did not provide a sufficient volume of urine for the split (Bottle B) specimen. The donor forfeits the use of split specimen collection procedure. 
                  Note: HHS permits giving the donor a reasonable amount of fluid to drink to provide a second specimen distributed reasonably through a period of up to three (3) hours, or until the donor has provided a new sufficient amount of urine, whichever occurs first. 
                  Adulteration or substitution. Inspect the specimen for unusual color, presence of foreign objects or material, or other signs of adulteration (e.g., if you notice any unusual odor). If it is apparent from this inspection that the donor has adulterated or substituted the specimen (e.g., the specimen is blue, exhibits excessive foaming when shaken, has smell of bleach), a second collection using direct observation procedures is conducted. The first specimen and the specimen collected using direct observation are both sent to the laboratory for testing. The first specimen is always sent to the laboratory even though it may have had an insufficient volume for either a single or split specimen collection. 
                  If the donor does not provide the required amount of urine for the second collection using direct observation, the collector submits the second specimen as a single specimen collection (regardless of volume) and provides appropriate comments on the "Remarks" line on both CCFs. 
                  Note: When a second specimen is to be collected, HHS permits giving the donor a reasonable amount of fluid to drink to provide a second specimen distributed reasonably through a period of up to three (3) hours, or until the donor has provided a new sufficient amount of urine, whichever occurs first. 
                  Note: Under no circumstances is the collector permitted to collect and add or combine urine from two (2) separate voids. 
                  (12)  The sealed specimen bottle is then unwrapped/opened in the donor's presence after the donor gives the specimen in the collection container to the collector. The collector or the donor may unwrap/open the specimen bottle. 
                  Note: There will be two (2) specimen bottles to be unwrapped/opened if a split specimen was collected. 
                  Note: Both the collector and donor will maintain visual contact of the specimen until the label/seal is placed over the specimen bottle cap/lid. 
                  (13)  The collector pours the specimen from the collection container into a specimen bottle, places the lid/cap on the bottle, and uses the "A" bottle tamper-evident label/seal. The "B" bottle label is discarded. If a split specimen collection procedure is used, the collector pours thirty (30) mL of urine into a specimen bottle, places the lid/cap on the bottle and uses the "A" bottle label/seal. The collector then pours the remaining urine (at least fifteen (15) mL) into a second bottle, places the lid/cap on the bottle, and uses the "B" bottle label/seal. 
                  Note: The tamper-evident label/seal must be placed over the lid/cap to ensure that the lid/cap cannot be removed without destroying the label/seal. The donor must be present to observe the sealing of the specimen bottle(s). 
                  (14)  The collector writes the date on the tamper-evident label(s)/seal(s). The donor is requested to initial the tamper-evident label(s)/seal(s). 
                  Note: Occasionally, the tamper-evident label/seal provided with the CCF will not properly adhere to the specimen bottle because of environmental conditions (e.g., moisture, temperature, specimen bottle material). When this occurs, the collector should still apply the tamper-evident label/seal provided with the CCF and then apply a second, separate tamper-evident seal to seal the specimen bottle. This second seal should be placed perpendicular to the CCF label/seal to avoid obscuring information on the CCF label/seal. This second seal must be initialed and dated by the collector and should be initialed by the donor (i.e., if the donor is still present when it is apparent that the CCF label/seal is not properly adhering to the specimen bottle; however, a label/seal may appear to adhere when initially placed on the bottle, but after several minutes the label/seal begins to lift off along the edges). The collector must also provide an appropriate comment on the "Remarks" line (CCF, Step 2) stating why the second seal was used. 
                  Note: If while sealing and initialing the CCF label/seal the collector or donor accidentally breaks/damages the seal, the collector must apply a second, separate tamper-evident seal to seal the specimen bottle. This second seal should be placed perpendicular to the CCF label/seal to avoid obscuring information on the CCF label/seal. This second seal must be initialed and dated by the collector and initialed by the donor. The collector must also provide an appropriate comment on the "Remarks" line (CCF, Step 2) stating why the second seal was used. 
                  Note: Since the specimen bottle is now sealed with tamper-evident tape and does not have to be under the donor's direct observation, the donor is allowed to wash his or her hands if he or she desires to do so. 
                  (15)  The donor reads the certification statement on Copy 2 of the CCF (Step 5), signs and dates the certification statement, provides date of birth, printed name, and day and evening contact phone numbers. 
                  Note: If the donor refuses to sign the form, the collector must make a notation on the "Remarks" line to that effect. Otherwise, without the collector's comment, a CCF without the donor's signature could result in a canceled test. The same procedure should be followed if the donor refuses to initial the label(s). 
                  (16)  The collector completes the chain of custody on the CCF (Step 4) by printing his or her name, signing where indicated, recording the date and time of the collection, and indicating the specific name of the delivery service to whom the specimen bottle(s) are being released. 
                  (17)  The collector removes Copy 5 from the CCF and gives it to the donor. The donor may now leave the collection site. 
                  Note: At this time, the collector can tell the donor to list any prescription and over-the-counter medications he or she may have recently taken on the back of the donor copy (Copy 5) of the CCF, but not on any other copy. This information will help the donor remember what medications he or she may have taken if a positive result is reported by the laboratory to the MRO. 
                  (18)  The collector places the specimen bottle(s) and Copy 1 of the CCF inside the appropriate pouches of the leak-resistant plastic bag, seals the pouches, and initials and dates the seal. 
                  (19)  The collector places the sealed plastic bag in an appropriate shipping container (e.g., express carrier mailer) and seals the shipping container as appropriate. 
                  Note: If a collector is collecting several specimens within a short period of time, the sealed plastic bags may be placed into a single shipping container. The collector must maintain visual contact of the sealed plastic bags until all plastic bags are sealed in the single shipping container. 
                  Note: The collector must ensure that each specimen is shipped to a laboratory as expeditiously as possible, the same day preferably. 
                  (20)  The collector sends Copy 2 to the MRO and Copy 4 to the employer. Copy 3 is retained by the collector. 
                  The collection procedure is now complete. 
                  Chapter 7—Shy Bladder Procedure: When a donor is unable to provide a urine specimen, the donor may have intentionally urinated prior to arriving at the collection site, could not provide a specimen as directed by the collector, has a physical disability making it impossible to provide a specimen, or has a "shy bladder." The term "shy bladder" usually refers to an individual who is unable to provide a specimen either upon demand or when someone is nearby during the attempted urination. 
                  If a donor tells the collector, upon arrival at the collection site, that he or she cannot provide a specimen, the collector must begin the collection procedure regardless of the reason given. 
                  At the point in the collection procedure where the collector and donor unwrap/open a collection container, the does the following: 
                  (1)  Requests the donor to try to provide a specimen. 
                  Note: The donor demonstrates his or her inability to provide a valid specimen when the donor comes out of the enclosed toilet stall with an empty collection container. 
                  (2)  Directs the donor to drink some fluids. 
                  Note: The donor is given a reasonable amount of fluid to drink distributed reasonably through a period of up to three (3) hours, or until the donor has provided a new sufficient amount of urine, whichever occurs first. 
                  Note: The donor must remain under the direct observation of the collector or an agency representative to prevent the donor from possibly compromising the collection process. 
                  Note: If the donor refuses to drink fluids as directed or refuses to attempt to provide a urine specimen, the collection procedure is discontinued and a "refusal to test" is noted on the "Remarks" line of the CCF. 
                  (3)  Instructs the donor to let you know when he or she is able to provide a sufficient quantity of specimen. The collector uses the CCF from the first attempt. 
                  Note: It is recommended that the collector allow sufficient time to have only one (1) additional attempt rather than having to document several unsuccessful attempts. 
                  (4)  Maintains a record of the time of each attempt, whether there was no specimen provided or the quantity of specimen provided, and the total ounces of fluid given to the donor. 
                  (5)  Discards any inadequate specimen and the collection container that was used for the void, but retains the CCF. 
                  Note: If there was actually no specimen provided on an attempt, the collection container may be used for the next attempt. 
                  (6)  Discontinues the collection procedure and notifies the agency of a potential "shy bladder" situation if after a period of three (3) hours (i.e., from the time the donor first demonstrated that he or she was unable to provide a sufficient quantity of specimen) the donor is still unable to provide an adequate specimen. 
                  (7)  Indicates "Shy Bladder" on the "Remarks" line of the CCF and attaches a copy of the record documenting the attempts to collect a specimen. Copy 1 is discarded since no valid specimen was collected and the other copies of the CCF are distributed as appropriate. 
                  If the donor does not provide the required amount of urine for the second collection using direct observation, the collector submits the second specimen as a single specimen collection (regardless of the volume) and provides appropriate comments on the "Remarks" line on both CCFs. 
                  Note: When a second specimen is to be collected, HHS permits giving the donor a reasonable amount of fluid to drink to provide a second specimen distributed reasonably through a period of up to three (3) hours, or until the donor has provided a new sufficient amount of urine, whichever occurs first. 
                  Note: Under no circumstance is the collector permitted to collect and add or combine urine from two (2) separate voids. 
                  (8)  The sealed specimen bottle is then unwrapped/opened in the donor's presence after the donor gives the specimen in the collection container to the collector. The collector or the donor may unwrap/open the specimen bottle. 
                  Note: There will be two (2) specimen bottles to be unwrapped/opened if a split specimen was collected. 
                  Note: Both the collector and donor will maintain visual contact of the specimen until the label/seal is placed over the specimen bottle cap/lid. 
                  (9)  The collector pours the specimen from the collection/container into a specimen bottle, places the lid/cap on the bottle, and uses the "A" bottle tamper-evident label/seal. The "B" bottle label is discarded. If a split specimen collection procedure is used, the collector pours thirty (30) mL of urine into a specimen bottle, places the lid/cap on the bottle and uses the "A" bottle/seal. The collector then pours the remaining urine (at least fifteen (15) mL) into a second bottle, places the lid/cap on the bottle, and uses the "B" bottle label/seal. 
                  Note: The tamper-evident label/seal must be placed over the lid/cap to ensure that the lid/cap cannot be removed without destroying the label/seal. The donor must be present to observe the sealing of the specimen bottle(s). 
                  (10)  The collector writes the date on the tamper-evident label(s)/seal(s). The donor is requested to initial the tamper-evident label(s)/seal(s). 
                  Note: Occasionally, the tamper-evident label/seal provided with the CCF will not properly adhere to the specimen bottle because of environmental conditions (e.g., moisture, temperature, specimen bottle material). When this occurs, the collector should still apply the tamper-evident label/seal provided with the CCF and then apply a second, separate tamper-evident seal to seal the specimen bottle.

                  (11)  The donor reads the certification statement on Copy 2 of the CCF (Step 5), signs and dates the certification statement, provides date of birth, printed name, and day and evening contact phone numbers. 
                  Note: If the donor refuses to sign the form, the collector must make a notation on the "Remarks" line to that effect.

                  (14)  The collector places the specimen bottle(s) and Copy 1 of the CCF inside the appropriate pouches of the leak-resistant plastic bag, seals the pouches, and initials and dates the seal. 
                  (15)  The collector places the sealed plastic bag in an appropriate shipping container (e.g., express carrier mailer) and seals the shipping container as appropriate. 
                  Note: If a collector is collecting several specimens within a short period of time, the sealed plastic bags may be placed into a single shipping container.

                  (16)  The collector sends Copy 2 to the MRO and Copy 4 to the employer. Copy 3 is retained by the collector. 
                  The collection procedure is now complete. 
                  Chapter 8—Direct Observed Collection: A direct observed collection procedure is the same as a routine collection procedure with the additional requirement that an observer physically watches the donor urinate into the collection container. 
                  The use of an observer may occur only when: 
                  (1)  A previous drug test was reported either positive for a drug, dilute, adulterated, substituted, unsuitable for testing, or canceled because the split specimen was not tested; 
                  (2)  The drug test is a return-to-duty or a follow-up test; 
                  (3)  The agency/employer believes that the donor may alter or substitute the specimen to be provided; or 
                  (4)  During a routine collection, the temperature of the specimen collected is outside the acceptable range, the collector observed materials brought to the collection site or donor conduct indicated a possible attempt to adulterate or substitute a specimen, or the collector believes that the specimen has been adulterated (e.g., the specimen is blue, exhibits excessive foaming when shaken, has smell of bleach). 
                  Note: The observer must be the same gender as the donor even if the observer has a medical background/training. 
                  The collector may serve as the observer when the collector is the same gender as the donor. If not, the collector must call upon another individual (who is the same gender as the donor) to act as the observer. 
                  Note: With regard to chain of custody, the observer must never touch/handle the collection container. 
                  After the donor has completed urinating into the collection container, the donor and observer leave the enclosed toilet stall/restroom and the donor hands the collection container directly to the collector. 
                  Note: The observer must maintain visual contact of the collection container until the donor hands the container to the collector. 
                  Note: If the observer and collector are one (1) and the same, the collector may receive the collection container from the donor while they are both in the enclosed toilet stall/restroom. 
                  The collector continues with the collection procedure, checks the box for an observed collection in Step 2 on the CCF, and provides the name of the observer and the reason for an observed collection on the "Remarks" line in Step 2 on the CCF. A separate sheet explaining the use of an observed collection may be attached to the CCF if there is insufficient room on the "Remarks" line. 
                  Chapter 9—Blind samples: Each federal agency is required to have some blind samples (negative and positive spiked samples) submitted along with the donor specimens. 
                  The blind samples are either purchased by the agency and given to the collector or the collector, third party administrator, or MRO purchases the blind samples from a supplier and submits the blind samples along with agency's donor specimens. 
                  A blind sample is always submitted using the same CCF as that used for a donor specimen. The collector provides the required information to ensure that the CCF has been properly completed as well as providing fictitious initials on the specimen bottle label/seal. Since there is no donor, the collector must indicate that the sample is a "blind sample" on the MRO copy where the donor would normally provide a signature (Step 5 on Copy 2 of the CCF). 
                  Note: For a blind sample, Copy 5 of the CCF (the donor copy) may be discarded by the collector. 
                  Note: If a federal agency/employer collects "split specimens" for its workplace drug testing program, the blind samples must also be submitted as "split specimens". 
                  Chapter 10—Documentation errors/fatal flaws: When an HHS certified laboratory receives a specimen bottle(s) and its associated CCF, it checks to see if the specimen ID number on the specimen bottle label/seal matches the number on the CCF, that the specimen bottle seal is intact, and that the CCF has been properly completed by the collector. If there is any discrepancy and/or error of omission (e.g., the collector did not sign the chain of custody, the collector did not check one (1) of the specimen temperature boxes), the laboratory will contact the collector to determine if the discrepancy and/or missing information can be recovered. That is, the collector can provide a written memorandum attesting to the fact that he or she did actually carry out the required action but inadvertently forget to properly document the CCF. 
                  Note: If a memorandum cannot be provided by the collector to recover the discrepancy or error of omission, the laboratory will report "Rejected for Testing" to the MRO and provide an appropriate comment as to why the specimen was not tested. 
                  Note: Once contacted by the laboratory, the collector should immediately respond to the laboratory indicating whether it can or cannot provide a memorandum to recover the discrepancy and/or error of omission. HHS recommends that laboratories retain these specimens for a minimum of five (5) business days before they may be discarded. 
                  Chapter 11—Regulated and non-regulated employers: Federal agencies and employers regulated by the department of transportation (DOT) are required to use the OMB approved Federal Drug Testing Custody and Control Form for their workplace drug testing programs. All other employers, private sector companies, states, department of justice programs, and the non-DOT testing conducted by DOT regulated employers are considered "non-regulated" with respect to complying with the HHS Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs or the DOT Workplace Drug and Alcohol Testing Programs and are prohibited from using the Federal CCF. 
                  In the rare instance where the collector, either by mistake or as the only means to conduct a test under difficult circumstances (e.g., post-accident test with insufficient time to obtain the CCF), uses a non-federal form for a regulated collection, the use of a non-federal form does, in and of itself, present a reason for the laboratory to reject the specimen for testing or for the MRO to cancel the test. However, if the laboratory or the MRO discovers the use of the incorrect form, a signed statement must be obtained from the collector stating the reason why the Federal CCF was not used for the regulated collection.

The system at its discretion may send the employee to a substance abuse professional. 
                  (Ord. No. 92-05, § 1, 11-17-05) 
                  Sec. 2-185. - When testing must occur. 
                  (a)  Alcohol testing must be performed on four (4) occasions: 
                  (1)  When there has been an accident (post-accident testing). 
                  (2)  When there is reasonable suspicion that one (1) or more alcohol-affected employees may pose a danger to themselves and others in their job performance. (reasonable-suspicion testing). 
                  (3)  When an employee returns to duty after engaging in prohibited conduct (return-to-duty testing). 
                  (4)  Following the return to work of a covered employee who has received assistance in resolving problems associated with alcohol misuse (follow-up testing). The covered employee will be subject to a reasonable program of following-up testing, without prior notice, for up to sixty (60) months after his or her return to duty. 
                  (b)  The requirements for each type of testing are as follows: 
                  (1)  Post-accident testing. 
                  a.  Following an accident, as defined in the definition section of this procedure, the system will promptly test each surviving covered employee for alcohol if that employee's performance contributed to the accident. 
                  b.  The decision not to administer an alcohol test under this section will be based on the system's determination, using the best available information at the time of the determination, that the employee's performance could not have contributed to the accident. 
                  c.  Each employee involved is required to submit to an alcohol test within two (2) hours of the accident. If a test is not administered within eight (8) hours following the accident, the system will stop trying to conduct an alcohol test and will prepare and keep on file a written report explaining why the alcohol test was not conducted. 
                  d.  An employee who is subject to post-accident testing and who fails to remain readily available for such testing—Including notifying his supervisor of his/her location if he/she leaves the scene of the accident prior to submission to an alcohol test—May be deemed to have refused to submit to testing. 
                  e.  The employee must remain available for alcohol testing and may not consume any alcohol for eight (8) hours following the accident or until the alcohol test has been conducted. Employees should, however, seek and obtain emergency medical care whenever necessary. 
                  (1)  Reasonable-suspicion testing. 
                  a.  Reasonable-suspicion testing is designed (in conjunction with supervisor training on the signs and symptoms of alcohol misuse) to identify alcohol-affected employees who may pose a danger to themselves and others in their job performance. Employees may be at work in a condition that raises concern regarding their safety or productivity. Supervisors will make a decision as to whether there is a reasonable suspicion to believe an employee is using or has used alcohol. 
                  b.  A determination by the system that reasonable suspicion of alcohol use exists and to require a covered employee to undergo an alcohol test will be based on specific, stated observations concerning the appearance, behavior, speech, or body odors of the employee at the time. The required observations will be made by a supervisor who has received at least sixty (60) minutes of training in detecting the symptoms of alcohol misuse and will be documented. 
                  c.  If a reasonable-suspicion test is not administered within two (2) hours following the determination, the System will prepare and keep on file a record stating the reasons why the test was not promptly administered. If the required test is not administered within eight (8) hours of the determination, the system will stop trying to administer an alcohol test and will state in the record the reason for not administering the test. Upon request such records will be made available to any person who has been delegated authority in the matter concerned. 
                  d.  The system will not permit a covered employee to report for duty or remain on duty requiring the performance of covered functions while the employee is under the influence of or impaired by alcohol, as shown by the behavioral, speech, or performance indicators of alcohol misuse. 
                  (3)  Return-to-duty testing. 
                  a.  If a substance abuse professional consulted in the case makes a determination that some form of evaluation and/or treatment is required, then the employee must comply with the recommended provisions in order to be considered eligible to return-to-duty. 
                  b.  Before an employee may return to duty to perform covered functions after engaging in prohibited conduct, the system will ensure that the employee undergoes a return-to-duty alcohol test with a result indicating an alcohol concentration of less than 0.02. 
                  (4)  Follow-up testing. 
                  a.  Following the determination that a covered employee is in need of assistance in resolving problems associated with alcohol misuse, the employee will be subject to unannounced follow-up testing as directed by a Substance Abuse Professional (SAP). An employee who returns to duty will be subject to a reasonable program of follow-up testing, without prior notice, for up to sixty (60) months after his or her return-to-duty. 
                  b.  The employee will be subject to at least six (6) unannounced alcohol follow-up tests during the first twelve (12) months following his or her return to duty. The SAP assigned may terminate the requirement for follow-up testing any time after the initial six (6) tests have been completed if the SAP makes the determination that such testing is no longer warranted. 
                  c.  The system may require a covered employee to submit to alcohol follow-up testing when the SAP assigned has reason to suspect alcohol involvement. 
                  (Ord. No. 92-05, § 1, 11-17-05) 
                  Sec. 2-186. - Prohibited alcohol-related conduct. 
                  The use or possession of alcoholic beverage(s) while on the system, or in any system vehicle, or on system time, including breaks or lunches, paid or unpaid, on any shift, is strictly prohibited. 
                  (1)  Alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater. Covered employees are prohibited from reporting for duty or remaining on duty requiring the performance of covered functions while having an alcohol concentration of four hundredths (0.04) greater (which means 0.04 grams or more of alcohol per two hundred ten (210) liters of breath). If the system representative has actual knowledge that a covered employee has an alcohol concentration of four hundredths (0.04) or greater, the employee will not be permitted to perform or continue to perform covered functions. 
                  (2)  Pre-duty use within four (4) hours. Covered employees may not use alcohol within four (4) hours prior to performing covered functions, or, if an employee is called to duty to respond to an emergency, within the time period after the employee has been notified to report for duty. If a system representative has actual knowledge that a covered employee has used alcohol within four (4) hours to performing covered functions or within the time period after the employee has been notified to report for duty, the employee will not be permitted to perform or continue to perform covered functions. 
                  (3)  On-duty use. Covered employees shall not use alcohol while performing covered functions. If a system representative has actual knowledge that a covered employee is using alcohol while performing covered functions, the employee will not be permitted to perform or continue to perform covered functions.

                  Sec. 2-188. - Disciplinary actions for alcohol misuse. 
                  (a)  A covered employee who has an alcohol test administered and is found to have alcohol concentration of four hundredths (0.04) or greater will be terminated. A covered employee who has violated the prohibitions on alcohol misuse and has been terminated will not be reconsidered for re-employment by the system for a period of one (1) year. 
                  (b)  A covered employee who has an alcohol test administered and is found to have alcohol concentration greater that two hundredths (0.02) but less than four hundredths (0.04) will not be permitted to perform covered functions or continue to perform covered functions until: 
                  (1)  An alcohol test is administered and the employee's alcohol concentration measures less than two hundredths (0.02); or 
                  (2)  The start of the employee's next regularly scheduled duty period, but no less than eight (8) hours following the determination that there is reasonable suspicion to believe that the employee has violated the prohibitions as contained in this procedure. 
                  (c)  An employee who refuses to submit to an alcohol test without valid medical explanation after he or she has received notice of the requirement to be tested in accordance with the requirements of this procedure, or who engages in conduct that clearly obstructs the testing procedure, will be terminated from employment. 
                  (d)  On duty or possession of alcohol on the systems time or premises will result in termination of employment. 
                  (e)  When an employee has tested for alcohol in a concentration of two hundredths (0.02) or greater, but less than four hundredths (0.04), that employee will be removed from performing any covered function and suspended without pay for the remainder of his or her shift.

                  Sec. 2-189. - Review and appeal. 
                  Upon report of a positive test, the employee or applicant will be notified of the test results. As part of that notification, he or she will be provided an opportunity to explain any positive results. An employee or applicant whose test results were positive may, at the employee's or applicant's own expense, have a re-test within thirty (30) days of being notified of the original test results. The laboratory used for the re-test shall have a chain of custody procedures to ensure proper exchange with the return of the samples to the original medical group or laboratory. Following review or the appeal process, a final determination will be made by the appropriate authority. Employees who have disciplinary action taken against them as a result of a positive drug test may file a grievance or appeal to the city manager for a hearing.

                  (e)  A covered employee is entitled, upon written request, to obtain copies of any records pertaining to alcohol tests. The system will promptly provide the requested records. Access to an employee's records will not be contingent upon payment for records other than those specifically requested. 
                  (f)  The system will make records available to a subsequent employer upon receipt of the written request from any covered employee. Disclosure by the subsequent employer is permitted only as expressly authorized by the terms of the employee's written request. 
                  (g)  The system may disclose required information pertaining to a covered employee to the employee or the decision maker in a lawsuit, grievance, or other proceeding initiated by or on behalf of the individual, and arising from the results of an alcohol test administered as required by this procedure and the regulations set forth in 49 CFR Parts 199 or 40 or from the system's determination that the covered employee engaged in prohibited alcohol-related conduct including but not limited to, a worker's compensation, unemployment compensation, or other proceeding relating to a benefit sought by the employee.

                  Sec. 2-193. - Alcohol testing. 
                  Subpart L—Alcohol screening tests. 
                  § 40.241. What are the first steps in any alcohol screening test? 
                  As the BAT or STT you will take the following steps to begin all alcohol screening tests, regardless of the type of testing device you are using: 
                  a)  When a specific time for an employee's test has been scheduled, or the collection site is at the employee's worksite, and the employee does not appear at the collection site at the scheduled time, contact the DER to determine the appropriate interval within which the DER has determined the employee is authorized to arrive. If the employee's arrival is delayed beyond that time, you must notify the DER that the employee has not reported for testing. In a situation where a C/TPA has notified an owner/operator or other individual employee to report for testing and the employee does not appear, the C/TPA must notify the employee that he or she has refused to test. 
                  b)  Ensure that, when the employee enters the alcohol testing site, you begin alcohol testing process without undue delay. For example, you must not wait because the employee says he or she is not ready or because an authorized employer or employee representative is delayed in arriving. 
                  1.  If the employee is also going to take a DOT drug test, you must, to the greatest extent practicable, ensure that the alcohol test is completed before the urine collection process begins. 
                  2.  If the employee needs medical attention (e.g., an injured employee in an emergency medical facility who is required to have a post-accident test), do not delay this treatment to conduct a test. 
                  c)  Require the employee to provide positive identification. You must see a photo ID issued by the employer (other than in the case of an owner-operator or other self-employer individual) or a Federal, State, or local government (e.g., a driver's license). You may not accept faxes or photocopies of identification. Positive identification by an employer representative (not a co-worker or another employee being tested) is also acceptable. If the employee cannot produce positive identification, you must contact DER to verify the identity of the employee. 
                  d)  If the employee asks, provide your identification to the employee. Your identification must include your name and your employer's name but is not required to include your picture, address, or telephone number. 
                  e)  Explain the testing procedure to the employee, including showing the employee the instructions on the back of the ATF. 
                  f)  Complete Step 1 of the ATF. 
                  g)  Direct the employee to complete Step 2 on the ATF and sign the certification. If the employee refuses to sign this certification, you must document this refusal on the "Remarks" line of the ATF and immediately notify the DER. This is a refusal to test. 
                  Subpart L—Alcohol screening tests. 
                  § 40.25. What is the procedure for an alcohol screening test using a saliva ASD or a breath tube ASD? 
                  a)  As the STT or BAT, you must take the following steps when using the saliva ASD: 
                  1.  Check the expiration date on the device or package containing the device and show it to the employee. You may not use the device after the expiration date. 
                  2.  Open the individually wrapped or sealed package containing the device in the presence of the employee. 
                  3.  Offer the employee the opportunity to use the device. If the employee uses it, you must instruct the employee to insert it into his or her mouth and use it in a manner described by the device's manufacturer. 
                  4.  If the employee chooses not to use the device, or in all cases which a new test is necessary because the device did not activate (see paragraph (a)(7) of this section), you must insert the device into the employee's mouth and gather saliva in the manner described by the device's manufacturer. You must wear single-use examination or similar gloves while doing so and change them following each test. 
                  5.  When the device is removed from the employee's mouth, you must follow the manufacturer's instructions regarding necessary next steps in ensuring that the device has activated. 
                  6.  (i)  If you were unable to successfully follow the procedures of paragraphs (a)(3) through (a)(5) of this section (e.g., the device breaks, you drop the device on the floor), you must discard the device and conduct a new test using a new device. 
                  (ii)  The new device you use must be one that has been under your control or that of the employee before the test. 
                  (iii)  You must note on the "Remarks" line of the ATF the reason for the new test. (Note: You may continue using the same ATF with which you began the test.) 
                  (iv)  You must offer the employee the choice of using the device or having you use it unless the employee, in the opinion of the STT or BAT, was responsible (e.g., the employee dropped the device) for the new test needing to be conducted. 
                  (v)  If you are unable to successfully follow the procedures of paragraphs (a)(3) through (a)(5) of this section on the new test, you must end the collection and put an explanation on the "Remarks" line of the ATF. 
                  (vi)  You must then direct the employee to take a new test immediately, using an EBT for the screening test. 
                  7.  If you are unable to successfully follow the procedures of paragraphs (a)(3)—(a)(5) of this section, but the device does not activate, you must discard the device and conduct a new test, in the same manner as provided in paragraph (a)(6) of this section. In this case, you must place the device into the employee's mouth to collect saliva for the new test. 
                  8.  You must read the result displayed on the device no sooner than the device's manufacturer instructs. In all cases the result displayed must be read within fifteen (15) minutes of the test. You must then show the device and it's reading to the employee and enter the result on the ATF. 
                  9.  You must never re-use devices, swabs, gloves or other materials used in saliva testing. 
                  10.  You must note the fact that you used a saliva ASD in Step 3 of the ATF. 
                  (b)  As the STT or BAT, you must take the following steps when using the breath tube ASD: 
                  1.  Check the expiration date on the device or on the package containing the device and show it to the employee. You must not use the device after its expiration date. 
                  2.  Remove a device from the package and break the tube's ampule in the presence of the employee. 
                  3.  Secure an inflation bag onto the appropriate end of the device, as directed by the manufacturer on the device's instructions. 
                  4.  Offer the employee the opportunity to use the device. If the employee chooses to use (e.g., hold) the device, instruct the employee to blow forcefully and steadily into the blowing end of device until the inflation bag fills with air (approximately twelve (12) seconds). 
                  5.  If the employee chooses not to hold the device, you must hold it and provide the use instructions in paragraph (b)(4) of this section. 
                  6.  When the employee completes the breath process, take the device from the employee (or if you were holding it, remove it from the employee's mouth); remove the inflation bag; and either hold the device or place it on a clean flat surface while waiting for the reading to appear. 
                  7.  (i)  If you were unable to successfully follow the procedures of paragraphs (b)(4) through (b)(6) of this section (e.g., the device breaks apart, the employee did not fill the inflation bag), you must discard the device and conduct a new test using a new one. 
                  (ii)  The new device you use must be one that has been under your control or that of the employer before the test. 
                  (iii)  You must note on the "Remarks" line of the ATF the reason for the new test. (Note: You may continue using the same ATF with which you began the test.) 
                  (iv)  You must offer the employee the choice of holding the device or having you hold it unless the employee, in your opinion, was responsible (e.g., the employee failed to fill the inflation bag) for the new test needing to be conducted. 
                  (v)  If you are unable to successfully follow the procedures of paragraphs (b)(4) through (b)(6) of this section on the new test, you must end collection and put an explanation on the "Remarks" line of the ATF. 
                  (vi)  You must then direct the employee to take a new test immediately, using another type of ASD (e.g., saliva device) or an EBT. 
                  8.  If you were able to successfully follow the procedures of paragraphs (b)(4) through (b)(6) of this section, you must compare the color of the crystals in the device with the colored crystals on the manufacturer-produced control tube no sooner than the manufacturer instructs. In all cases color comparisons must take place within fifteen (15) minutes of the test. 
                  9.  You must follow the manufacturer's instructions for determining the result of the test. You must then show both the device and the control tube side-by-side to the employee and record the result on the ATF. 
                  10.  You must never re-use devices or gloves used in breath tube testing. The inflation bag must be voided of air following removal from a device. One (1) inflation bag can be used for up to ten (10) breath tube tests. 
                  11.  You must note the fact that you used a breath tube device in Step 3 of the ATF. {67 FR 61522, Oct. 1, 2002}

                  Sec. 2-211. - Purpose. 
                  The City of Cartersville has a public trust to provide a variety of services to the community. An efficient and productive work force is vital to carry out that trust. The public has a reasonable right to expect persons employed by the city to perform their duties free from the effects of drugs, including alcohol. 
                  The city has an obligation to ensure public safety through the actions of its employees. Furthermore, employees of the city have a reasonable right to work in a safe environment free from the effects of drug use. The city has a reasonable right to expect employees to report for work fit for duty, free from the effects of drug use. 
                  The city recognizes that an employee's physical condition affects job performance, and that drug abuse ranks as one (1) of the major health problems in our society. It is the intent of this policy to express the city's viewpoint on drug usage exhibited by behavioral and medical disorders, to encourage an enlightened viewpoint toward these disorders, and to provide guidelines for consistent handling of situations arising from such disorders.

                  Sec. 2-212. - Definitions. 
                  As used in this article, the following terms shall have the following meanings, unless the context clearly indicates that different meaning is intended. 
                  City: The City of Cartersville, Georgia, a municipal corporation of the State of Georgia. 
                  Controlled substance: Any of those substances listed under the Uniform Controlled Substances Act of the State of Georgia.

                  Intoxicating substance: Any substance which produces changes on one's physical, mental, or emotional state or behavior, including but not limited to glue, paint thinner, etc. 
                  Possession: Having controlled substances which are not obtained either directly from a doctor or pharmacist using a valid prescription, or having controlled substances, the possession or use of which is unlawful pursuant to the laws of the State of Georgia or any federal law or regulation.

For the purposes of this definition, a blood alcohol level of .08 percent alcohol in the blood by weight shall be considered to be sufficient to establish an employee is under the influence. However, an employee with a blood alcohol level of less than .08 percent alcohol in the blood by weight may also be considered under the influence of alcohol if job performance is impaired to any appreciable degree.

                  (Ord. No. 94-05, § 1, 11-17-05) 
                  Sec. 2-213. - Rules and regulations. 
                  The City of Cartersville is concerned with those situations where use of alcohol, intoxicating substances, or other drugs is detrimental to the public trust or to the safety of employees or citizens. The city is committed to the rehabilitation of employees who abuse drugs and alcohol by referral. 
                  Early recognition and treatment of chemical dependency problems is important for successful rehabilitation to improve job performance and reduce personal, family, and social disruption. Employees who participate in a program for the purpose of treating alcoholism or drug addiction may do so without jeopardizing their employment with the city, provided they stop all involvement with alcohol or other drugs. Participation in such programs will not automatically prevent disciplinary action for incidents that have already occurred. Should a rehabilitation program be necessary, leaves of absence must be used in accordance with current policies. 
                  To implement this policy, the following rules are established as conditions of employment with the city. 
                  (1)  The city will not hire any applicant who tests positive on a detection test for illegal drugs or alcohol. Those individuals will be prohibited from employment with the city for one (1) year, unless they provide certified documentation of successful completion of a substance abuse rehabilitation program. Applicant who has completed a rehabilitation program will be subject to drug screening prior to being employed. 
                  (2)  Any city employee who is involved in a reportable incident (see definitions) that results in injury to persons or property shall be subject to an investigation. Employees will be directed to undergo a drug or alcohol detection test to aid in determining fitness for duty if there is reasonable suspicion that the employee was under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of the incident. An employee who refused to participate in a required drug or alcohol detection test will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. 
                  (3)  Based on the results of the investigation and drug or alcohol detection testing, the employee may be subject to disciplinary action in accordance with departmental or city guidelines, and established practices for various infractions. 
                  (4)  If enrollment in a drug or alcohol rehabilitation program is required; employees will be referred to the city manager.

                  Sec. 2-214. - Exemption for prescribed medical treatment. 
                  The use of legally controlled substances as part of a prescribed medical treatment by a licensed physician will not subject an employee to disciplinary action or denial of employment if that treatment does not adversely affect job performance. Prescribed use must be substantiated by a physician's report or statement. If the use of prescribed drugs adversely affects an employee's job performance or is detrimental to the public trust or safety of other employees or citizens, it is in the best interest of the employee and the city for the employee to be placed on a leave of absence. Leaves of absence will be used in accordance with current policies.

                  Sec. 2-215. - Screening process. 
                  In keeping with the city's goal to establish and maintain a work environment free from the effects of drugs and intoxicating substances, and to insure the safety of citizens, the work place and the work force, the following procedures as established: 
                  (1)  For designated positions, applicants who have received an offer of employment must successfully complete a drug and alcohol detection test in addition to successful completion of any other physical examination requirements. A positive finding of alcohol or illegal drugs will result in denial of employment with the city. 
                  (2)  Applicants for designated positions who do not submit to screening at the appointed time will be denied employment. 
                  (3)  The safety director at the request of department heads, with input from the immediate supervisor, shall initiate drug or alcohol screening of employees involved in reportable incidents (see definitions) that result in injury to person or property, if there is reasonable suspicion of substance abuse. 
                  (4)  Drug or alcohol testing of employees may be initiated by department heads, when there is a reasonable suspicion that substance abuse is occurring. The safety director shall be consulted, if possible, before ordering a test. 
                  (5)  For purposes of drug or alcohol testing under subsections (3) and (4) above, a determination of reasonable suspicion that a person is under the influence of drugs or alcohol includes, but not limited to, any of the following criteria: 
                  An employee seems disoriented; confirmed reports from police, citizens or other employees of drug or alcohol use or abnormal, potentially dangerous behavior, medical or physical information such as track marks; absenteeism or tardiness; any articulate facts which lead supervisors or department heads to believe an employee is in possession of drugs or alcohol; or is under the influence of drugs or alcohol; or the accumulation of facts that indicate an employee, because of alcohol or drug abuse, is unfit for duty. (The areas of observation listed in Exhibit B at the end of this article and by the reference made a part hereof, will be used as a guide for such determination.) 
                  Drug or alcohol screening of applicants or employees will include any approved DOT test method. The consent form to be used for each such test is Exhibit C at the end of this article and by this reference made a part hereof. Any positive readings following urine testing will be confirmed by an alternative testing method before any management action is taken. 
                  The tests designed to detect drugs most commonly abused. Listed below are nine (9) drug groups that are identified by the use of the test: 
                  Alcohol 
                  Amphetamines 
                  Barbiturates 
                  Cocaine/Metabolite 
                  Methaqualone 
                  Phencyclidine (PCP) 
                  Opiates 
                  Benzodiazepines 
                  Cannabinoides (THC) 
                  These drug groups were selected based on known abuse in the community and the ability of each drug to adversely affect physical and mental performance. As new or existing drugs develop into abuse problems, they shall be included in the screening when technically and financially feasible. All positive urine or blood samples will be retained by the laboratory for one (1) year, or longer if an appeal or court action is in process. 
                  (Ord. No. 94-05, § 1, 11-17-05) 
                  Sec. 2-216. - Review and appeal. 
                  Upon report of a positive test, the employee or applicant will be notified of the test results. As part of that notification, he or she will be provided an opportunity to explain any positive results. An employee or applicant whose test results were positive may, at the employee's or applicant's own expense, have a re-test conducted of the original sample at a laboratory of the employee's choice that has been pre-approved by the city. An employee or applicant shall request such re-test within thirty (30) days of being notified of the original test results. The laboratory used for the re-test shall have a chain of custody procedures to ensure proper identification, labeling and handling of test samples and proper exchange with the return of the samples to the original medical group or laboratory. Following review or the appeal process, a final determination will be made by the appropriate authority. Employees who have disciplinary action taken against them as a result of a positive drug test may file a grievance to the city manager for a hearing. 
                  (Ord. No. 94-05, § 1, 11-17-05) 
                  Sec. 2-217. - Implementation. 
                  (a)  Substance abuse screening will be conducted by certified technicians of breath alcohol testing devices or by the medical group or groups responsible for administering pre-employment physical examinations. The integrity of the urine or blood sample being tested or the breath test record card will be ensured by an explicit chain of custody procedures developed by the substance abuse mental health administration. Any testing, testing-related documents, and test results will be kept confidential and will only be released to the safety director or city manager. Further disclosures of such information is prohibited unless written authorization is obtained from the employee or applicant. Any breach of confidentially will subject the employee responsible to disciplinary action up to and including termination. 
                  (b)  The safety director will assist supervisors in policy implementation, day-to-day administration, and with disciplinary action arising from implementation of the policy. 
                  (c)  A training program will be provided to assist supervisory personnel in identifying drug and alcohol use among employees. The training will be directed towards helping supervisors recognize the conduct and behavior that give rise to a reasonable suspicion of drug or alcohol use. 
                  (d)  The safety director will be responsible for scheduling the screening of applicants and employees during normal working hours. the safety director, personnel director, and assistant to the city manager will schedule screening during night shift working hours. 
                  (e)  This policy is intended to be a unilateral expression of the general policies, procedures and guidelines concerning substance abuse. It is not intended to create any contractual rights of employment, whether express or implied, between the city and its employees. The city reserves the right to change the provisions of this policy at any time. 
                  (Ord. No. 94-05, § 1, 11-17-05) 
                  Sec. 2-218. - Access to facilities and records. 
                  The city will not release employee information that is contained in drug or alcohol programs records except as required by law or expressly authorized by the employee. An employee is entitled, upon written request, to obtain copies of any records pertaining to the employee's use of drugs or alcohol, including test records. In addition, federal, state, and local officials will have access to all records and facilities used in complying with drug and alcohol program laws. The city will release an employee's records to a subsequent employer, or other person identified by an employee, upon receipt of a written request from the employee. The subsequent employer or other individual may only disclose the information as expressly authorized by the employee. The city may also provide information to employee or decision-maker when a grievance or other proceeding has been initiated by or on behalf of the employee which arises from the results of a drug or alcohol test given by the city or from the city's determination that the employee engaged in prohibited conduct. Such proceeding may pertain, for example to workers' compensation, or other claims or benefits sought by the employee. _____

                  --- (11) --- 
                  Editor's note— Ord. No. 93-05, § 1, adopted November 17, 2005, repealed the former Art. VIII, §§ 2-231—2-244, and enacted a new Art. VIII as set out herein. The former Art. VIII pertained to alcohol and drug use by commercial drivers and derived from Ord. No. 16-99, § 3(Exh. C), 2-18-99; Ord. No. 36-01, § 8, 9-6-01. 

                  Sec. 2-231. - General policy. 
                  Continued research and practical experience have established that even small quantities of alcohol and drugs can impair reflexes and judgment. This impairment, even when not readily apparent, can have catastrophic results, particularly for employees operating vehicles, potentially dangerous equipment, or using weapons. Unlawful drug use, including the abuse of prescription medication is also incompatible with the responsibility of City of Cartersville employees with commercial driver's license to obey the law, especially those employees who are involved in drug interdiction. To comply with the guidelines of the department of transportation in regard to operators of vehicles/equipment requiring commercial driver's licenses and other reasons, we have adopted a policy that all employees must report to work completely free from the presence of alcohol or unlawful drugs, or habit-forming drugs with whose legitimate usage constitutes a threat to safety.

                  In accordance with the U.S. Department of Transportation and the City of Cartersville Safety Sensitive regulations, the City of Cartersville is adopting the following drug and alcohol-testing program. Any questions about this policy should be directed to Otis Chupp, Fire Chief and Safety Director, 19 N. Erwin Street, Cartersville, GA 30120, (770) 387-5635, pager no. (770) 583-1905. 
                  (1)  Scope. This policy applies to all full or part-time employees of the city who operate commercial motor vehicles and who are required to have commercial drivers license and those who have safety sensitive function as defined herein; the procedures for testing all employees covered herein shall be the same as required by 49-C.F.R. § 40 for individuals that have commercial drivers licenses. 
                  (2)  Effective date. This policy becomes effective October, 2005.

                  (Ord. No. 93-05, § 1, 11-17-05) 
                  Sec. 2-234. - Prohibitions of alcohol and drug use. 
                  (a)  Alcohol use. Employees are prohibited from reporting for duty or remaining on duty requiring the performance of safety-sensitive functions while having an alcohol concentration of four hundredths (.04) or greater. Employees with an alcohol concentration of .04 or greater will be immediately removed from safety-sensitive functions. An employee whose test results indicate an alcohol concentration of two hundredths (.02) or greater, but less than four hundredths (.04), will not be allowed to perform safety-sensitive functions until the start of the employees next regularly scheduled duty period, but not less than twenty-four (24) hours following the alcohol test. 
                  Employees are prohibited from possessing or using alcohol while on duty. Employees are prohibited from performing safety-sensitive functions within four (4) hours after using alcohol. Following an accident, employees are prohibited from using alcohol for eight (8) hours or until undergoing a post-accident test. 
                  Misuse of alcohol is grounds for discharge from the city. 
                  (b)  Drug use. Employees are prohibited from reporting for duty or remaining on duty requiring the performance of safety-sensitive functions when the employee uses drugs, unless the use is due to a physician's instruction who has advised the employee that the substance does not adversely affect the employee's ability to safely operate a motor vehicle. The employee must inform the employer of any such therapeutic drug use. If tested positive for drugs, employees are prohibited from reporting for duty, remaining on duty, or performing a safety function. A positive test fro use of controlled substances is grounds for discharge from the city. 
                  (c)  Refusal of test. Refusal to submit to a drug or alcohol test has the same consequences as a positive test result. If an employee fails to provide an adequate testing sample without a valid medical explanation or engages in conduct that obstructs the testing process, that employee will be deemed to have refused to submit to testing. 
                  (Ord. No. 93-05, § 1, 11-17-05) 
                  Sec. 2-235. - Types of testing. 
                  (a)  Pre-employment testing. An employee applicant whom the city intends to hire or use shall be tested for the use of drugs, but not alcohol, as a condition of qualifications for employment. A drug test is also required whenever a current employee moves into a safety-sensitive position. No employee shall perform any safety-sensitive functions until a pre-employment test has indicated a verified negative result. 
                  (b)  Post-accident testing. When testing is required: 
                  (1)  The accident involved a fatality; or 
                  (2)  The driver receives a citation under the state or local law for a moving traffic violation arising from an accident. 
                  a.  Injury requiring medical treatment away from the scene; or 
                  b.  One (1) or more vehicles incurring disabling damage* and having to be towed from the scene. 
                  *"Disabling damage" is damage which prevents a motor vehicle from leaving the scene of the accident in its usual manner, in daylight, after simple repairs. This includes a motor vehicle that could be driven but would be damaged further if driven. 
                  It does not include: 
                  • Damage that can be remedied temporarily at the scene of the accident without special tools or parts. 
                  • Tire disablement without other damage, even if no spare tire is available. 
                  • Headlight or tail light damage. 
                  • Damage to turn signals, horn, or windshield wipers which make them inoperative. 
                  If an alcohol test is not performed within two (2) hours of the accident, the city will prepare and maintain on file a record stating why the test was not promptly administered. If an alcohol test has not been conducted within eight (8) hours of the accident, no test will be conducted and the city will maintain the same record. If a drug test has not been administered within twelve (12) hours of the accident, no test will be administered and the city will maintain on file a statement of the reasons the test was not promptly administered. 
                  If an employee subject to post-accident testing does not remain readily available for such testing, he or she will be deemed to have refused to submit to testing. However, an employee is allowed to get necessary emergency medical attention for injured people, or, if necessary, to leave the scene of an accident for the period necessary emergency medical care. The employee is responsible for ensuring that he or she complies with this section of the city's drug and alcohol testing program. 
                  (c)  Random testing. All CDL drivers and safety sensitive employees are subject to unannounced drug and alcohol testing. A random computer selection process will be used to select employees to be tested. Each employee will have an equal chance of being tested each time selections are made. At least fifty (50) percent of all employees subject to testing will be tested each year for drug use. At least ten (10) percent of all employees subject to testing will be tested each year for alcohol use. The dates of testing will be spread reasonable throughout the calendar year. When supervisors are notified of selection of employees they are to proceed to testing site immediately with the employee. Do not let employee eat or drink or le them out of eyesight. 
                  Employees will be tested for alcohol use while performing safety-sensitive functions, just before performing safety-sensitive functions, or just after performing such functions. 
                  (d)  Reasonable suspicion testing. An employee shall submit to testing whenever the city has reasonable suspicion to believe that the employee is using a prohibited drug or is using alcohol in a prohibited manner. A decision to test will be made based on specific, contemporaneous, articulable observations concerning the appearance, behavior, speech or body odors of the employee. The observations may include indications of the chronic and withdrawal effects of controlled substances. "Reasonable suspicion:" means that the city believes that the appearance, behavior, speech or body odors of the employee are indicative of the use of drugs or alcohol. A reasonable suspicion of drug or alcohol use will be made by a supervisor or, when possible two (2) supervisors. A reasonable suspicion of alcohol misuse can only be made during, or just before or after, that period of the workday when the employee is engaged in the performance of a safety-sensitive function. After observation of suspect conduct, the employee should be transported immediately to a testing site. 
                  The mere possession of alcohol does not constitute a need for reasonable suspicion testing, which must be based on observations concerning the driver's appearance, behavior, speech, or body odor. 
                  Once behavioral, speech, and performance indicators show an employee is under the influence of or impaired by alcohol, the employee must not report for, or remain on duty requiring the performance of safety-sensitive functions. An employee will only be permitted to resume performance after an alcohol test shows the employee's alcohol concentration at less than two hundredths (.02) or twenty-four (24) hours have elapsed following the determination of reasonable suspicion. If an alcohol test is not administered within two (2) hours following the supervisor's observation, a statement of the reasons for delay must be prepared and maintained on file. If an alcohol test is not administered within eight (8) hours, the employee will not be tested and a statement of the reasons for failure to administer the test will be prepared and maintained on file. 
                  Within twenty-four (24) hours of the observations being made or before the results of the drug test are released, whichever is earlier, documentation of the suspicion must be prepared and signed by the supervisor, or company official who made the observations. 
                  (e)  Return to duty testing. Any employee who has engaged in prohibited drug or alcohol use must undergo a drug or alcohol test before returning to duty requiring the performance of safety-sensitive functions. A drug test must indicate a verified negative result for drug use. An alcohol test must indicate an alcohol concentration of less than two hundredths (.02). 
                  (f)  Follow-up testing. An employee who returns to duty after a positive test is subject to follow-up testing. If a substance abuse professional determines that an employee needs help in resolving drug or alcohol abuse problems, follow-up drug and alcohol testing will be administered as directed by that substance abuse professional. At least six (6) tests are required in the first twelve (12) months from the date of the employee's return to duty. Follow-up testing will not exceed sixty (60) months from the date of the employee's return to duty. After the first six (6) tests, an employee may be released from the requirement of follow-up testing if the substance abuse professional determines that such testing is no longer necessary.

                  Sec. 2-236. - Drug testing procedures. 
                  Drug testing procedure will be in accordance with the DOT's drug testing procedures at 49 C.F.R. § 40. Employer must notify the driver that the test is required under the regulations (49 CFR Part 40) before performing a drug test. Notice can be oral or written. Use of the "Controlled Substance Custody and Control Form" may serve as the required notice. The test will be performed using any approved DOT test method. The employee will be tested for marijuana, cocaine, opiates, amphetamines and phencyclidine (PCP). Upon notification that a drug test is required, an employee must report immediately to a drug collection site. Unreasonable delay in reporting to a site after notification will be deemed a refusal to submit to testing.

                  Sec. 2-237. - Alcohol testing procedures. 
                  Alcohol testing procedures will be in accordance with the DOT's alcohol testing procedures at 49 C.F.R. § 40. The test will be performed using breath or saliva samples. Upon notification that an alcohol test is required an employee must report immediately for alcohol testing and provide a breath or saliva specimen. If an employee fails to report to a testing facility in a reasonable time, that employee will be deemed to have refused to submit to alcohol testing. If the result of the initial test is an alcohol concentration of two hundredths (.02) or greater, a confirmation test will be performed. For the purposes of this policy, alcohol means the intoxicating agent in beverage alcohol, ethyl alcohol, or other low molecular weight alcohol including methyl and isopropyl alcohol in any beverage, mixture, or preparation, including any medication.

                  Sec. 2-238. - Supervisory training. 
                  The city has established an education and training component for supervisory personnel who are authorized to determine whether reasonable suspicion exists to require an employee to undergo reasonable suspicion testing under this policy. Every such supervisor shall receive at least two (2) hours of training on the specific indicators of probable drug or alcohol abuse. One (1) hour will cover the physical, behavioral, speech, and performance indicators of probable alcohol misuse and one (1) hour on the use of controlled substances.

                  Sec. 2-239. - Record keeping. 
                  The city shall ensure that the following records are kept for a period of at least five (5) years; all records of positive drug results and alcohol test results indicating an alcohol concentration of two hundredths (.02) or greater, documentation of refusal to take tests, calibration documentation, driver evaluation and referrals, and a copy of all annual calendar year summaries of the results of the city's drug and alcohol testing programs. Records related to the alcohol and drug collection process and training will be kept for a period of at least two (2) years. Records relating to negative and cancelled drug test results and alcohol test results with a concentration of less than two hundredths (.02) will be kept for one (1) year.

                  Sec. 2-240. - Notification of test results. 
                  The city shall notify an employee of the results of any drug or alcohol test if the results of any drug or alcohol test if the results were positive. The employee will also be advised what drug was discovered. In addition, the city shall notify an employee applicant of the results of a pre-employment drug test provided that the employee applicant requests such results within six (6) days of being notified of the disposition of the employment application.

                  Sec. 2-241. - Access to facilities and records. 
                  The city will not release employee information that is contained in drug or alcohol programs records except as required by law or expressly authorized by the employee. An employee is entitled, upon written request, to obtain copies of any records pertaining to the employee's use of drugs or alcohol, including any test records. In addition, federal, state, and local officials will have access to all records and facilities used in complying with drug and alcohol program laws. The city will release an employee's records to a subsequent employer, or other person identified by an employee, upon receipt of a written request from the employee. The subsequent employer or other individual may only disclose the information expressly authorized by the employee. The city may also provide information to an employee or decision maker when a grievance or other proceeding has been initiated by or on behalf of the employee which arises from the results of a drug or alcohol test given by the city or from the city's determination that the employee engaged in prohibited conduct. Such proceeding may pertain, for example, to worker's compensation, or other claims or benefits sought by the employee.

                  Sec. 2-242. - Release of test information by previous employers. 
                  Within fourteen (14) days of the first time an employee performs a safety sensitive function for the city, the city is required by law to obtain information from an employee's previous employer on the employee's positive drug test results, alcohol test results of four hundredths (.04) or greater and refusals to be tested for drugs or alcohol within the preceding two (2) years. This information must be obtained with the consent of the employee. Other information relating to an employee's drug and alcohol use may be obtained, pursuant to the employee's consent, by the city. Any such request must be accompanied by the employee's written authorization for release of the information. Refusal to consent to release of this information by the employee has the same consequences as a positive test result.

                  Sec. 2-243. - Referral, evaluation, and treatment. 
                  Any employee, except for any employee applicant who tests positive for drug use or alcohol misuse will be advised of the resources available to the employee in evaluating and resolving problems associated with the misuse of alcohol and use of drugs including the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of substance abuse professionals and counseling and treatment programs. The city will bear the cost of providing this referral information. 
                  In order for an employee who has tested positive for drug use or alcohol misuse to return to a position requiring the performance of a safety sensitive function, that employee must be evaluated by a substance abuse professional who will determine what assistance, if any, the employee needs in resolving problems associated with alcohol misuse and drug use. Any employee identified as needing assistance in resolving such problems must successfully complete any rehabilitation program that is prescribed by a substance abuse professional before performing a safety sensitive function. Follow up testing will be conducted under the supervision of the substance abuse professional. Evaluation, assistance, rehabilitation, and follow up testing will be obtained, if at all, at the cost of the employee.

                  Upon report of a positive test, the employee or applicant will be notified of the test results. As part of that notification, he or she will be provided an opportunity to explain any positive results. An employee or applicant whose test results were positive may, at the employee's or applicant's own expense, have a re-test within ten (10) days of being notified of the original test results. The laboratory used for the re-test shall have chain of custody procedures to ensure proper exchange with the return of the samples to the original medical group or laboratory. Following review or the appeal process, a final determination will be made by the appropriate authority. Employees who have disciplinary action taken against them as a result of a positive drug test may file a grievance or appeal to the city manager for a hearing.

                  Subpart L—Alcohol screening tests. 
                  § 40.241 What are the first steps in any alcohol screening test? 
                  As the BAT or STT you will take the following steps to begin all alcohol screening tests, regardless of the type of testing device you are using: 
                  a)  When a specific time for an employee's test has been scheduled, or the collection site is at the employee's worksite, and the employee does not appear at the collection site at the scheduled time, contact the DER to determine the appropriate interval within which the DER has determined the employee is authorized to arrive. If the employee's arrival is delayed beyond that time, you must notify the DER that the employee has not reported for testing. In a situation where a C/TPA has notified an owner/operator or other individual employee to report for testing and the employee does not appear, the C/TPA must notify the employee that he or she has refused to test. 
                  b)  Ensure that, when the employee enters the alcohol testing site, you begin alcohol testing process without undue delay. For example, you must not wait because the employee says he or she is not ready or because an authorized employer or employee representative is delayed in arriving. 
                  1.  If the employee is also going to take a DOT drug test, you must, to the greatest extent practicable, ensure that the alcohol test is completed before the urine collection process begins. 
                  2.  If the employee needs medical attention (e.g., an injured employee in an emergency medical facility who is required to have a post-accident test), do not delay this treatment to conduct a test. 
                  c)  Require the employee to provide positive identification. You must see a photo ID issued by the employer (other than in the case of an owner-operator or other self-employer individual) or a Federal, State, or local government (e.g., a driver's license). You may not accept faxes or photocopies of identification. Positive identification by an employer representative (not a co-worker or another employee being tested) is also acceptable. If the employee cannot produce positive identification, you must contact DER to verify the identity of the employee. 
                  d)  If the employee asks, provide your identification to the employee. Your identification must include your name and your employer's name but is not required to include your picture, address, or telephone number. 
                  e)  Explain the testing procedure to the employee, including showing the employee the instructions on the back of the ATF. 
                  f)  Complete Step 1 of the ATF. 
                  g)  Direct the employee to complete Step 2 on the ATF and sign the certification. If the employee refuses to sign this certification, you must document this refusal on the "Remarks" line of the ATF and immediately notify the DER. This is a refusal to test. 
                  Subpart L—Alcohol screening tests. 
                  § 40.25 What is the procedure for an alcohol screening test using a saliva ASD or a breath tube ASD? 
                  a)  As the STT or BAT, you must take the following steps when using the saliva ASD: 
                  1.  Check the expiration date on the device or package containing the device and show it to the employee. You may not use the device after the expiration date. 
                  2.  Open the individually wrapped or sealed package containing the device in the presence of the employee. 
                  3.  Offer the employee the opportunity to use the device. If the employee uses it, you must instruct the employee to insert it into his or her mouth and use it in a manner described by the device's manufacturer. 
                  4.  If the employee chooses not to use the device, or in all cases which a new test is necessary because the device did not activate (see paragraph (a)(7) of this section), you must insert the device into the employee's mouth and gather saliva in the manner described by the device's manufacturer. You must wear single-use examination or similar gloves while doing so and change them following each test. 
                  5.  When the device is removed from the employee's mouth, you must follow the manufacturer's instructions regarding necessary next steps in ensuring that the device has activated. 
                  6.  (i)  If you were unable to successfully follow the procedures of paragraphs (a)(3) through (a)(5) of this section (e.g., the device breaks, you drop the device on the floor), you must discard the device and conduct a new test using a new device. 
                  (ii)  The new device you use must be one that has been under your control or that of the employee before the test. 
                  (iii)  You must note on the "Remarks" line of the ATF the reason for the new test. (Note: You may continue using the same ATF with which you began the test.) 
                  (iv)  You must offer the employee the choice of using the device or having you use it unless the employee, in the opinion of the STT or BAT, was responsible (e.g., the employee dropped the device) for the new test needing to be conducted. 
                  (v)  If you are unable to successfully follow the procedures of paragraphs (a)(3) through (a)(5) of this section on the new test, you must end the collection and put an explanation on the "Remarks" line of the ATF. 
                  (vi)  You must then direct the employee to take a new test immediately, using an EBT for the screening test. 
                  7.  If you are unable to successfully follow the procedures of paragraphs (a)(3)—(a)(5) of this section, but the device does not activate, you must discard the device and conduct a new test, in the same manner as provided in paragraph (a)(6) of this section. In this case, you must place the device into the employee's mouth to collect saliva for the new test. 
                  8.  You must read the result displayed on the device no sooner than the device's manufacturer instructs. In all cases the result displayed must be read within fifteen (15) minutes of the test. You must then show the device and it's reading to the employee and enter the result on the ATF. 
                  9.  You must never re-use devices, swabs, gloves or other materials used in saliva testing. 
                  10.  You must note the fact that you used a saliva ASD in Step 3 of the ATF. 
                  (b)  As the STT or BAT, you must take the following steps when using the breath tube ASD: 
                  1.  Check the expiration date on the device or on the package containing the device and show it to the employee. You must not use the device after its expiration date. 
                  2.  Remove a device from the package and break the tube's ampule in the presence of the employee. 
                  3.  Secure an inflation bag onto the appropriate end of the device, as directed by the manufacturer on the device's instructions. 
                  4.  Offer the employee the opportunity to use the device. If the employee chooses to use (e.g., hold) the device, instruct the employee to blow forcefully and steadily into the blowing end of device until the inflation bag fills with air (approximately twelve (12) seconds). 
                  5.  If the employee chooses not to hold the device, you must hold it and provide the use instructions in paragraph (b)(4) of this section. 
                  6.  When the employee completes the breath process, take the device from the employee (or if you were holding it, remove it from the employee's mouth); remove the inflation bag; and either hold the device or place it on a clean flat surface while waiting for the reading to appear. 
                  7.  (i)  If you were unable to successfully follow the procedures of paragraphs (b)(4) through (b)(6) of this section (e.g., the device breaks apart, the employee did not fill the inflation bag), you must discard the device and conduct a new test using a new one. 
                  (ii)  The new device you use must be one that has been under your control or that of the employer before the test. 
                  (iii)  You must note on the "Remarks" line of the ATF the reason for the new test. (Note: You may continue using the same ATF with which you began the test.) 
                  (iv)  You must offer the employee the choice of holding the device or having you hold it unless the employee, in your opinion, was responsible (e.g., the employee failed to fill the inflation bag) for the new test needing to be conducted. 
                  (v)  If you are unable to successfully follow the procedures of paragraphs (b)(4) through (b)(6) of this section on the new test, you must end collection and put an explanation on the "Remarks" line of the ATF. 
                  (vi)  You must then direct the employee to take a new test immediately, using another type of ASD (e.g., saliva device) or an EBT. 
                  8.  If you were able to successfully follow the procedures of paragraphs (b)(4) through (b)(6) of this section, you must compare the color of the crystals in the device with the colored crystals on the manufacturer-produced control tube no sooner than the manufacturer instructs. In all cases color comparisons must take place within fifteen (15) minutes of the test. 
                  9.  You must follow the manufacturer's instructions for determining the result of the test. You must then show both the device and the control tube side-by-side to the employee and record the result on the ATF. 
                  10.  You must never re-use devices or gloves used in breath tube testing. The inflation bag must be voided of air following removal from a device. One (1) inflation bag can be used for up to ten (10) breath tube tests. 
                  11.  You must note the fact that you used a breath tube device in Step 3 of the ATF. {67 FR 61522, Oct. 1, 2002}

If the owner cannot be located or the owner fails to take immediate steps to remove the animal from impoundment, the infected animal shall be humanely destroyed in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 4-11-5.1. 
                  (d)  Reimbursement. The owner of the animal shall be responsible for reimbursement to animal control, the city and/or county animal shelter for all expenses involving the boarding, treatment and destruction of any such animal.

If the animal survives and does not show signs of rabies, it will be returned to the owner upon payment of fees. 
                  (h)  Quarantine/isolation procedures. In certain circumstances, the animal control officer may allow the animal owner to quarantine the animal that has been bitten in lieu of the animal being euthanized and tested. The quarantine period varies depending on the circumstance, as set forth in the Georgia Rabies Control Manual, latest edition. In that case, the animal must be placed in a secure enclosure where no other animal or person can be exposed to the virus which can be transmitted into bite wounds, open cuts in skin and onto mucous membranes. The animal must be kept in a secure enclosure approved by the animal control department and when deemed necessary may require two (2) layers of fencing, separated by at least one (1) foot.

                  Sec. 5-22. - Dog classification. 
                  (a)  Classification levels. "Classified dog" means any dog that has been classified as either a dangerous or vicious dog pursuant to this article. Classifications are as follows: 
                  (1)  Dangerous dog. Any dog that: 
                  a.  Causes a substantial puncture of a person's skin by teeth without causing serious injury (see section 5-3); provided, however, that a nip, scratch or abrasion shall not be sufficient to classify a dog as dangerous under this subsection; 
                  b.  Aggressively attacks in a manner that causes a person to reasonably believe that the dog posed an imminent threat of serious injury (see section 5-3) to such a person or another person although no such injury occurs; provided, however, that the acts of barking, growling, or showing of teeth by a dog shall not be sufficient to classify a dog as dangerous under this subsection; or 
                  c.  While off the owner's property, kills a pet animal; provided, however, that this subsection shall not apply where the death of such pet animal is caused by a dog that is working or training as a hunting dog, herding dog, or predator control dog. 
                  (2)  Vicious dog. Any dog that inflicts a severe injury on a person or causes serious injury (see section 5-3) to a person resulting from reasonable attempts to escape the dog's attack. 
                  (3)  Euthanasia for causing serious injury on more than one (1) occasion. Pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 4-8-26, a dog that is found, after notice and opportunity for hearing as provided, however, that no injury occurring before _______________, shall count for purposes of this subsection. 
                  (4)  Judge authorized to order euthanasia. Pursuant O.C.G.A. § 4-8-25, the judge of any superior court of competent jurisdiction within this state may order the euthanasia of a dog if the court finds, after notice and opportunity for hearing as provided by this section, that the dog has seriously injured a human or presents a danger to humans not suitable for control under this article and: 
                  a.  The owner or custodian of the dog has been convicted of a violation of any state criminal law and the crime was related to such dog; or 
                  b.  Any local governmental authority has filed with the court a civil action requesting the euthanasia of the dog. 
                  (5)  Previously classified animals. Any dog classified prior to ____________, as a potentially dangerous dog in this state shall on and after that date be classified as a dangerous dog. Any dog classified prior to ___________ as a dangerous dog or vicious dog in this state shall on and after that date be classified as a vicious dog under this chapter. The owner of any dog classified prior to ____________ shall come into compliance with all current provisions of this chapter by _____________. 
                  (b)  Confiscation. If an animal control officer has reason to believe that a dog has acted in a manner that justifies a classification as a dangerous dog or a vicious dog, the dog may be confiscated, impounded, classified, and notice provided as set forth below. A law enforcement officer or animal control officer shall immediately impound a dog if the officer believes the dog poses a threat to the public safety. 
                  (c)  Exceptions. An animal shall not be classified within the meaning of this section if it inflicts injury upon a person when the animal is being used by a law enforcement officer or military officer to carry out the law enforcement or military officer's official duties. No dog shall be classified as a dangerous or vicious dog if the person injured by such dog was a person who, at the time was: (1) committing a trespass; (2) was abusing the dog; or (3) was committing or attempting to commit an offense under O.C.G.A. tit. 16, ch. 5. 
                  (d)  Classification by animal control. The animal control officer shall make a determination whether the dog shall be classified a dangerous dog or vicious dog. The owner shall be given notice of the classification pursuant to subsection (e) below. If an owner is unknown or cannot be found, notice shall be made by posting the notice in a conspicuous place at the location where the animal was confiscated.

                  (3)  The notice shall be dated and shall state that the owner, within fifteen (15) days after the date shown on the notice, has a right to request an appeal hearing on the animal control officer's classification of the dog; 
                  (4)  The notice shall state that the hearing, if requested, shall be before the City of Cartersville Animal Control Board; 
                  (5)  The notice shall state that if a hearing is not requested, the classification of the dog as a dangerous dog or vicious dog will become effective for all purposes under this chapter on a date specified in the notice, which shall be after the last day on which the owner has a right to request a hearing; and 
                  (6)  The notice shall include a form to request a hearing and shall provide specific instructions on mailing or delivering such request to animal control. 
                  (f)  Response to notice.

If the owner comes forward and no appeal hearing is requested, the animal may be returned to the owner provided the owner complies with the requirements of this chapter, including payment of fees set forth in subsection (j) and the requirements of section 5-3. If a hearing is requested, the provisions of subsection (g) shall apply. 
                  (g)  Appeal hearing. When the animal control board receives a proper and timely request for an appeal hearing of a classification, it shall schedule such hearing within thirty (30) days after receiving the request; however, such hearing may be continued by the authority for good cause shown. The board shall notify the dog owner in writing by certified mail or statutory overnight delivery of the date, time, and place of the hearing, and such notice shall be mailed to the dog owner at least ten (10) days prior to the date of the hearing; and such notice shall be mailed to the dog owner at least ten (10) days prior to the date of the hearing. At the hearing, the owner of the dog shall be given the opportunity to testify and present evidence and in addition, thereto the governing authority or board shall receive such other evidence and hear such other testimony as the governing authority or board may find reasonably necessary to make a determination either to sustain, modify, or overrule the animal control officer's classification of the dog, including the power to impose conditions on continued possession of the dog. 
                  (h)  Decision. After hearing the evidence the animal control board shall be empowered to take the following actions:

                  (i)  Notice of decision. The decision shall be made at the hearing, and within ten (10) days after the date of the hearing, the animal control board shall notify the dog owner in writing by certified mail or statutory overnight delivery of its determination on the matter. If such determination is that the dog is a dangerous dog or vicious dog, the notice shall specify the date upon which that determination is effective. Any specific additional conditions or restrictions shall be set forth in the notice. If the determination is that the dog is to be euthanized pursuant to subsection 5-22(a)(3), the notice shall specify the date by which the euthanasia shall occur. 
                  (j)  Return to owner.

Judicial review of the animal control officer's final decision may be had in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 50-13-19, except that venue shall be limited to the Bartow County Superior Court.

In addition, if the owner is unknown, notice shall be published once in a newspaper of general circulation in the city. 
                  (3)  Appeal hearing. If an animal is impounded pursuant to sections 5-16 or 5-18, and the owner thereof refuses to enter into a consent agreement with the animal shelter that such animal will be given humane care and adequate and necessary veterinary care, the owner may request, in writing, a hearing within five (5) business days of the date the notice of impoundment was served on such owner, or, if the owner is unknown or could not be found, within thirty (30) days of the date of publication of the notice of impoundment in a newspaper of general circulation in the city.

Owners shall have no more than five (5) days from the date of notice to cure or correct the violation, or the dogs shall be deemed unclaimed; this time limit may be extended by animal control, to no more than twenty (20) days. Return to the owner upon payment of fees shall not be an option for animals that are a threat to public safety or health, require quarantine, or where impounded for cruelty, inhumane treatment, dog fighting, other illegal action, vicious attacks, or other circumstances requiring a hearing under this chapter. 
                  (4)  Appeal hearing. The animal owner may request, in writing, a hearing within five (5) business days of the date the notice of impoundment was served on such owner or being posted in the case of abandoned dogs. Hearings shall be in accordance with section 5-34. Such request for hearing shall be served upon the animal control officer. If no hearing is requested within the time limits herein specified and the failure to request such hearing is due in whole or in part to the reasonably avoidable fault of the owner, the right to a hearing shall have been waived. 
                  (5)  Consent agreement. Prior to release of an animal impounded under these provisions, the owner must enter into a consent agreement providing that, among other things, the animal will be given humane care and veterinary treatment, the animal will not be subject to mistreatment or illegal activity; and the owner will comply with all terms of this chapter. Animal control may specify additional terms as required. 
                  (c)  Criminal matters; bond. The provisions of subsections (a)(4) or (b)(5) of this section shall not apply to an animal that was an object or instrumentality of a crime nor shall any such animal be returned to the owner without the approval of the prosecuting attorney and animal control. If dogs are impounded for violation of O.C.G.A. § 16-12-4 (cruelty to animals) or O.C.G.A. § 16-12-37 (dog fighting), they shall not be returned to the owner until the case is completed, or unless otherwise ordered by the court. In such cases, the owner shall be required to post a surety bond for the costs of impoundment of the dog for the duration of the proceeding, in the amount of two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) per animal impounded, or shall release the animals to animal control for disposal. The surety bond shall be issued by a surety company authorized to transact business in this state, or the bond may be paid in cash. If bond is not posted within thirty (30) days of impoundment, animal control shall apply to the court for permission to dispose of the animal prior to trial of the criminal case as provided by law. 
                  (d)  Owners liable for fees. In the event an animal is not claimed from impoundment and is therefore destroyed or the animal otherwise dies, and the owner is known, the owner shall still be responsible for the impoundment charges, including boarding fees and veterinary care costs, for the period the animal was held.

If the animal is impounded under contract with a third party, the animal shelter shall pay for such costs of boarding and treatment; 
                  (3)  If the board finds that the animal was lawfully impounded, the board may: (a) recommend the shelter dispose of the animal in accordance with this section; or (b) unless, in a prior administrative or legal action, the owner has been found to have failed to provide humane care to an animal, committed cruelty to animals, or engaged in dog fighting in violation of the laws of this state or of the United States or any of the several states, recommend conditions under which the animal may, upon payment by the owner of all costs of impoundment and care, be returned to the owner. Such conditions shall be reduced to writing and served upon the owner and the animal shelter.

The owner shall be cited for violation of this chapter. 
                  (b)  Return of animals with violations. If an animal is impounded for a violation, and the procedure for return is not otherwise specified in this chapter, or a hearing is not otherwise requested or required, the animal shall be returned once all fees for the violation and impoundment are paid, and the conditions necessitating the impoundment have been cured or corrected, if applicable.

                  (d)  Owners liable for fees.

                  (3)  Special foundation permit. When application for permit to erect or enlarge a building has been filed and pending issuance of such permit, the building official may, at his discretion, issue a special permit for the foundation only. The holder of such a special permit is proceeding at his own risk and without assurance that a permit for the remainder of the work will be granted nor that corrections will not be required in order to meet provisions of the construction codes. 
                  (4)  Public right-of-way. A permit shall not be given by the building official for the construction of any building, or for the alteration of any building where said building is to be changed and such change will affect the exterior walls, bays, balconies, or other appendages or projections fronting on any street, alley or public lane, or for the placing on any lot or premises of any building or structure removed from another lot or premises, unless the applicant has made application at the office of the director of public works for the lines of the public street on which he/she proposes to build, erect or locate said building; and it shall be the duty of the building official to see that the street lines are not encroached upon except as provided for in Chapter 22 of the Standard Building Code.

                  (f)  Conditions of the permit. 
                  (1)  Permit intent. A permit issued shall be construed to be a license to proceed with the work and not as authority to violate, cancel, alter, or set aside any of the provisions of the construction codes, nor shall issuance of a permit prevent the building official from thereafter requiring a correction of errors in plans, construction, or violations of the construction codes. Every permit issued shall become invalid unless the work authorized by such permit is commenced within six (6) months after its issuance, or if the work authorized by such permit is suspended or abandoned for a period of six (6) months after the time the worked is commenced. One (1) or more extensions of time, for periods not more than ninety (90) days each, may be allowed for the permit. The extension shall be requested in writing and justifiable cause demonstrated.

In addition, they shall be responsible for conformity with the permit, provide copies of inspection reports as inspections are performed, and upon completion make and file with the building official written affidavit that the work has been done in conformity with the reviewed plans and with the structural provisions of the Construction codes. In the event such architect or engineer is not available, the owner shall employ in his stead a competent person or agency whose qualifications are reviewed by the building official. 
                  (3)  Plans. When the building official issues a permit, he/she shall enforce, in writing or by stamp, both sets of plans "Reviewed for Code Compliance." One (1) set of drawings so reviewed shall be retained by the building official and the other set shall be returned to the applicant. The permitted drawings shall be kept at the site of work and shall be open to inspection by the building official or his/her authorized representative.

                  (1)  If the repair, alteration or improvement of the said dwelling, building or structure can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter, or improve such dwelling, building, or structure so as to bring it into full compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violation; and, if applicable, to secure by closing the structure so that it cannot be used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or 
                  (2)  If the repair, alteration or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure in order to bring it into full compliance with applicable codes relevant to the cited violations cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to demolish and remove such dwelling, building or structure and all debris from the property. 
                  For purposes of this section, the court shall make its determination of reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure without consideration of the value of the land on which the structure is situated; provided, however, that costs of the preparation necessary to repair, alter, or improve a structure may be considered; and, provided further, that if the unsatisfactory condition is limited solely to the presence of graffiti, the dwelling, building or structure shall not be ordered demolished or closed, but its owner may be ordered to repair the same by cleaning or removal of the graffiti. Income and financial status of the owner shall not be a factor in the court's determination. The present value of the structure and the costs of repair, alteration or improvement may be established by affidavits of real estate appraisers with a Georgia appraiser classification as provided in O.C.G.A. tit. 43, ch. 39A, qualified building contractors, or qualified building inspectors without actual testimony presented. Costs of repair, alteration or improvement of the structure shall be the cost necessary to bring the structure into compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violations in force in the jurisdiction. 
                  (d)  If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair or demolish the dwelling, building or structure, the public officer shall cause such dwelling, building or structure to be repaired, altered or improved, or to be vacated and closed, or demolished within two hundred seventy (270) days of the expiration of time specified in the order for abatement by the owner. Any time during which such action is prohibited by a court order issued pursuant to subsection (c) of this section or any equitable relief granted by a court of competent jurisdiction shall not be counted toward the two hundred seventy (270) days in which such abatement action shall commence. The public officer shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of the building, dwelling or structure a placard with the following words: 
                  "This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial or business use and does not comply with the applicable codes or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with drug crimes or constitutes an endangerment to public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful." 
                  (e)  If the public officer has the structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any moneys received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. The public officer and governing authority are relieved of any and all liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials. 
                  (f)  The amount of the cost of demolition, including all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the tax commissioner, and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, including restoration to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred. 
                  (g)  The lien provided for in subsection (e) shall attach to the real property upon the filing of a certified copy of the order requiring repair, closure, or demolition in the office of the Clerk of Superior Court in Bartow County and shall relate back to the date of the filing of the lis pendens notice required under subsection (a). The clerk of superior court shall record and index such certified copy of the order in the deed records of the county and enter the lien on the general execution docket. The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except liens for taxes to which the lien shall be inferior, and shall continue in force until paid. After filing a certified copy of the order with the clerk of superior court, the public officer shall, within ninety (90) days of the completion of repairs, demolition or closure, forward a copy of the order and a final statement of costs to the county tax commissioner. 
                  (h)  It shall be the duty of the county tax commissioner to collect the amount of the lien in conjunction with the collection of ad valorem taxes on the property and to collect the amount of the lien as if it were a real property ad valorem tax, using all methods available for collecting real property ad valorem taxes, including specifically O.C.G.A. § 48-4-5; provided, however, that the limitation of O.C.G.A § 48-4-78 which requires twelve (12) months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure shall not apply; provided, further, that redemption of property from the lien may be made in accordance with the provisions of O.C.G.A. §§ 48-4-80 and 48-4-81. The tax commissioner may initiate enforcement of liens imposed under this section at any time following receipt of the final determination of costs from the public officer. The unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties from and after the date of final determination of costs in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes. 
                  (i)  The tax commissioner shall remit the amount collected to the governing authority of the municipality whose ordinance is being enforced. The tax commissioner may retain an amount equal to the cost of administering collection of the lien. Any such amount collected and retained for administration shall be deposited in the general fund of the county to pay the cost of administering the lien. 
                  (j)  The governing authority may waive and release any such lien imposed on property upon the owner of such property entering into a contract with the municipality agreeing to a timetable for rehabilitation of the real property or the dwelling, building, or structure on the property and demonstrating the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation. 
                  (k)  Review of a court order requiring the repair, alteration, improvement or demolition of a dwelling, building or structure shall be by direct appeal to the superior court under O.C.G.A. § 5-3-29.

To the extent any federal or state law, regulation, or ordinance requires compliance as a condition precedent to the issuance of a permit, plan or design approval, inspection or other activity by the city, its officers, employees and agents, issuance of such permit, approval, or inspection shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver or estoppel of the condition precedent, and it shall remain the obligation and responsibility of the owner, his design professional(s), and contractor(s) to satisfy such legal requirements.

                  (a)  The existence of real property which is maintained in a blighted condition increases the burden of the state and local government by increasing the need for government services, including but not limited to, social services, public safety services, and code enforcement services.

                  (b)  In furtherance of its objective to eradicate conditions of slum and blight within the city, the mayor and city council, in exercise of the powers granted to municipal corporations at O.C.G.A. tit. 36, ch. 61, Urban Redevelopment, has designated those areas of the city where conditions of slum and blight are found or are likely to spread. 
                  (c)  In recognition of the need for enhanced governmental services and in order to encourage private property owners to maintain their real property and the buildings, structures and improvement thereon in good condition and repair, and as an incentive to encourage community redevelopment, a community redevelopment tax incentive program is hereby established as authorized by Article IX, Section II, Paragraph VII(d) of the 1983 Constitution of the State of Georgia.

                  (2)  A written inspection report of the findings for any parcel of property inspected pursuant to subsection (a)(1) above, shall be prepared and submitted to the public officer. Where feasible, photographs of the conditions found to exist on the property on the date of inspection shall be made and supplement the inspection report.

                  (3)  Following completion of the inspection report, the public officer shall make a determination, in writing, that a property is maintained in a blighted condition, as defined by this article, and is subject to increased taxation.

The decreased rate of taxation may be given in successive years, depending on the amount of cost expended by the person(s) chargeable with payment of ad valorem taxes on the property to satisfy its remediation or redevelopment, with every twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00) or portion thereof equaling one (1) year of tax reduction; provided, however, that no property shall be entitled to reduction in city ad valorem taxes for more than four (4) successive years.

                  a.  The purpose of the maintenance bonds, irrevocable standby letter of credit, or escrow deposit is as follows: 
                  1.  To protect the property of the cemetery and lot holders. 
                  2.  To insure proper internment procedures are followed. 
                  3.  To insure that no damage to the cemetery, tombstones, grave sites, family plots, or related appurtenances occurs due to the internment. 
                  4.  To provide a guaranty for the warranty and maintenance period for the above items 
                  b.  The maintenance bonds, irrevocable standby letter of credit, and/or escrow deposit shall only be issued in a form approved by the city. The language and term must be approved by the city prior to issuance. The city shall provide forms that it prefers the issuer of the surety to use, however if the surety has its own form, said form shall be approved by the city engineer and attorney prior to the acceptance of the surety. Any irrevocable standby letter of credit or maintenance bond shall be issued by a company or financial institution authorized to transact business in the State of Georgia. Irrevocable standby letters of credit shall be issued in accordance with the current International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) publications governing said letters of credits and must be issued by a bank having a physical branch located in the city, which shall be the place of tender on the draft of said letter of credit. The city reserves the right to reject a surety from a financial institution or insurance company that has proved an unsatisfactory or unresponsive surety in the past. Escrow Deposits shall be good funds deposited in a bank of the city's choosing, pursuant to the escrow instructions issued by the city. The city further reserves the right to demand a specific form of surety in the event that a developer, financial institution, or insurer has provided an unsatisfactory surety in the past or due to the specific requirements or obligations to be contained in the surety. 
                  c.  In each case the surety guarantees compliance with all applicable provisions of the City of Cartersville Code of Ordinances including, but not limited to, the Development Regulations of the City of Cartersville. 
                  d.  If repairs are needed prior to or at the end of the thirty-day maintenance period, the permittee shall be required to make such repairs within ten (10) days or other time period as determined by the superintendent, after written notification by the city. In the opinion of the superintendent if an emergency situation that threatens public safety exists, and the permittee can not complete the repairs in the appropriate time frame, the city may call the surety immediately and complete the project or repairs itself. If the repairs are not completed within said time, and the permittee fails to show a legitimate hardship, as determined by the city, which inhibits the completion of the repairs, the maintenance bond, escrow deposit or irrevocable standby letter of credit shall be called in to pay for the repairs. Should the amount of the maintenance bond or letter of credit be inadequate to pay for the repairs, the permittee shall pay the remaining amount. The following procedures shall apply in this situation: 
                  1.  The city shall notify the permittee in writing of such action. 
                  2.  Upon completion of necessary maintenance repairs, the permittee shall request in writing to the city for inspection of the maintenance repairs. The city shall make said inspection and in turn notify the permittee of the inspection results. 
                  e.  If the work is free from defects, and the improvements are in compliance with city specifications, the city shall provide written approval to the permittee of said compliance and the maintenance bond, escrow deposit, or letter of credit shall be released. 
                  f.  If the surety is ever called to make repairs, the superintendent has the right to deny future internment permits.

Site plans for lift stations shall show existing and proposed contours. In the event the subdivision is developed in phases, the final construction plans for sewers may be submitted in phases or units. However, at the time the first phase is submitted, the engineer will submit one (1) copy of the preliminary layout of the entire sewer system. This layout will show all lines required to serve any lots to be developed and any surrounding property that may be served through the property. The site plans for each phase or unit shall contain a location drawing showing the relationship of the phase or unit to the total project and to the surrounding streets and sewers. 
                  (c)  Profiles should have a horizontal scale of not more than one hundred (100) feet to the inch for cross-country lines and fifty (50) feet to the inch for congested areas, and a vertical scale of not more than twenty (20) feet to the inch. The plan view should be drawn to a corresponding horizontal scale. The plan view should normally be shown on the same sheet as the profile. In any case both the plan and profile view should have line designations, station numbers, manhole numbers and any other indexing necessary to easily correlate the plan and profile view. Plans and profiles shall show: 
                  1.  Location of streets, sewers and utility easements.

                  (b)  Erosion control details. Erosion control details and symbols may be taken directly from the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia, 1992, referenced above. 
                  (6)  As-built drawings. At the completion of construction (and preferably prior to the final field inspection), "as-built" drawings of the project shall be submitted to the city to serve as a permanent record of the project and shall be furnished in the form of one (1) set of mylar sepias (or other suitable form of reproducible drawings) and two (2) sets of blue line copies. Acceptance by the city will be made only after satisfactory as-built drawings have been submitted. As-built drawings will be in the same format as the original construction plans and normally will be an updated version of the construction plans. As-built drawing shall be prepared by the project design professional. Each sheet of these drawings shall bear the words "as-built" or "record drawings." Guidelines for preparation of as-builts: 
                  1.  As-built drawings will be in the same format as the original construction plans. 
                  2.  Contour lines are required. 
                  3.  Road names and lot numbers should be on plan. 
                  4.  "As-built" or "record drawing" is to be stamped in large clear print on plans. 
                  5.  Sheet should be no larger than twenty-four (24) inches × thirty-six (36) inches. 
                  6.  Lateral locations must show distance from the downstream manhole. Ends of lateral lines must show distance from downstream manhole and offset distance from the main line. Approximate depth of end of lateral must be indicated.

                  10.  Show actual slope of pipe. 
                  11.  When a phase of a subdivision is completed, a location sketch of entire subdivision with said phase outlined shall appear on plans. 
                  12.  Maximum error of as-built measurements shall be: 
                  a.  Manhole inverts: measure to one-tenth (0.10) feet with maximum vertical error of one-fifteenth (0.15) feet per one thousand (1,000) feet of horizontal traverse. 
                  b.  Manhole tops: measure to one-tenth (0.10) feet with maximum vertical error of one-half (0.50) feet per one thousand (1,000) feet of horizontal traverse. 
                  c.  Horizontal locations: Measure to nearest one (1.0) foot with allowable error of one (1.0) foot per one thousand (1,000) feet of traverse. 
                  (7)  Easement acquisition and utility encroachment permits. 
                  (a)  It shall be the responsibility of the developer to obtain any off-site easements required to connect the project to existing public sewers. Easements will be conveyed to the city for all facilities which are to be conveyed to the city. This process must be started early enough to allow construction of the sewer before any building construction is to begin. No building permits or sewer tap applications can be issued until off-site sewers have been constructed and accepted. This condition shall override any provision for speed up of house starts such as furnishing a bond to guarantee completion of the streets and other appurtenances. 
                  (b)  All easements shall allow adequate room to construct the sewer and appurtenances. Permanent easements shall be a minimum of twenty (20) feet wide, ten (10) feet on each side of the line; except that when the depth of the sewer exceeds ten (10) feet the required sewer easement width shall increase such that the easement width is at least twice the depth from the ground surface to bottom of the pipe. Designs involving utilities sharing a common easement will be coordinated with the utilities to insure adequate separation of utilities and overall easement width is achieved. 
                  (c)  Easement drawings for work outside the development shall be furnished and recorded prior to approval of the sewer plans. The drawings shall be of a size suitable for legal recording and shall be prepared by a state registered land surveyor. The drawing will show property lines, the name of property owners with the length of line encroaching on each property owner, size of line, line designation, manhole numbers and stations, width of permanent and construction easement, scale of drawing, north arrow, land lot and district numbers, and a tie to the nearest land lot corner. Any streets or other existing easements shall also be shown. The title block shall be shown as follows:

                  John Doe 
                  LL: District: Section: Date: Revised Date: 
                  (d)  The engineer shall furnish appropriate drawings for submittal to the appropriate permitting agency of any state or federal highways, railroads, power lines, water lines, gas lines, petroleum lines, or any other utility lines on which the sewer construction will encroach. The drawing shall be eight and one-half (8½) inches × eleven (11) inches and shall show a plan view and profile view. The drawing will show the same information required for easement drawings. Also, the drawing will show the right-of-way of the existing street or utility, the owner's designation of the line, the name or number of the nearest intersection or mile post or tower number and the distance to that appurtenance. The clearance distance between the street surface, or the bottom of the rail, or the utility and the sewer will be shown. The drawing will show the type of material to be used for the sewer and the method of construction to be used. The drawing will also contain any other special information required by the controlling authority of the facility on which the sewer is encroaching. A minimum of five (5) copies of the utility encroachment drawing will be furnished with the plans when they are submitted for approval. The engineer is also responsible for furnishing a completed encroachment permit application ready for signature by department superintendent. Construction permits will not be issued until the utility encroachment permit has been obtained and until any special conditions such as insurance requirements have been complied with. 
                  (Ord. No. 32-98, § 1, 8-27-98) 
                  Sec. 7.5-93. - Design criteria and materials for sewers. 
                  (1)  Generally. The criteria listed herein is not intended to cover all aspects of design, but rather to mention the basic guidelines and those particulars that are required by the city water department. For more detailed criteria, the reader should refer to standard references such as "Ten States Standards," Georgia EPD rules, Water Pollution Environment Federation Manual of Practice No. FD-5, and other available literature. 
                  (2)  Types of sewers. All sewers for the conveyance of wastewater shall be designed as separate sanitary sewers in which groundwater, stormwater or other runoff from roofs, streets, parking lots, foundation drains and any source other than wastewater are excluded. Overflows from sewers shall not be permitted. 
                  (3)  Design period. Gravity sewer pipelines should, as a minimum, be designed with capacity sufficient to handle the estimated tributary population. Tributary population is considered to be all areas upstream of the discharge point of the system being designed as well as any anticipated pumped flow from other basins. Sewers will be designed and installed along the entire road frontage of the property where gravity service is feasible and to the uppermost property line of the development being served. 
                  (4)  Capacity and size determinations. In determining the required capacities of sanitary sewers, the following factors should be considered: 
                  (1)  Maximum hourly sewage flow. 
                  (2)  Additional maximum sewage or waste flow from industrial plants. 
                  (3)  Ground water infiltration. 
                  (4)  Topography of the area. 
                  (5)  Depth of excavation. 
                  New sewer systems shall be designed on the basis of an average daily flow of sewage of not less than four hundred (400) gallons per household per day. Normally, all sewers shall be designed for a peak flow of not less than two and one-half (2½) times the average flow; this peak factor will be higher for smaller basins (see design guides). Sewers should be designed to carry the peak flow when flowing at a depth of two-thirds ( 2/3 ) pipe diameter. 
                  The city land use plan should be consulted and special consideration given to commercial and industrial areas. Where developers are installing major trunk lines or interceptor sewers, the city's long range plan should be consulted as a guide and the sewer should as a minimum be of the size called for in the long range plan. If proposed land use conditions have changed subsequent to the plan, these changes should be factored into the determination. 
                  (5)  Special city requirements. 
                  (a)  Distance between manholes. Maximum distance between manholes shall be four hundred (400) feet. 
                  (b)  Depth. Any sewers installed in the street shall, topography permitting, be sufficiently deep to provide five (5) feet of cover over service laterals at the street right-of-way, and over any part of the main or service within the street right-of-way. The maximum depth for PVC pipe shall be fifteen (15) feet, depths in excess of this shall be ductile iron. Sewers installed in streets shall have maximum depth of twelve (12) feet unless otherwise approved. Any sewers on off-street easements shall have a minimum of three (3) feet of cover unless ductile iron pipe is used. Filling over the pipe to obtain minimum cover is not allowed. 
                  (c)  Drop across manholes. All manholes shall be provided with, a minimum vertical drop across the manhole (between in and out pipes) of one-fourth (0.25) feet. 
                  (d)  Detection tape. Detection tape shall be installed over all sewer pipe. Bury tape eighteen (18) to twenty-four (24) inches below grade. Use detection wire on all service laterals. 
                  (6)  Slope. All sewers shall be so designed and constructed to give mean velocities, when flowing full, of not less than two (2.0) feet per second based on Manning's formula using an "n" value of 0.013. The following are the minimum slopes which should be provided; however, slopes greater than these are desirable: 
                  Minimum Slope in Feet 

                   
                    
                  These minimum slopes will be used only when sufficient flows are expected to maintain a velocity of two (2.0) feet per second and maintain a cleaning action in the line. Sewers shall be laid with uniform slope between manholes. Sewers on ten (10) percent slope or greater shall be ductile iron pipe and shall be anchored securely with concrete anchors (See standard details) to prevent displacement by erosion or shock. Maximum slope of sewers shall be twenty (20) percent and sewers shall be designed at less than ten (10) percent whenever possible unless otherwise approved. 
                  (7)  Increasing size. When a small sewer is connected to a large one (1), the connection shall not be lower than matching the top of both sewers to the same elevation. 
                  (8)  Gravity sewer pipe materials. The city reserves the right to disallow any manufacturer that does not have a consistent, long-term record of quality control and successful product performance. Gravity sanitary sewer pipe up through fifteen-inch diameter will normally be polyvinyl chloride (PVC), solid wall type SDR 35 thickness meeting ASTM D3034. Ductile iron pipe (DIP) will be used where certain conditions exist (see discussion of DIP). For eighteen-inch diameter pipe and above, the contractor may have the option of using either polyvinyl chloride (PVC), reinforced concrete pipe (RCP), or ductile iron pipe. Bedding for sewer pipe shall be as follows (also see city standard details): 
                  For PVC the minimum bedding shall be #57 or #89 crushed stone a minimum of six (6) inches below bottom of pipe extending up to six (6) inches above top of pipe for the full width of the trench. 
                  For ductile iron pipe the minimum bedding shall be #57 or #89 crushed stone a minimum of six (6) inches below bottom of pipe extending up to the top of pipe. 
                  In wet areas, the minimum bedding requirements will be increased as required to ensure a stable support under the pipe and on the sides of the pipe. 
                  (a)  Ductile iron pipe (DIP). 
                  1.  Scope. Ductile iron sewer pipe shall be required at all utility crossings with less than two (2) feet of clearance, in locations where cover is less than three (3) feet, at stream crossings, where slopes exceed ten (10) percent, and where cover exceeds fifteen (15) feet. 
                  Ductile iron pipe shall be designed in accordance with ANSI Specification A21.50-81. The thickness and class of the pipe shall be governed by ANSI Specification A21.50-81, but shall be no less than class 50 thickness. Pipe shall be manufactured in accordance with ANSI Specification A21.51-81 latest revision. 
                  Pipe shall be coal tar epoxy lined and seal coated with approved bituminous seal coat in accordance with AWWA C151, latest revision. Coal tar epoxy lining shall adhere to the following specifications. 
                  2.  Joints. DIP joints shall be of the bell and spigot type with push-on joints, conforming to ANSI Specification A21.11 or mechanical joints. 
                  (b)  Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) sewer pipe. 
                  1.  Scope. The contractor shall provide unplasticized polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastic gravity sewer pipe meeting the requirements of ASTM D3034 (latest revision) in the sizes shown unless otherwise indicated on the contract documents. 
                  2.  Materials. Pipe and fittings shall meet the requirements as specified under ASTM D3034 (latest revision) for pipe through fifteen (15) inches and ASTM F679 for pipe eighteen (18) inches through twenty-seven (27) inches. All pipe and fittings shall be suitable for use as a gravity sewer conduit. Bell joints shall consist of an integral wall section with elastomeric gasket joint which provides a watertight seal. The pipe shall be capable of passing all tests which are detailed in this specification. Minimum wall thickness shall be SDR 35. 
                  3.  Fittings. All fittings and accessories shall be manufactured and furnished by the pipe supplier. They shall have bell and/or spigot configurations compatible with that of the pipe and shall have an equivalent wall thickness. 
                  4.  Pipe and fittings tests. Before shipping any pipe, the manufacturer shall submit shop drawings to the city and shall furnish written certification that all pipe through fifteen (15) inches meets ASTM Specification D3034 and that pipe eighteen (18) inches through twenty-four (24) inches meets ASTM F679. The city reserves the right to require additional laboratory testing at the developer's expense to verify minimum quality standards are being met. 
                  5.  Pipe stiffness. Minimum "pipe stiffness" (F/Y) at five (5) percent deflection shall be forty-six (46) psi for all sizes, when tested in accordance with ASTM Standard Method of Test D2412 (latest edition), to determine the "External Loading Properties of Plastic Pipe by Parallel-Plate Loading." There shall be no evidence of splitting, cracking, or breaking at a deflection of up to thirty (30) percent of the original diameter. 
                  6.  Fusion quality. There shall be no evidence of flaking, swelling, or disintegration when the pipe material is tested in accordance with ASTM D2152, "Quality of Extruded Poly (Vinyl Chloride) pipe by Acetone Immersion." 
                  7.  Joint tightness. Pipe and fitting joints shall comply with ASTM D3212 (latest edition) for "Joints for drain and Sewer Plastic Pipes Using Flexible Elastomeric Seals." Joint assemblies shall not leak when subjected to both an internal and external hydrostatic test at equivalent pressures of ten and eight-tenths (10.8) psi gauge for a period of one (1) hour. Pipes shall be tested in straight alignment, axially deflected position, and by shear load test as otherwise defined in Paragraphs 7.2, 7.3, and 7.4 of ASTM D3212. 
                  8.  Installation. PVC pipe will be installed in accordance with ASTM D2321 (latest revision). Initial backfill shall be compacted to the densities outlined in D2321. The city may require random compaction tests at the developer's expense to insure compliance with D2321. 
                  9.  Deflection limit. Vertical deflection of installed pipe shall not exceed five (5) percent of the undeflected diameter as defined in ASTM D3034. 
                  Upon completion of the pipe laying, the pipe will be tested for conditional acceptance. The test shall be performed by the contractor pulling a mandrel of specified dimensions through the pipeline. 
                  (c)  Reinforced concrete pipe (RCP). 
                  1.  General. The use of reinforced concrete pipe for sewers will be subject to approval on a case-by-case basis depending upon size of the sewer and site conditions. When approved for use, concrete gravity sewer pipe shall meet all materials and testing requirements of ASTM C-76, ASTM C-443, and ASTM C-497 (except where modified herein). 
                  2.  Quality assurance. The contractor must submit to the owner and engineer the concrete pipe manufacturer's evidence of a working quality control program for approval, prior to any pipe being manufactured. The program and standards of manufacturing must be established and well defined. The program must include the minimum following requirements: 
                  a.  A full time quality control technician. 
                  b.  A complete and working quality control laboratory capable of testing and recording the requirements set forth in these specifications for concrete pipe. 
                  c.  A zero (0) defect program for daily material testing and finished product testing to assure quality control as the pipe is being manufactured and shipped for this particular project. 
                  3.  Guarantee. The contractor shall provide a guarantee against defective materials and workmanship in accordance with the requirements of these specifications. 
                  4.  Material. 
                  a.  All concrete pipe and fittings twelve (12) inches in diameter and larger shall be reinforced concrete sewer pipe conforming to the latest requirements of ASTM C-76 with the following modifications: All concrete pipe with zero (0)—twenty (20) feet of fill shall be a minimum of Class III with four thousand five hundred (4,500) psi concrete.

As a minimum, the horizontal alignment will be staked at one hundred-foot intervals and each manhole will be located with a centerline stake and two (2) offset hubs. "Cuts" to invert elevations will be shown for each manhole entry and exit pipe. 
                  Pipe and accessories shall at all times be handled with care to avoid damage. Whether moved by hand, skidways or hoists, material shall not be dropped or bumped. The interior of all pipe shall be kept free from dirt and foreign matter at all times. Each joint of pipe shall be unloaded opposite or near the place where it is to be laid in the trench. 
                  All such material that is defective in manufacture or has been damaged in transit or after delivery shall be removed from the job site. 
                  Sewer pipes shall be joined by "push-on" joints using elastomeric gaskets to affect the pressure seal. The ends of pipe to be joined and the gaskets shall be cleaned immediately before assembly, and the assembly shall be made as recommended by the pipe manufacturer. Lubricant used must be non-toxic and supplied or approved for use by the pipe manufacturer. Sewer pipes shall be laid in the uphill direction with the bells pointing upgrade. Any variation from this procedure shall require approval from the city. 
                  When pipe laying is not in progress, the open ends of installed pipe shall be plugged with a watertight plug to prevent entrance of trench water into the line. 
                  Bedding for pipe shall normally be as listed below (also see city standard details): 
                  For PVC the minimum bedding shall be #57 or #89 crushed stone a minimum of six (6) inches below the bottom of the pipe to six (6) inches above the top of the pipe for the full width of the trench. 
                  For concrete and ductile iron pipe the minimum bedding shall be #57 or #89 crushed stone a minimum of six (6) inches below bottom of pipe and initial backfill to the top of pipe for the full width of the trench. 
                  In wet areas, the minimum bedding requirements will be increased as required to ensure a stable support under the pipe and on the sides of the pipe. 
                  Backfill material up to twelve (12) inches above the top of the pipe shall be compacted dry, loose, soil unless PVC is used in which case the first six (6) inches above the top of pipe is required to be crushed stone. If such material is not available from the site then #57 stone shall be used to backfill up to twelve (12) inches above the top of the pipe. Backfilling the remainder of the trench may utilize soil and blasted rock (not over twelve (12) inches in any dimension) compacted sufficiently to avoid excessive settlement. Under no circumstances will tree parts, vegetation, building materials or any other type of debris be used for backfill. 
                  All backfill beneath roads, sidewalks or other critical areas shall be compacted to ninety-five (95) percent Standard Proctor or as otherwise required by the DOT or other such agency having jurisdiction using mechanical tamping equipment. Moisture control of the material may be required to achieve this compaction and hauling in of select material may be required. Compaction testing and certification by an independent soil testing company will be required in these areas at the developer's expense. 
                  (7)  Railroad crossings. All railroad crossing shall conform to the requirements of the American Railway Engineering Association Manual for Railway Engineering, Part 5. The contractor shall secure permission from the railroads to schedule the work so as not to interfere with the operation of the railroads. The contractor shall be held responsible for any delays or damages occurring to the railroads. The contractor will furnish the railroad with such additional insurance as may be required, cost of same to be borne by the contractor, together with the costs for flagmen, watchmen, temporary work of any nature, safety devices and any other items that may be imposed by the railroad. 
                  (8)  Highway crossings. All construction work in the state highway right-of-way shall be approved by the state department of transportation. Developer shall be responsible for obtaining encroachment permits. 
                  (9)  Stream crossings. The preferred method of crossing a river, stream, creek, impoundments, or wet weather ditch is with a minimum of six (6) inches of cover between the lowest point in the stream and the top of outside diameter of the pipe. Ductile iron pipe is required for all stream crossings and shall extend a minimum of ten (10) feet beyond the top of bank on each side. Concrete collars or encasement must be provided at all joints for ductile iron pipe with less than three (3) feet of cover. 
                  The stream bed and sides at the crossing site shall be protected from erosion with the use of riprap, as defined and sized in the Manual For Erosion and Sediment Control In Georgia, Appendix C—Construction Materials, 1992 or most current or amended edition. 
                  Aerial crossings will require detailed plans and will be allowed only when, in the city's opinion there is no reasonable alternative. 
                  Erosion control measures shall be installed prior to installing pipe across any stream. All work should be performed when stream flows are at their lowest, and all work should be performed as quickly and safely as possible. As soon as conditions permit, the stream bed shall be cleared of all falsework, debris, and other obstructions placed therein or caused by the construction operations. Erosion control measures can include, but are not limited to, the following items: 
                  (a)  Silt fencing, types A, B, and/or C. 
                  (b)  Erosion control checkdams. 
                  (c)  Channel diversion through temporary storm drain pipe. 
                  (d)  Rock filter dams. 
                  The construction and installation of these various structures are detailed in the Manual for Erosion and Sedimentation Control in Georgia or the state department of transportation standards and construction details, both of which are available for purchase by the contractor. 
                  (10)  Casing for sewers. Where pipe is required to be installed under railroads, highways, streets or other facilities by jacking or boring methods, construction shall be done in a manner that will not interfere with the operation of the facility, and shall not weaken the roadbed or structure. 
                  The diameter of the bore shall conform to the outside diameter and circumference of the casing pipe as closely as practicable. Any voids which develop during the installation operation shall be pressure grouted. Each segment of the casing pipe shall be welded (full circumference butt weld) to the adjoining segment. The completed casing shall have no sags or crowns which cause the grade for any segment to be less than the minimum slope for the size pipe being installed. 
                  The carrier pipe shall be fitted with approved spacers to secure its position within the casing. At each end of the casing pipe the void between the carrier pipe and casing shall be sealed with brick and mortar. 
                  (11)  Replacement of pavement. Contractor shall fully restore and replace all pavement, curbs, gutters, sidewalks and other surface structures removed or disturbed, to a condition that is equal to or better than the original condition in a manner satisfactory to the city (see standard details). 
                  (12)  Location/protection of existing underground utilities. It is the responsibility of the contractor to locate all underground utilities and to protect same. Utility lines or services damaged by the contractor shall be repaired by the contractor at the contractor's own expense. The contractor has sole responsibility of complying with all provisions of the Utilities Protection Code. 
                  (13)  Protection of water supply and other utilities. The city has an established cross-connection program (3/6/86) to prevent the entry of contaminants or pollutants into any area of the potable water supply through the control of cross connections. It is illegal to introduce any substance into or to have any cross connections with the potable water supply. There shall be no physical connection between a public or private potable water supply system and a sanitary sewer which would permit the passage of any sewage or polluted water into the potable water supply. 
                  Whenever possible, sewers should be laid at least ten (10) feet horizontally from any existing or proposed water main. Should conditions prevent a separation of ten (10) feet, the lines shall be laid in separate trenches. 
                  (14)  Sewer services. A sewer service shall be provided for every existing or proposed lot or building. All sewer services shall be a minimum of six (6) inches in diameter unless otherwise specified. All service lines shall be designed to maintain a minimum of two (2) feet/second sewer velocity. All services shall be shown on the construction and as-built drawings. A common service shall not be allowed for two (2) or more buildings. The service shall extend to five (5) feet inside the property line of the lot being served and normally be within ten (10) feet of the lower corner of the lot. All service laterals shall be a minimum of five (5) feet deep at the property line. Where five (5) feet of cover cannot be achieved, sewer services shall be constructed of ductile iron. A ninety-degree bend, constructed from two (2) forty-five-degree fittings shall be installed at the end of all sewer services with a vertical section of pipe to extend a minimum of four (4) feet above existing ground level (See standard details). Connections to the main exceeding eight (8) feet in depth may have the saddle or tee rotated to a bend inserted in the service to provide five-foot lateral depth at the property line. 
                  The developer shall be responsible for serving all lots developed. On any lot where the service cannot be found, the developer shall be responsible for payment of the cost of installation of the service. Also, unless noted on the final plat, the service shall be low enough to serve the first floor elevation at the building line. 
                  Install fourteen (14) gauge detector wire on all laterals. 
                  The builder shall be responsible for the location of the service prior to the pouring of the foundation, driveway or other appurtenance. The city will not be responsible for any house built too low to be served nor for any service covered by construction. 
                  No plumber or contractor will be allowed to connect to the sewerage system except to the end of the service provided for his connection. Also, any service provided will be utilized without the installation of additional services. 
                  (15)  Clean up. Prior to requesting the "completion of sewer construction" inspection, the contractor shall remove and dispose of in an acceptable manner all shipping timbers, shipping bands, spacers, excess materials, broken material, crates, boxes and any other material brought to the job site. 
                  Any work areas within public right-of-way or property outside of the development that were damaged by the sewer construction shall be repaired or replaced with the same kind of material as existed prior to the damage occurring. All easement areas shall be cleared of trees, stumps and other debris and left in a condition such that the easement can be maintained by bush-hog equipment. 
                  All shoulders, ditches, culverts, and other areas impacted by the sewer construction shall be at the proper grades and smooth in appearance. All manhole covers shall be brought to grade. 
                  A uniform stand of grass or mulch for erosion protection, as defined in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia, is required over all construction easements and sanitary sewer easements prior to the city's acceptance of the sewer. Use a grass mixture consisting of at least fifty (50) percent fescue. 
                  (Ord. No. 32-98, § 1, 8-27-98; Ord. No. 50-98, § 7, 1-7-99) 
                  Sec. 7.5-95. - Inspection of sewers. 
                  (1)  City inspection. The developer's contractor will be responsible for the quality, accuracy and workmanship of his completed work. City personnel will visit the job site on a periodic basis and will make spot checks as they deem appropriate. The city shall have the right to review and inspect all construction and may reject any work that does not meet quality control standards. 
                  (2)  Access to project. Authorized representatives of the city, which may include city employees, the city engineer, state or federal agencies, shall have access to the site for inspection at any time. 
                  (3)  Communications during construction. A preconstruction conference will be required for all projects. The developer has sole responsibility for scheduling. The developer, design professional, contractor, and subcontractor(s) are required to meet with the city and all private utilities in this conference. The contractor will notify the city in writing two (2) days before starting construction. The contractor will provide notification by phone any time the work is to be vacated and will provide notice by phone prior to resuming work. The contractor shall request the final inspection. The city inspector may have informal verbal communications with the contractor foreman or superintendent at any time during construction. The city inspector will not direct the actions of contractor's workmen. 
                  (4)  Concealed work. The city inspector may direct that the contractor notify the city and receive inspection approval prior to concealing certain work such as manhole foundations, pipe bedding, tees, bends, service laterals, or other appurtenances. At the city's discretion, the city may require work to be uncovered which was not inspected prior to backfilling. 
                  (5)  Minimum inspection by developer. The following minimum information shall be determined and certified by the engineer: 
                  (a)  Horizontal location. Horizontal location of the line will be checked by measuring as-built distances between manholes and bearings from manhole to manhole. 
                  (b)  Elevation and slope. Elevation of each invert and top of manhole will be measured and recorded. Actual pipe slope will be computed and any segment having less than minimum allowable slope will be rejected and re-done. 
                  (6)  City inspection. Cost for all testing shall be paid for by the developer. 
                  (a)  Manhole construction. Manholes will be visually inspected to check for plugging of lift holes, use of connecting boots, use of joint material, leakage, proper invert construction, proper setting of frame and cover. 
                  (b)  Pipe straightness. Sections of sewer line will be visually checked for straightness. A passing section shall show at least eighty (80) percent of a full circle when observed from one (1) end. Any section which fails this visual test shall be further checked. The section shall have water run through it sufficient to fill any sags that may exist. Then it shall have a television camera pulled through it to check for sags. Any sag holding more than one and one-half inches (1½) of water will require that the pipe be removed and replaced to proper grade after which the section shall be televised again to verify correction. The contractor may propose alternative methods other than televising sewers for the city's approval to determine failing sections of sewers. 
                  (c)  Infiltration. The allowable limit for any section from manhole to manhole will be one hundred (100) gallons per day per inch of pipe diameter per mile of pipe. If any infiltration is present at the most downstream point, then it will be measured using a specially-made weir and measurements will also be made at each upstream manhole that has any visible flow of water. Any individual segment which exceeds the allowable infiltration shall be corrected to within allowable limits. 
                  (d)  Compaction of backfill. Compaction testing may be required for sewers constructed in paved areas or where pavement is planned. A minimum of two (2) tests per five hundred (500) feet of trench line located in roadways will be required. If any of these tests show failing results, then the failing backfill will be removed, re-compacted and re-tested, and one (1) additional area will be tested as well. 
                  (7)  Other testing requirements. The tests listed below shall be performed by the contractor in the presence of the city. The city will be notified at least two (2) days prior to these tests. 
                  (a)  Mandrel test for PVC pipe. Procedure for testing PVC sewer pipe for maximum allowable deflection shall be generally as follows (Mandrel sized to ninety-five (95) percent of the nominal internal pipe diameter): 
                  1.  Completely flush the line making sure the pipe is clean of any mud or trash that would hinder the passage of the mandrel. 
                  2.  During the final flushing of the line, attach a floating block or ball to the end of the mandrel pull rope and float the rope through the line (a nylon ski rope is recommended). 
                  3.  After the rope is threaded through the line, connect the pull rope to the mandrel and place the mandrel in the entrance of the pipe. 
                  4.  Connect a second rope to the back of the mandrel. This will enable the mandrel to be retrieved if excessive deflection is encountered. 
                  5.  Draw the mandrel through the sewer line. 
                  6.  An increasing resistance to pull is an indication of excessive deflection. If this occurs mark the rope to note the location. Televise the sewer section to identify the extent of the problem and develop a plan, subject to city approval, for correcting the problem. The contractor may propose an alternative method other than televising sewers for the city's approval to determine locations of failing sewers. 
                  7.  Retest. 
                  (b)  Air pressure test. A low pressure test of each sewer line section will be conducted by the contractor to check for leaks. The following general procedures will apply (also refer to ASTM specs): 
                  1.  Temporarily plug the line segment between two (2) manholes using plugs having air tight fittings through which low pressure air can be introduced into the pipe segment being tested. 
                  2.  Introduce low pressure air into the test pipe segment until the internal air pressure reaches four and one-half (4.5) psig above ground water pressure, if any. 
                  3.  Wait at least five (5) minutes for air temperature in the test segment to stabilize while internal air pressure remains no less than three and one-half (3.5) psig above ground water pressure. 
                  4.  Bleed internal air pressure to exactly three and one-half (3.5) psig above ground water pressure. 
                  5.  Accurately determine the elapsed time for internal pressure to drop to two and one-half (2.5) psig above ground water pressure. 
                  6.  The air test is acceptable if elapsed time is no less than shown on the following table: 

                   
                  Air leakage time is based on pipe being damp. If pipe and joints are dry, dampen line if helpful in meeting air test time requirement. 
                  Permanently correct excessive leakage determined by air testing, and repeat operations until the city witnesses a successful test on each line segment. 
                  Upon request, the city may allow substitution of exfiltration test in lieu of air pressure test. If used, the exfiltration test will be conducted with a minimum water head of two (2) feet above the groundwater table and the allowable exfiltration will be limited to one hundred (100) gallons per day per inch diameter of pipe per mile of pipe. 
                  (c)  Manhole testing. All manholes require testing by either the vacuum test or exfiltration test. 
                  1.  Exfiltration test. Manholes which have been backfilled around shall be tested for exfiltration. The minimum test time duration is one (1) hour. Manholes shall be filled with water to the top of ring. The maximum allowable exfiltration rate is two (2) gallons/foot of depth/foot of manhole diameter. 
                  2.  Vacuum test. Vacuum testing of manholes for watertightness may be used in lieu of the exfiltration test prior to backfilling. After temporarily plugging pipe openings and installing the vacuum base on top of the cone, a vacuum of ten (10) inches of Mercury shall be drawn and the vacuum pump shut off. With valves closed, the pressure shall be monitored for a time period of sixty (60) seconds. At the end of the test period, if the vacuum is nine (9) inches or greater, the manhole has passed the test. If the vacuum drops below nine (9) inches, the manhole has failed. 
                  (8)  Final inspection and conditional acceptance. In no circumstances shall any buildings and plumbing fixtures be connected to the sewers until inspected and approved by the city. The contractor shall request in writing a final inspection. This final inspection will generally include spot checks of manholes and sewer lines and a complete overview of the project. 
                  After any discrepancies are corrected, the city will issue a letter, certifying conditional acceptance of the sewer system. This letter shall commence the start of the twelve-month warranty period which is required of the contractor. On projects having phased development, this letter will allow the developer to apply for a permit for the next phase of development. 
                  At the end of twelve (12) months, the subdivision inspection team will again reinspect the entire development. When all discrepancies have been corrected, the city will issue an acceptance letter and will begin perpetual maintenance and operation of the sewerage system. 
                  (9)  Maintenance bond or letter of credit. The developer shall post a maintenance bond or letter of credit of ten (10) percent of the total project cost on the facility for an eighteen-month period after completion and conditional acceptance of the facility by the city for all projects whose costs exceed twenty thousand dollars ($20,000.00). 
                  (10)  Maintenance until final acceptance. It shall be the developer's obligation to provide all maintenance for a twelve-month period after conditional acceptance of the project by the city. At the end of the twelve-month maintenance period the city shall inspect the sewer system, and upon correction by the developer of all deficiencies noted by the city, the city will accept the sewer system for operation.

                  Sec. 7.5-126. - Water system construction. 
                  (1)  Generally. 
                  (a)  It shall be expressly understood that these specifications are for installation of all underground water mains and appurtenances. 
                  (b)  All work shall conform to the applicable provisions of the AWWA specifications of latest revision except as otherwise specified herein. 
                  (2)  Trench excavation. 
                  (a)  Trenches shall have a minimum width of twenty-four (24) inches or the diameter of the outside of the bell of the water main plus twelve (12) inches, (whichever is greater), and the depth thereof shall be such that there shall be a minimum of forty-two (42) inches of cover measured below the roadway surface, natural ground, or proposed grade to the top of the pipe. In cases where water lines cross sanitary sewers, there shall be a minimum of two (2) feet vertical separation between the water and sewer mains. In cases where water mains parallel sewer mains there shall be a minimum of ten (10) feet horizontal separation maintained between the mains. 
                  Trenches shall be dug so that the pipe can be laid to the alignment and depth required, and the trench shall be of such width and shall be braced and drained so that the workmen may work therein safely and efficiently. No chocking under the pipe will be permitted. All joints shall be as specified herein. Excavation must be made under the bell of each pipe so that the entire length of the pipe will lie uniformly on the bottom of the trench and the pipe weight shall not rest on the bells. Trenches shall be free of water during the work. 
                  Water lines shall have a minimum cover of forty-two (42) inches. All changes in grade shall be made gradually. At points of interference with storm sewers and cross drains, pipe will be run under the conflicting utility if the minimum cover cannot be maintained by going over the top of the pipe. 
                  In laying pipe across water courses, railroad crossings, or depressions of any kind, the minimum depth here specified shall be maintained at the bottom of the depression. 
                  Where necessary, the line shall be lowered at valves so that the top of the valve stem is approximately one (1) foot below the finished grade. The trench shall be deepened to provide a gradual approach to all low points of the line. 
                  (b)  Wherever rock is encountered in the excavation, it shall be removed by suitable means. If blasting is used for removal of rock, the contractor shall take all proper safety precautions. He shall comply with all rules and regulations for the protection of life and property that may be imposed by any public body having jurisdiction relative to the handling, storing and use of explosives. Before blasting, the contractor shall cover the excavation with heavy timbers and mats in such a manner as to protect the adjacent property owners from damage. All rock encountered shall be removed six (6) inches below the bottom grade of the trench and the trench built back to the correct grade with suitable material tamped into place. Sides of the trench shall be trimmed of projecting rock that will interfere with backfilling operations. The contractor shall be wholly responsible for any damage resulting from blasting. Rock excavation by blasting shall be at least seventy-five (75) feet in advance of pipe laying. 
                  (c)  After the pipe has been laid, backfilling shall be performed in two (2) distinct operations. In general, all backfill beneath, around and to a depth of twenty-four (24) inches above the top of the pipe shall be placed in six-inch layers for the full width of the trench and thoroughly compacted by hand with vibratory equipment. Care shall be taken so that the pipe is not laterally displaced during backfilling operations. The backfill lifts shall be placed by an approved method in accordance with that hereinafter specified. Backfill materials shall be the excavated materials without bricks, stone, foreign matter or corrosive materials, where not otherwise specified or indicated on the plans. 
                  (d)  Backfill under permanent concrete or bituminous pavement and as elsewhere specified or indicated on the plans shall be as shown in the standard detail drawings for trenches in paved areas. Mechanical vibrating equipment shall be used to achieve the required compaction. 
                  (e)  Backfill under gravel or crushed stone surfaced roadways and low-type bituminous surfaced roadways shall be approved suitable excavated material placed in twelve-inch layers and thoroughly compacted for the full depth and width of the trench, conforming to the compaction, density compaction method and materials as specified in subsection (d) above. 
                  (f)  Backfill in unpaved areas shall be compacted with mechanical vibrating equipment to ninety-five (95) percent as determined by the Standard Proctor Test. Trenches shall be compacted so they will not settle. If settlement occurs, trenches are to be refilled, recompacted and regraded. Backfill material from pipe bedding to ground surface shall be excavated earth free from large stones and other debris. 
                  (g)  Contractor shall fully restore and replace all pavement, surface structures, grassing, landscaping, etc., removed or disturbed as part of the work to a condition equal to that before the work began. All pavement removal shall be replaced per standard detail drawings. 
                  (h)  Where sheeting is used in connection with the work, it is in no case to be withdrawn before the trench is sufficiently filled to prevent damage to banks, road surfaces, adjacent pipes, adjacent structures or adjacent property, public or private. 
                  (3)  Laying pipe. All pipe shall be laid straight, true to line and grade. Bell and coupling holes shall be dug in the trench and the pipe shall have a continuous bearing with the trench bottom between bell or coupling holes. No shimming or blocking up of the pipe shall be allowed. When the work is not going on, all pipe openings shall be securely closed by the insertion of the proper size plug and caulking so that dirt and debris will not be washed into the pipe in case of rain. 
                  In making the joints with ductile iron pipe, the spigot end of the pipe and the inside of the bell shall be thoroughly cleaned and the gasket inspected to see that it is properly placed; lubricant shall be applied to the spigot end of the pipe and it shall be inserted into the bell of the adjoining pipe to the stop mark on the pipe. 
                  (4)  Thrust restraint for pressure lines. 
                  (a)  Reaction blocking. 
                  1.  Underground piping laid around curves and at all unsupported changes of direction, all tees, wyes, crosses, plugs and other like fittings shall be solidly and properly blocked with concrete against solid earth to take the reaction of the main pressure and to prevent lateral movement of the pipe or fittings when under pressure. Reaction blocking shall be installed at all locations requiring same and where tie rods and clamps are not called for in the plans. Concrete for reaction blocking shall have a minimum compressive strength of three thousand (3,000) psi at twenty-eight (28) days. The blocking, unless otherwise shown, shall be so placed that the pipe and fitting joints will be accessible for repair. In addition to the concrete blocking specified herein, all mechanical joint fittings shall be installed with Mega-Lug retainer glands. 
                  2.  Reaction blocking shall be constructed as per AWWA Standard C600 Section 3.8, latest revision. It shall be constructed in conformance with the Standard Detail Drawings for Reaction Blocking. 
                  (b)  Retainer glands. Mechanical joint fittings on ductile iron pipe shall be installed with retainer glands. Retainer glands are to be Mega-Lug retainer glands as manufactured by EBBA Iron. 
                  1.  Clean the socket and the plain end. Lubrication and additional cleaning should be provided by brushing both the gasket and the plain end with soapy water or an approved pipe lubricant meeting the requirements of ANSI C111 or AWWA A21.11 just prior to slipping the gland and gasket onto the plain end for joint assembly. Place the gland on the plain end with the lip extension toward the plain end, followed by the gasket. 
                  2.  Insert the pipe into the socket and press the gasket firmly and evenly into the gasket recess. Keep the joint straight during assembly. 
                  3.  Push the gland toward the socket and center it around the pipe with the gland lip against the gasket. Insert bolts and hand tighten nuts. Make deflection after joint assembly but before tightening bolts. 
                  4.  Tighten the bolts to the normal range of bolt torque specified in AWWA C600 while at all times maintaining approximately the same distance between the gland and the face of the flange at all points around the socket. 
                  5.  Tighten the torque limiting twist off nuts in a clock-wise direction until all wedges are in firm contact with the pipe surface. Continue tightening in an alternate manner until all of the nuts have been twisted off. 
                  (5)  Setting fire hydrants. Fire hydrants shall be placed at the locations shown on the plans or as directed by the city. All fire hydrants shall be installed with a resilient seat gate for isolation from the main. Gate valves for fire hydrants shall be connected directly to the main by means of a "Locked Hydrant Tee." Fire hydrants shall be connected to the isolation valve with a locked hydrant adapter. Installations where locked hydrant tees or locked hydrant adapters cannot be utilized, either due to distance from the main or size, shall be restrained with retainers glands and threaded rods. Care shall be exercised that set screws and retainer glands are tightened sufficiently to secure the hydrants before pressure is put on the main. Not less than nine (9) cubic feet of coarse, broken stone shall be placed around the base of the hydrants, as shown in the standard detail drawings, Section 400. Before placing the hydrants, care shall be taken to see that all foreign material is removed from within the body. The stuffing boxes shall be tightened and the hydrant valve opened and closed to see that all parts are in first class working condition. All hydrant openings shall be kept capped, except when hydrant is being worked on. Existing fire hydrants shall not be operated without permission of the city. 
                  When a fire hydrant has been constructed but is not yet in service, the contractor shall provide and attach to the fire hydrant, flags or collars indicating that the fire hydrant is not in service. Said flags or collars shall remain on the fire hydrant until it is put into service. 
                  Whenever an existing fire hydrant is taken out of service, whether temporarily or permanently, it shall be equipped with a flag or collar indicating that it is not in service. The contractor shall provide and install flags or collars as required and shall notify the fire department whenever the operating status of any fire hydrant changes. 
                  Fire hydrants shall not be operated with any tool except a specifically designed fire hydrant wrench. If the contractor observes any other contractor or person operating a fire hydrant with an unapproved fire hydrant wrench, he shall report that fact to the city immediately. It is the contractor's responsibility to insure that all new facilities are maintained in new condition until final completion of the project and acceptance by the city. Fire hydrants with damaged operating nuts shall not be accepted. 
                  (6)  Setting valves and fittings. Valves shall be set plumb, and shall have cast iron valve boxes. The valve boxes shall be placed directly over the valve and set plumb, the top of the box being brought to the surface of the ground. Provide valve extensions on all valves with operating nuts more than three (3) feet in depth. Valve extensions shall bring the operating nut to within eighteen (18) inches of the surface and shall be keyed into the valve nut. After the boxes are in place, earth shall be filled in the trench and thoroughly tamped around the box. After all settlement has taken place, a precast concrete collar shall be installed for each valve box. 
                  Fittings shall be properly restrained to insure that they will not be blown off or broken loose under the greatest possible working pressure (see standard detail drawings). All fittings shall be mechanical joint and shall be installed with Mega-Lug retainer glands and concrete blocking unless specified otherwise. In situations where there is insufficient undisturbed earth to act as a bearing surface or where otherwise directed by the city, fittings shall be restrained by the use of threaded rods or other method acceptable to the city. 
                  Prior to blocking any joint or fitting with concrete, that joint or fitting shall be wrapped with polyethylene film in such a manner that the concrete will not stick directly to the pipe but that the load bearing capacity of the blocking will not be affected. Care shall be taken to prevent the concrete from covering bolts. Polyethylene film shall be installed at other points along the water main where so directed by the city. 
                  (7)  Placing of steel casing pipe. Casing pipe shall be installed at the location shown on the plans. Unless directed otherwise, the installation procedure shall be by the dry bore method. The hole is to be mechanically bored and cased through the soil by a cutting head on a continuous auger mounted inside the casing pipe. The installation of the casing and boring of the hole shall be done simultaneously by jacking. Lengths of pipe are to be adequately welded to the preceding section installed. Excavation material will be removed and placed at the top of the working pit. Backfill material and methods of backfilling and tamping shall be as required under backfilling. Carrier pipe shall be inserted within the casing by use of stainless steel casing spacers. Intervals shall be as detailed in Section 805.24.

                  (Ord. No. 32-98, § 1, 8-27-98; Ord. No. 50-98, § 8, 1-7-99) 
                  Sec. 7.5-127. - Inspection and tests. 
                  (1)  Scope. This section pertains to the inspection and testing of installed water lines requiring testing for assuring proper operation and service and/or specifically specified to be tested. In general, all lines designed to operate under pressure shall be successfully tested. Tests of installed piping shall consist of a pressure and leakage test. All piping to be tested must satisfactorily comply with the pressure tests before being eligible for acceptance. In general, tests shall be conducted in accordance with AWWA Standard C-600 except as otherwise herein specified. 
                  (2)  Testing. 
                  (a)  After all piping has been placed, each run shall be tested by the contractor in the presence of the inspector and tests shall be continued until all leaks have been made tight to the satisfaction of the inspector. The contractor shall furnish all necessary water, meters, pumps, gauges, bulkheads, and other materials and appliances necessary to conduct the test as herein required. Every precaution must be taken to valve-off or otherwise protect control equipment in or attached to the pipe line to prevent damage or injury thereto. All piping shall be tested at two hundred (200) psi for a minimum test duration of one (1) hour. The city or its representative may require a twenty-four-hour test if it so desires. 
                  (b)  Before applying the specified test pressure, all air shall be expelled from the pipe. If hydrants, blow-offs or air release valves are not available at the high places, the contractor shall make the necessary taps, as per the standard detail for tap construction, at points of highest elevation before the test is made and close the corporation stop after the test has been completed. 
                  (c)  Prior to the pressure test, pipe laid in trenches shall be backfilled adequately to secure the pipe during the test. Any observed leakage shall require corrective measures to pipe lines and/or joints as otherwise provided for in these specifications and to the satisfaction of the inspector. During the final pressure test the specified pressure shall be maintained in the pipe being tested for a minimum time of one (1) hour. Test pressure shall be maintained within five (5) psi of the specified test pressure for the duration of the test. Should the pressure drop more than five (5) psi at any time during the test period, the pressure shall be restored to the specified test pressure. An accurate pressure gauge with graduation not greater than five (5) psi shall be used. 
                  (d)  The city will furnish the necessary water for testing the lines. However, any water lost through breakage of lines or unnecessary or excessive flushing of line will be charged to the contractor. Each valved section must be flushed and tested at a pressure of two hundred (200) psi for one (1) hour. Lines shall be tested in sections in a manner that assures testing of the tapping valve and all main line valves. When testing at the above specified pressures, the rate of leakage shall not exceed fifteen (15) gallons per twenty-four (24) hours per inch diameter per mile of line. See the table below. 

                   
                  Any section of the line not meeting the above test shall have the leaks found and corrected at once and re-tested until the leakage falls within the limits specified above. Leakage shall be defined as the sum of the quantity of water that must be pumped into the test section to maintain the pressure within five (5) psi of the specified test pressure for the test duration plus water required to return the line to test pressure at the end of the test. 
                  (e)  All fire hydrants shall be flushed to check operations. 
                  (f)  All valves shall be located and operation checked. 
                  (3)  Disinfection. After leakage testing, and all necessary repairs have been made, the lines shall be flushed clean and then disinfected in strict accordance with AWWA Standard For Disinfecting Water Mains, AWWA C651, latest revision subject to the following special conditions: 
                  (a)  The method of disinfection shall be the continuous-feed method as follows: 
                  1.  Apply chlorine solution to achieve a concentration of at least twenty-five (25) milligrams per liter free chlorine in new line. Retain chlorinated water for twenty-four (24) hours. 
                  2.  Chlorine concentration shall be recorded at selected outlets along the line at the beginning and end of the twenty-four-hour period. 
                  3.  After twenty-four (24) hours, all samples of water shall contain at least ten (10) milligrams per liter free chlorine. Re-chlorinate if results are not obtained on all samples. 
                  (b)  The form of chlorine may be either: (1) a one (1) percent solution made from either sodium hypochlorite or calcium chlorine gas cylinder supplying a vacuum-type chlorinator, or (2) making a solution and pumping it into the pipeline. 
                  (c)  The contractor shall dechlorinate the highly-chlorinated water being flushed from the pipeline or otherwise dispose of in a manner complying with state environmental regulations. 
                  (d)  The developer shall be responsible for collecting bacteriological samples under city supervision. The city shall perform the initial bacteriological testing of water samples from the disinfected pipeline at no charge. The contractor shall be responsible for charges on all failed tests. 
                  (e)  Before any flushing or disinfection work is begun, the contractor shall outline his planned procedures for these tasks and obtain approval of the city. 
                  (4)  Contractor qualifications. 
                  (a)  Licensing and safety. All contractors who work on water systems that will be owned by the city must be licensed in accordance with state law and local ordinance. Compliance with applicable safety regulations is the responsibility of each company engaged in the work; the city assumes no responsibility for the actions of others on the job site.

                  --- (2) --- 
                  Editor's note— Ord. No. 04-15, adopted Mar. 5, 2015, repealed the former art. VI, §§ 7.5-151—7.5-157, and enacted a new art. VI as set out herein. The former art. VI pertained to similar subject matter and derived from: Ord. No. 32-98, § 1, adopted Aug. 27, 1998; and Ord. No. 60-06, adopted Aug. 17, 2006. 

                  Sec. 7.5-150. - Introduction. 
                  It is hereby determined that: 
                  The flood hazard areas of the City of Cartersville are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  Flood hazard areas can serve important stormwater management, water quality, streambank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation and ecological purposes when permanently protected as undisturbed or minimally disturbed areas. 
                  Effective floodplain management and flood hazard protection activities can: (1) protect human life and health; (2) minimize damage to private property; (3) minimize damage to public facilities and infrastructure such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; and (4) minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public. 
                  Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a), have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, Cartersville, Georgia, does ordain the ordinance codified in this article and establishes this set of floodplain management and flood hazard reduction provisions for the purpose of regulating the use of flood hazard areas. It is determined that the regulation of flood hazard areas and the prevention of flood damage are in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety, as well as to private and public property. 
                  Floodplain management involves the designation of flood-prone areas and the managing of their uses. It is also aimed at minimizing modifications to streams, reducing flood hazards, and protecting the beneficial uses of the floodplain such as water quality protection. As such, floodplain management can be seen as a subset of the larger consideration of surface water and stormwater management. Floodplain regulations and development restrictions can greatly reduce future flooding impacts, preserve greenspace and habitat, and protect their function in safely conveying floodwaters and protecting water quality. This article aims to help the county integrate floodplain management with stormwater management during the land development process. 
                  The article requires that the county regulate the floodplains that will be expected with future land use conditions, which are based upon the communities adopted future land use map, zoning, or watershed study projections. The ordinance also requires the county to regulate floodplains on all streams with a drainage area of one hundred (100) acres and greater. 
                  In order to administer the ordinance, "future-conditions" floodplains must be established: 
                  (1)  Future-conditions floodplains for streams with a drainage area of one (1) square mile (640 acres) and greater in size are to be delineated by the local jurisdiction. As required in the Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District, District-Wide Watershed Management Plan, cities and counties are expected to model and map at least ten (10) percent of their area each year until future-conditions floodplains have been established for the entire community. 
                  (2)  For streams with a drainage area between one hundred (100) acres and six hundred forty (640) acres, the local jurisdiction shall model and map the future-conditions floodplains or require the future-conditions floodplains be determined on a per development basis by the applicant. 
                  (3)  For development projects in watersheds of any size where future-conditions floodplains have not yet been established, the applicant will be required to determine the future-conditions floodplain boundaries located on their property in accordance with approved methodologies and in compliance with this article. 
                  (Ord. No. 04-15, § 1, 3-5-15) 
                  Sec. 7.5-151. - General provisions. 
                  (a)  Purpose and intent. The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in flood hazard areas, as well as to protect the beneficial uses of floodplain areas for water quality protection, streambank and stream corridor protection, wetlands preservation, and ecological and environmental protection by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to flooding or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities or erosion; 
                  (3)  Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
                  (4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; 
                  (5)  Limit the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; and 
                  (6)  Protect the stormwater management, water quality, streambank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation, and ecological functions of natural floodplain areas. 
                  (b)  Applicability. This article shall be applicable to all areas within the jurisdiction of the City of Cartersville. 
                  (c)  Designation of ordinance administrator. The city engineer, chief building official or their designee is hereby appointed to administer and implement the provisions of the ordinance codified in this article. 
                  (d)  Basis for establishing areas of special flood hazard, areas of future-conditions flood hazard and associated floodplain characteristics - flood area maps and studies. For the purposes of defining and determining "areas of special flood hazard," "areas of future-conditions flood hazard," "areas of shallow flooding," "base flood elevations," "floodplains," "floodways," "future-conditions flood elevations," "future-conditions floodplains," potential flood hazard or risk categories as shown on FIRM maps, and other terms used in this article, the following documents and sources may be used for such purposes and are adopted by reference thereto: 
                  (1)  The Flood Insurance Study (FIS), dated September 28, 2007, with accompanying maps and other supporting data and any revision thereto. [For those land areas acquired by a municipality through annexation, the current effective FIS and data for (Bartow County), dated September 28, 2007, with accompanying maps and other supporting data and any revision thereto.] 
                  (2)  Other studies, which may be relied upon for the establishment of the base flood elevation or delineation of the base or one (1) percent (100-year) floodplain and flood-prone areas, including: 
                  a.  Any flood or flood-related study conducted by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the United States Geological Survey or any other local, state or federal agency applicable to the City of Cartersville; and 
                  b.  Any base flood study conducted by a licensed professional engineer which has been prepared utilizing FEMA-approved methodology and approved by the City of Cartersville. 
                  (3)  Other studies, which may be relied upon for the establishment of the future-conditions flood elevation or delineation of the future-conditions floodplain and flood-prone areas, including:

                  b.  Any future-conditions flood study conducted by a licensed professional engineer which has been prepared utilizing FEMA-approved methodology approved by the City of Carteresville. 
                  (4)  The repository for public inspection of the FIS, accompanying maps and other supporting data is located at the office of public works. 
                  (e)  Compatibility with other regulations. This article is not intended to modify or repeal any other ordinance, rule, regulation, statute, easement, covenant, deed restriction or other provision of law. The requirements of this article are in addition to the requirements of any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, and where any provision of this article imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, whichever provision is more restrictive or imposes higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall control. 
                  (f)  Severability. If the provisions of any section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this article shall be adjudged invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such judgment shall not affect or invalidate the remainder of any section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this article. 
                  (g)  Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection required by this article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur; flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This article does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This article shall not create liability on the part of the City of Cartersville or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this article or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.

Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  "Structure" means a walled and roofed building (including a gas or liquid storage tank), that is principally above ground, or a manufactured home. 
                  "Subdivision" means the division of a tract or parcel of land resulting in one (1) or more new lots or building sites for the purpose, whether immediately or in the future, of sale, other transfer of ownership or land development, and includes divisions of land resulting from or made in connection with the layout or development of a new street or roadway or a change in an existing street or roadway. For purposes of this article, the definition of subdivision herein supersedes the definition of subdivision in other parts of the City of Cartersville Code of Ordinances. 
                  "Substantial damage" means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to it's before-damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. This term also includes "repetitive loss." 
                  "Substantial improvement" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement to a structure, taking place during a ten-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure prior to the improvement. The market value of the building means: (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement; or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions, which have been identified by the code enforcement official. The term does also not include any alteration of a historic structure; provided that, the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
                  "Substantially improved existing manufactured home park or subdivision" means the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  "Variance" means a grant of relief from the requirements of this article. 
                  "Violation" means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the requirements of this article. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  Sec. 7.5-154. - Standards for development. 
                  (a)  Definition of floodplain boundaries. 
                  (1)  Studied "A" Zones, as identified in the FIS, shall be used to establish base flood elevations whenever available. 
                  (2)  For all streams with a drainage area of one hundred (100) acres or greater, the future-conditions flood elevations shall be provided by the City of Cartersville. If future-conditions elevation data is not available from the City of Cartersville, then it shall be determined by a licensed professional engineer using a method approved by FEMA and the City of Cartersville. 
                  (b)  Definition of floodway boundaries. The width of a floodway shall be determined from the FIS or FEMA approved flood study. For all streams with a drainage area of one hundred (100) acres or greater, the regulatory floodway shall be provided by the City of Cartersville. If floodway data is not available from the City of Cartersville, it shall be determined by a licensed professional engineer using a method approved by FEMA and the City of Cartersville. 
                  (1)  Developments or subdivisions. If the request involves a development or subdivision, the developer or subdivider shall either pay for the city to conduct the study, or shall pay an impendent consultant to provide the data, provided that consultant is first approved by the city engineer. If floodway data is provided by the city, the developer or subdivider shall pay the pro rata share of the costs of the consultant to map the relevant basin. 
                  (2)  Individual lots. If the request involves an individual lot not part of a larger common plan of development, or a pre-existing lot in an existing subdivision, then the individual shall consult with the city engineer. The city engineer shall make the determination whether to require additional floodway data at the applicant's expense, to expedite county mapping of the relevant area, or to accept the existing data as sufficient. 
                  (c)  General standards. 
                  (1)  No development shall be allowed within any area of special flood hazard or area of future-conditions flood hazard that could result in any of the following: 
                  a.  Raising the base flood elevation or future-conditions flood elevation equal to or more than 0.01 foot; 
                  b.  Reducing the base flood or future-conditions flood storage capacity; 
                  c.  Changing the flow characteristics as to the depth and velocity of the waters of the base flood or future-conditions flood as they pass both the upstream and the downstream boundaries of the development area; or 
                  d.  Creating hazardous or erosion-producing velocities, or resulting in excessive sedimentation. 
                  (2)  Any development within any area of special flood hazard or area of future-conditions flood hazard allowed under subsection 7.5-154(a) shall also meet the following conditions: 
                  a.  Compensation for storage capacity shall occur between the average groundwater table elevation and the base flood elevation for the base flood, and between the average groundwater table elevation and the future-condition flood elevation for the future-conditions flood, and lie either within the boundaries of ownership of the property being developed and shall be within the immediate vicinity of the location of the encroachment. Acceptable means of providing required compensation include lowering of natural ground elevations within the floodplain, or lowering of adjoining land areas to create additional floodplain storage. In no case shall any required compensation be provided via bottom storage or by excavating below the elevation of the natural (pre-development) stream channel unless such excavation results from the widening or relocation of the stream channel; 
                  b.  Cut areas shall be stabilized and graded to a slope of no less than two (2.0) percent; 
                  c.  Effective transitions shall be provided such that flow velocities occurring on both upstream and downstream properties are not increased or decreased; 
                  d.  Verification of no-rise conditions (less than 0.01 foot), flood storage volumes, and flow characteristics shall be provided via a step-backwater analysis meeting the requirements of subsection 7.5-154(d); 
                  e.  Public utilities and facilities, such as water, sanitary sewer, gas, and electrical systems, shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate infiltration or contamination from floodwaters; and 
                  f.  Any significant physical changes to the base flood floodplain shall be submitted as a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) or conditional letter of map amendment (CLOMA), whichever is applicable. The CLOMR submittal shall be subject to approval by the City of Cartersville using the FEMA community concurrence forms before forwarding the submittal package to FEMA for final approval. The responsibility for forwarding the CLOMR to FEMA and for obtaining the CLOMR approval shall be the responsibility of the applicant. Within six (6) months of the completion of development, the applicant shall submit as-built surveys and plans for a final letter of map revision (LOMR). 
                  (d)  Engineering study requirements for floodplain encroachments. An engineering study is required, as appropriate to the proposed development activities on the site, whenever a development proposes to disturb any land within the future-conditions floodplain, except for a residential single-lot development on streams without established base flood elevations and floodways. This study shall be prepared by a licensed professional engineer and made a part of the application for a permit. This information shall be submitted to and approved by the City of Cartersville prior to the approval of any permit which would authorize the disturbance of land located within the future-conditions floodplain. Such study shall include: 
                  (1)  Description of the extent to which any watercourse or floodplain will be altered or relocated as a result of the proposed development; 
                  (2)  Step-backwater analysis, using a FEMA-approved methodology approved by the City of Cartersville. Cross-sections (which may be supplemented by the applicant) and flow information will be obtained whenever available. Computations will be shown duplicating FIS results and will then be rerun with the proposed modifications to determine the new base flood profiles, and future-conditions flood profiles; 
                  (3)  Floodplain storage calculations based on cross-sections (at least one (1) every one hundred (100) feet) showing existing and proposed floodplain conditions to show that base flood floodplain and future-conditions floodplain storage capacity would not be diminished by the development; 
                  (4)  The study shall include a preliminary plat, grading plan, or site plan, as appropriate, which shall clearly define all future-conditions floodplain encroachments; 
                  (5)  Detailed flood studies in areas where floodplain has been established but the base flood elevation (BFE) and/or the floodway has not been established and in areas beyond the limits of study on the FIRM, which may contain a watercourse, and have greater than one hundred (100) acres of surface drainage area above the property, shall be submitted showing the base flood elevations, future-conditions flood elevations, and the floodway. Approval of the study must be received before the final plat of the affected lots can be approved or a certificate of occupancy can be issued. 
                  (e)  Floodway encroachments. Located within areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, floodways must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  (1)  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway, except for activities specifically allowed in subsection (e)(2) below; 
                  (2)  Encroachments for bridges, culverts, roadways and utilities within the regulatory floodway may be permitted provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment will not result in any increase to the pre-project base flood elevations, floodway elevations, or floodway widths during the base flood discharge. A licensed professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof; and 
                  (3)  If the applicant proposes to revise the floodway boundaries, no permit authorizing the encroachment into or an alteration of the floodway shall be issued by the City of Cartersville until an affirmative conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) is issued by FEMA or a no-rise certification is approved by the City of Cartersville. 
                  (f)  Maintenance requirements. The property owner shall be responsible for continuing maintenance as may be needed within an altered or relocated portion of a floodplain on the property so that the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity is maintained. The City of Cartersville may direct the property owner (at no cost to City of Cartersville) to restore the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity of the floodplain if the owner has not performed maintenance as required by the approved floodplain management plan on file with the City of Cartersville. 
                  (Ord. No. 04-15, § 1, 3-5-15) 
                  Sec. 7.5-155. - Provisions for flood damage reduction.

All new construction and substantial improvements that include any fully enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater. 
                  a.  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a licensed professional engineer or architect to meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 
                  1.  Provide a minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
                  2.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot above grade; and 
                  3.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both directions. 
                  b.  So as not to violate the "lowest floor" criteria of this article, the unfinished and flood-resistant enclosure shall solely be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area; and 
                  c.  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be finished or partitioned into separate rooms. 
                  (6)  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located three (3) feet above the base flood elevation or one (1) foot above the future-conditions flood elevation, whichever is higher, so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding; 
                  (7)  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse and lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces; 
                  (8)  All proposed development shall include adequate drainage and stormwater management facilities per the requirements of City of Cartersville to reduce exposure to flood hazards; 
                  (9)  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system; 
                  (10)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters; 
                  (11)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to, or contamination from, such systems during flooding; 
                  (12)  Other public utilities such as gas and electric systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them, or public safety hazards from them, during flooding; 
                  (13)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure which is not compliant with the provisions of this article, shall be undertaken only if the nonconformity is not furthered, extended or replaced; 
                  (14)  If the proposed development is located in multiple flood zones, or multiple base flood elevations cross the proposed site, the higher or more restrictive base flood elevation or future condition elevation and development standards shall take precedence; 
                  (15)  When only a portion of a proposed structure is located within a flood zone or the future-conditions floodplain, the entire structure shall meet the requirements of this article; and 
                  (16)  Subdivision proposals and other proposed new development, including manufactured home parks or subdivisions, shall be reasonably safe from flooding: 
                  a.  All such proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage within the flood-prone area; 
                  b.  All public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage; and 
                  c.  Adequate drainage shall be provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
                  (b)  Building standards for structures and buildings within the future-conditions floodplain. 
                  (1)  Residential buildings. 
                  a.  New construction. New construction of principal residential structures shall not be allowed within the limits of the future-conditions floodplain unless all requirements of subsections 7.5-154(c), (d) and (e) have been met.

                  (4)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure, and the variance issued shall be the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (5)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this section are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (6)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (7)  In reviewing such requests, the City of Cartersville and the BZA shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article. 
                  (8)  Conditions for variances: 
                  a.  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  1.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
                  2.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and

                  Sec. 7.5-184. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices. 
                  (a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the ordinance and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of this section. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit. 
                  (b)  Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
                  (1)  Best management practices as set forth in subsections (b) and (c) of this section shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with subsection (b)(2) of this section or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
                  (2)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than twenty-five (25) nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten (10) nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five (5) acres. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
                  (5)  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsections (c)(15), (16), (17), and (18) of this section, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
                  (c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq., for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia, published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  (7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in runoff water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection 7.5-184(b)(2) of this article; 
                  (15)  Except as provided in subsections (c)(16) and (17) of this section, there is established a twenty-five-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or where bulkheads and sea walls are installed to prevent shoreline erosion on Lake Oconee and Lake Sinclair; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the groundwater table year-round; for which groundwater is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least twenty-five (25) feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within twenty-five (25) degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than fifty (50) feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (16)  There is established a fifty-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of twenty-five (25) gallons per minute or less shall have a twenty-five-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within twenty-five (25) degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than fifty (50) feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (17)  There is established a twenty-five-foot buffer along coastal marshlands, as measured horizontally from the coastal marshland-upland interface, as determined in accordance with O.C.G.A. tit. 12, ch. 5, the "Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1970," and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where an alteration within the buffer area has been authorized pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-286, for maintenance of any currently serviceable structure, landscaping, or hardscaping, including bridges, roads, parking lots, golf courses, golf cart paths, retaining walls, bulkheads, and patios; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, where a drainage structure or roadway drainage structure is constructed or maintained; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, on the landward side of any currently serviceable shoreline stabilization structure, or for the maintenance of any manmade stormwater detention basin, golf course pond, or impoundment that is located entirely within the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. For the purposes of this paragraph, maintenance shall be defined as actions necessary or appropriate for retaining or restoring a currently serviceable improvement to the specified operable condition to achieve its maximum useful life. Maintenance includes emergency reconstruction of recently damaged parts of a currently serviceable structure so long as it occurs within a reasonable period of time after damage occurs. Maintenance does not include any modification that changes the character, scope or size of the original design and serviceable shall be defined as usable in its current state or with minor maintenance but not so degraded as to essentially require reconstruction. 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to crossings for utility lines that cause a width of disturbance of not more than fifty (50) feet within the buffer; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
                  c.  The buffer shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity conducted pursuant to and in compliance with a valid and effective land-disturbing permit issued subsequent to April 22, 2014, and prior to December 31, 2015; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented or any lot for which the preliminary plat has been approved prior to December 31, 2015 if roadways, bridges, or water and sewer lines have been extended to such lot prior to the effective date of this Act and if the requirement to maintain a twenty-five-foot buffer would consume at least eighteen (18) percent of the high ground of the platted lot otherwise available for development; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented.

If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
                  (3)  Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this article, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
                  (4)  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
                  (5)  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this article.

The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to have forfeited his performance bond, if required to post one under the provisions of subsection 7.5-185(b)(6). The local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. 
                  (d)  Monetary penalties. Any person who violates any provisions of this article, or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant to this article, or who negligently or intentionally fails or refuses to comply with any final or emergency order of the director issued as provided in this article, shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) per day.

                  ARTICLE IX. - POST-DEVELOPMENT STORMWATER MANAGEMENT FOR NEW DEVELOPMENT AND REDEVELOPMENT 

                  Sec. 7.5-221. - Introduction. 
                  It is hereby determined that: 
                  Land development projects and other land use conversions, and their associated changes to land cover, permanently alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, which in turn increase flooding, stream channel erosion, and sediment transport and deposition. 
                  Land development projects and other land use conversions also contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters. 
                  The impacts of post-development stormwater runoff quantity and quality can adversely affect public safety, public and private property, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters. 
                  These adverse impacts can be controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff quantity and quality from new development and redevelopment, by the use of both structural facilities as well as nonstructural measures, such as the conservation of open space and greenspace areas. The preservation and protection of natural area and greenspace for stormwater management benefits is encouraged through the use of incentives or "credits." The Georgia Greenspace Program provides a mechanism for the preservation and coordination of those greenspace areas which provide stormwater management quality and quantity benefits. 
                  Localities in the State of Georgia are required to comply with a number of both state and federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of post-development stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution. 
                  Therefore, the City of Cartersville has established this set of stormwater management policies to provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of post-development stormwater runoff for the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation. It has determined that it is in the public interest to regulate post-development stormwater runoff discharges in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes, post-construction soil erosion and sedimentation, stream channel erosion, and nonpoint source pollution associated with post-development stormwater runoff.

                  Sec. 7.5-225. - Post-development stormwater management performance criteria. 
                  The following performance criteria shall be applicable to all stormwater management plans, unless otherwise provided for in this article: 
                  (1)  Water quality. All stormwater runoff generated from a site shall be adequately treated before discharge. It will be presumed that a stormwater management system complies with this requirement if: 
                  a.  It is sized to treat the prescribed water quality treatment volume from the site, as defined in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual; 
                  b.  Appropriate structural stormwater controls or nonstructural practices are selected, designed, constructed or preserved, and maintained according to the specific criteria in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual; and 
                  c.  Runoff from hotspot land uses and activities identified by the City of Cartersville are adequately treated and addressed through the use of appropriate structural stormwater controls, nonstructural practices and pollution prevention practices. 
                  (2)  Stream channel protection. Protection of stream channels from bank and bed erosion and degradation shall be provided by using all of the following three (3) approaches: 
                  a.  Preservation, restoration and/or reforestation (with native vegetation) of the applicable stream buffer; 
                  b.  Twenty-four-hour extended detention storage of the one-year, twenty-four-hour return frequency storm event; 
                  (This requirement may be adjusted or waived by the City of Cartersville for sites that discharge directly into larger streams, rivers, wetlands, or lakes, or to a manmade channel or conveyance system where the reduction in these flows will not have an impact on upstream or downstream stream bank or channel integrity.) 
                  c.  Erosion prevention measures such as energy dissipation and velocity control. 
                  (3)  Overbank flooding protection. Downstream overbank flood and property protection shall be provided by controlling (attenuating) the post-development peak discharge rate to the pre-development rate for the twenty-five-year, twenty-four-hour return frequency storm event. If control of the one-year, twenty-four-hour storm under section 7.5-225(2)b. is exempted, then peak discharge rate attenuation of the two-year through the twenty-five-year return frequency storm event must be provided. (This requirement may be adjusted or waived by the City of Cartersville for sites where the post-development downstream analysis shows that uncontrolled post-development conditions will not increase downstream peak flows, or that meeting the requirement will cause greater peak flow downstream impacts than the uncontrolled post-development conditions.) 
                  (4)  Extreme flooding protection. Extreme flood and public safety protection shall be provided by controlling and safely conveying the one hundred-year, twenty-four-hour return frequency storm event such that flooding is not exacerbated. (This requirement may be adjusted or waived by the City of Cartersville for sites where the post-development downstream analysis shows that uncontrolled post-development conditions will not increase downstream peak flows, or that meeting the requirement will cause greater peak flow downstream impacts than the uncontrolled post-development conditions.) 
                  (5)  Structural stormwater controls. All structural stormwater management facilities shall be selected and designed using the appropriate criteria from the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. All structural stormwater controls must be designed appropriately to meet their intended function. For other structural stormwater controls not included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual, or for which pollutant removal rates have not been provided, the effectiveness and pollutant removal of the structural control must be documented through prior studies, literature reviews, or other means and receive approval from City of Cartersville before being included in the design of a stormwater management system. In addition, if hydrologic or topographic conditions, or land use activities warrant greater control than that provided by the minimum control requirements, the City of Cartersville may impose additional requirements deemed necessary to protect upstream and downstream properties and aquatic resources from damage due to increased volume, frequency, and rate of stormwater runoff or increased nonpoint source pollution loads created on the site in question. 
                  Applicants shall consult the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual for guidance on the factors that determine site design feasibility when selecting and locating a structural stormwater control. 
                  (6)  Stormwater credits for nonstructural measures. The use of one (1) or more site design measures by the applicant may allow for a reduction in the water quality treatment volume required under section 7.5-225(1). The applicant may, if approved by the City of Cartersville, take credit for the use of stormwater better site design practices and reduce the water quality volume requirement. For each potential credit, there is a minimum set of criteria and requirements which identify the conditions or circumstances under which the credit may be applied. The site design practices that qualify for this credit and the criteria and procedures for applying and calculating the credits are included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. 
                  (7)  Drainage system guidelines. Stormwater conveyance facilities, which may include but are not limited to culverts, stormwater drainage pipes, catch basins, drop inlets, junction boxes, headwalls, gutter, swales, channels, ditches, and energy dissipaters shall be provided when necessary for the protection of public right-of-way and private properties adjoining project sites and/or public rights-of-way. Stormwater conveyance facilities that are designed to carry runoff from more that one (1) parcel, existing or proposed, shall meet the following requirements: 
                  a.  Methods to calculate stormwater flows shall be in accordance with the stormwater design manual; 
                  b.  All culverts, pipe systems and open channel flow systems shall be sized in accordance with the stormwater management plan using the methods included in the stormwater design manual; and 
                  c.  Design and construction of stormwater conveyance facilities shall be in accordance with the criteria and specifications found in the stormwater design manual. 
                  (8)  Dam design guidelines. Any land disturbing activity that involves a site which proposes a dam shall comply with the Georgia Safe Dams Act and Rules for Dam Safety as applicable.

                  (2)  Whether construction is in compliance with the approved stormwater management plan; 
                  (3)  Variations from the approved construction specifications; and 
                  (4)  Any other variations or violations of the conditions of the approved stormwater management plan. 
                  If any violations are found, the applicant shall be notified in writing of the nature of the violation and the required corrective actions. 
                  (b)  Final inspection and as built plans. Upon completion of a project, and before a certificate of occupancy shall be granted, the applicant is responsible for certifying that the completed project is in accordance with the approved stormwater management plan. All applicants are required to submit actual "as built" plans for any stormwater management facilities or practices after final construction are completed. The plan must show the final design specifications for all stormwater management facilities and practices and must be certified by a professional engineer. A final inspection by the City of Cartersville is required before the release of any performance securities can occur.

                  ARTICLE X. - MODEL ILLICIT DISCHARGE AND ILLEGAL CONNECTION 

                  Sec. 7.5-241. - Introduction. 
                  It is hereby determined that: 
                  Discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system that are not composed entirely of stormwater runoff contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters. 
                  These non-stormwater discharges occur due to spills, dumping and improper connections to the municipal separate storm sewer system from residential, industrial, commercial or institutional establishments. 
                  These non-stormwater discharges not only impact waterways individually, but geographically dispersed, small volume non-stormwater discharges can have cumulative impacts on receiving waters. 
                  The impacts of these discharges adversely affect public health and safety, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters. 
                  These impacts can be minimized through the regulation of spills, dumping and discharges into the municipal separate storm sewer system. 
                  Localities in the State of Georgia are required to comply with a number of state and federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution due to improper non-stormwater discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system. 
                  Therefore, the City of Cartersville adopts this article to prohibit such non-stormwater discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system. It is determined that the regulation of spills, improper dumping and discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety, and the environment.

                  Sec. 7.5-242. - General provisions. 
                  (a)  Purpose and intent. The purpose of this article is to protect the public health, safety, environment and general welfare through the regulation of non-stormwater discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system to the maximum extent practicable as required by federal law. This article establishes methods for controlling the introduction of pollutants into the municipal separate storm sewer system in order to comply with requirements of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit process. The objectives of this article are to: 
                  (1)  Regulate the contribution of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system by any person; 
                  (2)  Prohibit illicit discharges and illegal connections to the municipal separate storm sewer system; 
                  (3)  Prevent non-stormwater discharges, generated as a result of spills, inappropriate dumping or disposal, to the municipal separate storm sewer system; and 
                  (4)  To establish legal authority to carry out all inspection, surveillance, monitoring and enforcement procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this article. 
                  (b)  Applicability. The provisions of this article shall apply throughout the corporate limits of the City of Cartersville. 
                  (c)  Compatibility with other regulations. This article is not intended to modify or repeal any other ordinance, rule, regulation, other provision of law. The requirements of this article are in addition to the requirements of any other ordinance, rule, regulation, or other provision of law, and where any provision of this article imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation, or other provision of law, whichever provision is more restrictive or imposes higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall control. 
                  (d)  Severability. If the provisions of any section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this article shall be adjudged invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such judgment shall not affect or invalidate the remainder of any section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this article. 
                  (e)  Responsibility for administration. The City of Cartersville shall administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of this article. The city manager shall designate the administrator of this article.

                  CARTERSVILLE  HISTORIC PRESERVATION COMMISSION  DOWNTOWN BUSINESS DISTRICT 
                  GENERAL GUIDELINES 
                  PART ONE 
                  GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR STRUCTURES CONTRIBUTING TO THE HISTORIC DOWNTOWN BUSINESS DISTRICT 
                  Preservation of character-defining elements of historic buildings is a priority, and alterations and repairs should accurately represent the historic qualities of the buildings. Original documentation should be used for restoration work wherever possible. Where original documentation is unavailable, interpretations of similar elements that occurred in the area may be considered. 
                  In filing for a certificate of appropriateness all requirements must be complied with and so indicated on said application. Recommendations as indicated herein may or may not be included in your application for a COA. Maintenance recommendations are included for informational purposes only and are not to be included in an application for COA, and as such shall not be considered by the commission in reviewing said applications. 
                  1.  Changes in use: 
                  Recommendation: 
                  A change in use is not regulated, but every reasonable effort should be made to provide a compatible use for the building that will require minimal alteration to the building and its site. 
                  2.  Original design character: 
                  Requirement: 
                  Respect the original design character of the building. Analyze the building to determine which elements are essential to its character. Do not try to make the building appear older or younger in style than it really is. The genuine heritage of the Historic Downtown Business District should be expressed. 
                  3.  Historical changes: 
                  Requirement: 
                  Preserve older alterations that have achieved historic significance in themselves. Examples would be an addition or entryway that was added to the original building early in its history. More recent alterations that are not historically significant may be removed. 
                  4.  Plan and implement strategies: 
                  Requirement: 
                  Evaluate the historic property and establish a plan for implementing strategies for preservation, rehabilitation, restoration, reconstruction, alterations to the exterior, and additions. 
                  Rehabilitation work should not destroy the distinguishing character of the property or its environment. Match the original material when feasible. A substitute material is acceptable if the form and design of the substitute conveys the visual appearance of the original. 
                  Deteriorated architectural features should be repaired rather than replaced whenever possible. Patch, piece-in, splice, consolidate, or otherwise upgrade the existing material using recognized preservation methods whenever possible. If alternative materials must be used, they should match the original in appearance as closely as possible. 
                  Replacement of missing architectural elements should be based on accurate duplications of original features. In the event replacement is necessary, the new material should match that being replaced in design, color, texture, and other physical qualities. The design should be substantiated by physical or pictorial evidence. 
                  Where reconstruction of an element is impossible because of lack of historical evidence, a new design that relates to the building in general size, scale and material may be considered using design elements that reflect the building's style. 
                  During repair or rehabilitation, protect and maintain historic features that survive in generally good condition. Treatments include rust removal, caulking, sealing and repainting. Original materials and details that contribute to the historic significance of the structure should be preserved whenever feasible. 
                  When disassembly of an historic element is necessary for its rehabilitation, use methods that minimize damage to the original materials. Always devise methods of replacing the disassembled materials in their original configuration. 
                  5.  Roofs: 
                  Requirement: 
                  Preserve original pitch and shape of the roof forms where they contribute to the historic character of the building. Do not use shingled mansard roofs. Replace existing roof materials with the same type of material where it is visible from the street. Rooftop mechanical systems, satellite dishes, and microwave dishes should be unobtrusive and out of public view when possible. 
                  Maintain historic chimneys. Preserve historic skylights whenever possible. Do not remove ornamental roof features. 
                  6.  Cornices: 
                  A cornice is the decorative strip along the top of most historic commercial buildings. It caps off the facade physically and visually. Cornices are usually constructed of brick, wood, cast iron, or sheet metal, and occasionally the horizontal supporting beam itself ads as a cornice. 
                  Requirement: 
                  Whenever possible, the original cornice should be preserved. Damaged cornices should be repaired without disturbing the rest of the cornice, using similar materials. 
                  7.  Upper fronts: 
                  Requirement: 
                  The upper front of a building is the section of the facade above the main storefront to assist in making a business look alive, upper floors should appear occupied. Do not fill in upper windows. 
                  A second story addition must be in keeping with the historical architecture of the building. Do not construct a front porch or balcony where none existed before. 
                  8.  Facades: 
                  The basic commercial facade consists of two (2) main parts: the storefront with an entrance and display windows; and the upper front, usually with regularly spaced windows and a cornice at top of the building. The storefront and upper front are visually important. 
                  Requirement: 
                  The elements of the facade should be retained as closely as possible to those of the original structure, using existing original materials whenever possible. 
                  If parts of the facade are missing, design and reconstruction should be based on historical, pictorial, or physical documentation. When documentation is unavailable, a new design for a missing element should be compatible with the size, scale, and material of the historic building. 
                  9.  Exteriors: 
                  Requirement: 
                  Do not paint, coat, or waterproof unpainted masonry. Do not sandblast exterior surfaces. Use the gentlest means possible to clean exterior materials. 
                  When repainting brick, use historic mortar mix (softer than modern mixes), matching the original mortar joints. The Stein Building on West Main Street is a good example of this process. 
                  Maintain historic exterior materials. Repair, as part of renovation, damaged exterior materials with like materials- and only in the area of damage. Do not use imitation brick or stone, wood or metal siding, or aggregates on the building facade. 
                  Recommendation: 
                  Maintain historic exterior materials. Repair, as part of maintenance, damaged exterior materials with like materials and only in the area of damage. Do not use imitation brick or stone, wood or metal siding, or aggregates on the building facade. 
                  10.  Storefronts: 
                  Common historic storefront design consists of large, thinly framed windows and a recessed entrance. Frequently there is a cornice at the top of the storefront to separate it from the upper facade, and low bulkheads at the base of the storefront to protect the windows and define the entrance. 
                  Requirement: 
                  Historic storefronts should be repaired rather than replaced or covered. Retain original elements, such as bulkheads or cast iron columns. Storefronts can consist of a variety of materials, but the overall image should be simple and unobtrusive, using materials similar to those of the rest of the building. If replacement of elements is required new materials should match the original in placement, composition, design, texture and other visual qualities. The frame can be wood, cast iron, or anodized aluminum. Bulkheads are generally wood panels, aluminum-clad plywood, polished stone, glass, or tile. 
                  Where the original storefront no longer exists, replacement should be based on historical research and physical evidence and be compatible with nearby historic building. Do not extend the storefront out of its place in the facade. It should be in the same plane as the upper facade and not extend beyond the original opening. 
                  Retain transom windows, reopening previously covered transoms whenever possible. Do not enclose, replace the window type, cover, or install air-conditioning units in transom windows. 
                  11.  Exterior details: 
                  Requirement: 
                  Details can be some of the most striking elements of a building's facade. Since the design and size of many commercial buildings are quite similar, their unique decorations should be noted and preserved. 
                  Subtle wood details, as in window moldings should be retained. Do not add architectural details where none existed before, such as colonial doors, small windowpanes, or storefront shutters. 
                  Decorative tile should be retained, as should structural or pigmented glass such as beveled, stained, leaded, and etched glass, where they contribute to the original historic value. 
                  During repair, renovation or rehabilitation, all decorative terra cotta and all forms of brick work and stonework should be repaired and maintained. Cast iron and sheet metal decorations, common on many nineteenth century buildings, should be preserved. 
                  Recommendation: 
                  Decorative terra cotta and all forms of brickwork and stonework should be repaired and maintained. 
                  12.  Windows—Storefront: 
                  Requirement: 
                  Retain the large display windows characteristic of commercial buildings in their original size, shape, and proportions, and use original materials whenever possible. Preserve original window components, replacing only damaged portions. When replacing glass or restoring windows, retain the original size and shape of the storefront opening. 
                  Display windows should use clear glass only; transom windows can be clear, tinted or stained. Neither should have dividing mulls. 
                  Restore previously enclosed display windows when the original design is documented. 
                  Do not fill in window spaces or add storm windows which obscure the historic windows. If dropped ceilings cover part of the window openings, have the drop setback so the entire window space appears open from the outside. Interior window treatments should not change the overall character of the windows. Do not add merely decorative exterior shutters that do not fit the windows. 
                  Recommendation: 
                  Traditional storefronts are composed almost entirely of glass, allowing natural lights to enter what is typically a long and narrow space that contains no other windows. This storefront attracts business and should be well maintained. 
                  13.  Windows—Upper front: 
                  Requirement: 
                  Existing windows should be repaired whenever possible, using similar materials. If required, replacement windows should match the original in materials, configuration, and style, and fill the entire opening. If aluminum frame is used, paint it to match the remaining windows. Storm windows should be either mounted inside or painted to match the window sash. 
                  Recommendation: 
                  Upper story windows help tie together all the facades on a street. They give a building the appearance of vitality and should not be filled in or covered over. If the space is vacant, appropriate shades, curtains or other interior window treatments should be used. 
                  14.  Awnings and canopies: 
                  The canvas awning was an important design element common in the traditional storefront. They help shelter passersby, reduce glare, and conserve energy by controlling the amount of sunlight that hits the store windows. Movable awnings can be retracted allowing the sun to shine into your building in the winter and can be extended to shade the storefront from summer heat. Awnings can also effectively and tactfully disguise inappropriate storefront alterations. 
                  Requirement: 
                  There are a variety of materials for awnings, including canvas, vinyl-coated canvas, and the synthetic material carillon. Standard street-level awnings should be mounted between the display windows and the first-floor cornice or sign panel with the valance about seven (7) feet above the sidewalk. They should reinforce the frame of the storefront without covering up the side piers, and should project four (4) to seven (7) feet from the building. A twelve-inch valance flap is usually attached at the awning bar and can serve as a sign panel. 
                  Canopies, however, especially large ones that are an integral part of the building, may still be intact and should be preserved. Smaller canopies may benefit from the addition of a canvas over the rails, and a twelve- to twenty-four-inch skirt along the front and sides. 
                  Recommendation: 
                  Since the average life of an awning is between four (4) and seven (7) years, the only records of authentic awnings are old photographs or renderings, unless they have been maintained regularly through the years. Always check any old photographs available for awnings on your building. 
                  An awning can bring attention to your building but careful attention should be given to its design. Consider how it will appear in relation to the scale of your building to others on the street. An intelligently designed and placed awning can save you money, identify your storefront, and create a nice sidewalk area for customers. 
                  15.  Entrances: 
                  Requirement: 
                  Retain original recessed entries where they exist. Use building symmetry to suggest location, preferably recessed and canted. Retain tiled entryway floors. On upper levels, maintain historic door placements; do not add new entrances to secondary levels on the facade. 
                  Entrance doors on historical commercial buildings usually have a large clear glass panel and are made of wood, steel, or aluminum. When restoring, paint the frames a compatible color with the rest of the facade. Replacement doors should resemble the original in design and proportions. 
                  Retain doors, hardware, trim and the original number of doors and their locations. Do not install unfinished aluminum doors or residential doors. Do not add transoms or sidelights were none existed before. 
                  16.  Additions: 
                  Requirement: 
                  Additions should be placed away from public view at the rear of the building or well behind the facade. Maintain the form, orientation and symmetry of the original structure. 
                  Create a discernible break at the juncture with the original structure. Walls of the addition should not be flush with the original structure. Ideally, the addition should be able to be removed without substantial loss of historic materials and elements. 
                  Use matching or similar elements for style, roofing, siding, and windows. 
                  Requirement: 
                  Parking lots should not be the main focus of the front of the building. 
                  PART TWO 
                  GUIDELINES FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION IN HISTORIC  DOWNTOWN BUSINESS DISTRICT 
                  1.  Building form and scale: 
                  Requirements: 
                  Any new building constructed in the Historic Downtown Business District area will make a significant visual impact on the streetscape. It is important to consider the character and scale of the surroundings and adjacent buildings to insure the new structure will be compatible. New buildings should appear similar in mass and scale to historic structures in the area. Use building forms and roof forms that match those used historically. Any addition to an existing structure must also conform to the historic district. 
                  Building height should be comparable to adjacent structures. Where new building facades will be wider than those found traditionally, subdivide the surface into promotions similar in scale to historic fades by varying setback, roof forms, and materials. New construction should be sensitive to the size, scale, proportion, material, shape, texture, and rhythm of its neighbors. 
                  2.  Reconstruction: 
                  Requirements: 
                  Infill designs should not attempt to duplicate the period and style of the adjacent buildings, or try to look "old" by using period proportions and materials. The designs should complement the buildings in the area but represent the style of the period in which it is built. 
                  When a contemporary depiction is required to understand and interpret a property's historic value (including the recreation of missing components in a historic district or site); when no other property with the same associative value has survived; and when sufficient historical documentation exists to ensure an accurate reproduction, reconstruction may be considered as a treatment. 
                  3.  Building orientation and site-placement: 
                  Requirements: 
                  New buildings will respect the placement of nearby historic buildings by being placed at a setback equal to that of nearby similar historic buildings or similar buildings within the district. It is required to align new buildings with the established setbacks of the area. Nontraditional lots can be given special consideration by the HPC. 
                  Buildings with party walls, such as those along Wall Street, Main Street, Public Square, and East Church Street (under the bridge) shall maintain zero lot line placement. New buildings on these streets will not have side setbacks, leaving gaps between adjacent buildings, but will use party walls. 
                  4.  Entrance orientation: 
                  Requirement: 
                  New construction will face the same street as nearby similar buildings. Respect traditional designs used for building entrances of similar buildings in the district, using, for example, a recessed entrance where appropriate. 
                  5.  Windows: 
                  Requirement: 
                  The size and proportion of window and door openings of a building should be similar to those on surrounding exemplary facades. The same applies to the ratio of window area to solid wall for the facade as a whole. Maintain the rhythm of the surrounding windows. 
                  6.  Materials: 
                  Requirement: 
                  Use building materials that are similar to those employed historically for all major surfaces. Brick, stone and terra cotta may be used in unlimited quantities. 
                  Wood may be used on the first story (store-front level) for architectural elements such as pilasters, cornices, decorative raised panels, etc., but wood should not be used as a general siding material. 
                  Concrete block may be used in combination with other materials such as brick or stone. Concrete and precast concrete use is limited to architectural elements such as window hoods, cornices, columns and capitals. Glazed block or ceramic tile may be used as accent material only. 
                  Prohibited materials on building facades include metal, aluminum, or vinyl siding and preformed panels; porcelain or baked enamel metal panels; asphalt or wood shingles or siding. New materials may be used if their appearances are similar to those of the historic building materials. 
                  7.  Plant beds and plantings: 
                  Requirement: 
                  Landscaping plans shall be approved by the DDA design committee in keeping with the downtown master plan prior to submission of the COA to the historic preservation commission (HPC). 
                  Recommendation: 
                  The goal is to beautify the district and make it more pleasant for pedestrian traffic. Locate plantings in traditional areas of the site, such as along fences, walks, and foundations. Well-maintained concrete planters that harmonize with nearby buildings and existing streetscape are recommended. 
                  8.  Walls and fences: 
                  Requirement: 
                  The goal is to maintain the pattern of existing fencing in the Historic Downtown Business District and to use fencing and walls to screen parking and storage areas. Maintain traditional fence lines or dominant fence lines in the vicinity. New fence and wall designs must be appropriate for the primary structure and reinforce the pedestrian scale instead of forming barriers or exclusionary walls. 
                  Any fencing shall be approved by the DDA design committee in keeping with the downtown master plan prior to submission of the COA to the Historic Preservation Commission (HPC). 
                  Privacy fences should not be placed flush with the facade of a building. 
                  Recommendation: 
                  New fences should limit their impact by being placed behind the rear elevation and by using traditional materials, usually wood. Any obtrusive fence shall be further screened from public view by evergreen vegetation or a second traditional fence. 
                  9.  Pavement: 
                  Requirement: 
                  Historic walks and drives should be repaired rather than replaced. If replacement is required, new materials should match the original in placement, composition, design, color, texture and other visual qualities. 
                  10.  Parking lots: 
                  Requirement: 
                  Where placement of parking area is an option, parking lots should not be the main focus of the site. Side or rear locations are required. Plan parking lots to be subdivided into small components so that the visual impact of large paved areas is reduced. Include islands of plantings in the interior of lots, and provide planting buffers at the edges of parking lots. 
                  New screening walls shall be used to limit the impact of parking on the district by being of sufficient height to partially screen the parked vehicles. The facade line of nearby historic buildings should be maintained. Traditional materials. usually brick, should be used. Nontraditional materials cannot be used for fences in public view. (See also Walls and Fences.) 
                  11.  Service areas and equipment: 
                  Requirement: 
                  Screen service equipment and trash containers from public view. The visual impact of mechanical and electrical equipment shall be minimized. (See also walls and fences.) 
                  12.  Signs: 
                  Requirement: 
                  Signs shall be subordinate to the architecture and overall character throughout the district. Sign materials shall be compatible with the building materials. The types and sizes of signs allowed are defined in the sign ordinance of the City of Cartersville. 
                  Position flush-mounted signs so they will fit within architectural features. Locate flush signs so they do not extend beyond the outer edges of the building front. Avoid obscuring ornament and detail. 
                  Locate projecting signs along the first floor level of the facade. Positions near the building's entrance are encouraged. Locate pole-mounted signs in landscaped areas. 
                  Where several businesses share a building, coordinate the signs. Align several smaller signs, or group them onto a single panel. Use similar forms or backgrounds for the signs to visually tie them together. 
                  13.  Additions: 
                  Requirement: 
                  New additions should not obscure or confuse the essential form and character of the original building. Exteriors of additions to existing buildings should be compatible with the size, scale, material, and character of the main building and its environment. 
                  Avoid new additions that would hinder the ability to interpret the design character of the historic period of the district. Site additions back from the building front so they will not alter the historic rhythm of building fronts. 
                  When locating additions to historic buildings, maintain the pattern created by the repetition of building fronts in the area. Locate additions so they will not obscure or damage significant ornamentation or detail. Avoid impacts to special moldings, decorative windows, or dormers. Generally, additions should be sited to the side or rear of the original structure. 
                  14.  Demolition: 
                  Requirement: 
                  Before demolition, submit a site plan to the commission illustrating proposed site development or plantings to follow demolition. 
                  During demolition, ensure the safety of any adjacent properties and historic resources. Also, during and after demolition, protect the trees on the site from damage due to compaction of the soil by equipment or materials. 
                  After demolition, clear the site promptly and thoroughly. 
                  After demolition, plant or develop the site promptly as approved in the proposed site plan. 
                  (e)  Effective date. This district shall become effective on April 1, 2004.

An adjustment may result in a refund to the feepayor or payment of the marginal increase of the adjusted fee over the amount already paid. 
                  (e)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, any future change in demand for public facilities in excess of the average demand anticipated at the time of issuance of the building permit shall be assessed such additional fee as would otherwise have been due. Future changes in demand may result from a change in the land use category of the occupant of the building or property, the expansion of a building or use on a property that results in an increase in the units of development (as defined herein), or the subsequent discovery of facts unknown or misrepresented at the time of issuance of the building permit.

                  Sec. 9.75-56. - Exemption policy. 
                  The City Council of Cartersville finds that certain office, retail trade or industrial uses that create unusually high investment, economic or job creation benefits represent extraordinary economic development and employment growth of public benefit to Cartersville in proportion to the creation of such benefits. To encourage such development projects, the city council may consider granting a reduction in the impact fee for such a development project upon the determination and relative to the extent that the business or project represents extraordinary economic development and employment growth of public benefit to Cartersville, in accordance with adopted exemption criteria. It is also recognized that the cost of system improvements otherwise foregone through exemption of any impact fee must be funded through revenue sources other than impact fees.

                  (2)  Documentation must be provided to the administrator that demonstrates the applicant's eligibility for an exemption. This documentation shall address, but need not be limited to, all applicable exemption criteria adopted by the city. This documentation constitutes the application for exemption. 
                  (3)  The administrator in his or her sole discretion shall determine whether an application for exemption addresses the exemption criteria adopted by the city and is complete. A negative determination by the administrator may be appealed to the city council in accordance with the administrative appeals section of this chapter.

                  (3)  For any contribution of capital equipment that qualifies as a system improvement by a developer or his or her predecessor in title or interest and accepted by the city, the value shall be the original cost to the developer of the capital equipment or the cost that Cartersville, Georgia would normally pay for such equipment, whichever is less. 
                  (4)  For any contribution of money for system improvements from a developer or his or her predecessor in title or interest accepted by the city, the original value of the money shall be the same as that at the time of contribution, from which present value may be calculated.

                  --- (6) --- 
                  Editor's note— Ordinance No. 52-95, § I, adopted December 21, 1995, repealed §§ 10-301—10-335 in their entirety and added new §§ 10-301—10-334. Formerly, such sections pertained to similar provisions and derived from Ord. No. 13-91, 5-16-91. 

                  Sec. 10-301. - Purpose and findings. 
                  (a)  The purpose of this article is to regulate certain types of businesses, including, but not limited to, adult entertainment establishments, to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses will be curtailed. However it is recognized that such regulation cannot de facto approach prohibition. Otherwise, a protected form of expression would vanish. As to adult entertainment establishments, this article represents a balancing of competing interests; reduced criminal activity and protection of the neighbors through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments versus the protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons. 
                  (b)  Findings. Based on the experience of other urban counties and municipalities, including, but not limited to, Atlanta and Fulton County, Georgia; DeKalb County, Georgia; Richmond County, Georgia; Floyd County, Georgia; Amarillo, Texas; Austin, Texas; Garden Grove, California; Houston, Texas; Renton, Washington; Phoenix, Arizona; Indianapolis, Indiana; St. Paul, Minnesota; Tucson, Arizona; Augusta, Georgia; LaGrange, Georgia; Dalton and Whitfield County, Georgia; Carrollton, Georgia; Smyrna, Georgia; Rome, Georgia; and Ft. Lauderdale and Palm Beach, Florida, which experiences, we believe are relevant to the problems faced by the City of Cartersville, Georgia, the mayor and city council takes note of the notorious and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within our country. Moreover, it is the findings of the mayor and city council that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages, begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with nudity and alcohol are disorderly conduct, prostitution and drug trafficking and use. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with nudity and alcohol are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhood, increased expenditure for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described, and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas. Therefore, the limitation of nude conduct in establishments licensed in the city limits and prohibiting the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in said establishment is in the public welfare and it is a matter of governmental interest and concern to prevent the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which serve alcohol and also allow and/or encourage nudity. Based on these findings, this article is adopted to regulate certain types of businesses and to establish where such activity may or may not be conducted.

                  (Ord. No. 20-16, § 1, 10-6-16) 
                  Secs. 10-456—10-504. - Reserved. 
                  ARTICLE XIV. - MEDICAL, PHARMACY, PAIN MANAGEMENT ESTABLISHMENTS 

                  Sec. 10-505. - Purpose and findings. 
                  (a)  Since the 1990's, the abuse of prescription opioids has risen dramatically, due in large part to the increase in the use of these analgesics to manage pain. Opioids are prescribed to alleviate pain ranging from moderate to severe, as described by the patient. These analgesics principally affect the nervous system, suppressing the signlas of pain sent to the brain; examples of these medications can include, but not be limited to, morphine, codeine, oxycodone (e.g., OxyContin, Percodan, Percocet), and related drugs. As opioids "block the perception of pain" they also have the affect of creating a state of euphoria, which may be heightened when abused. Side effects can include drowsiness, nausea, constipation, and respiratory constraint. 
                  (b)  Opioids are recognized as very effective when taken as prescribed for legitimate pruposes, post surgery, for example. As the National Institute on Drug Abuse states, "Many studies have shown that the properly managed, short-term medical use of opioid analgesic drugs is safe and rarely causes addiction - defined as the compulsive and uncontrollable use of drugs despite adverse consequences - or dependence, which occurs when the body adapts to the presence of a drug, and often results in withdrawal symptoms when that drug is reduced or stopped." Unfortunately, opioids taken long-term can create physical dependency in some patients, producing withdrawal symptoms when the medication is not taken. Cessation side effects can include bone pain, insomnia, and vomiting, to name a few. 
                  (c)  Since the tragic events of September 11, 2001, the rise in the diversion of legal prescription drugs has grown exponentially, due to increased security at the borders and ports. Amplified security has effectively reduced the supply of illegal drugs, traditional smuggled by the drug trade, necessitating the need to find alternative methods of supplying drugs to users; consequently, legal prescription drugs are now being diverted to illegal uses - "diversion." These diverted drugs are Schedule II, III and IV drugs, which principally include opioids as well as complementary drugs. 
                  (d)  In recent years, South Florida, including Miam-Dade, Broward, and Palm Counties, have witnessed tremendous growth in the number of "pain clinics" that have opened in addition to the rapid increase of the diversion of prescription drugs. Broward County has been termed "The Painkiller Capital of the Unites States," and "The Columbia for Pharmaceutically Diverted Drugs." Broward County had four (4) pain clinics in 2007, jumping to one hundred fifteen (115) by November 2009, of a total of one hundred seventy-six (176) such clinics in all of South Florida. The majority of these pain clinics are nothing more than pill mills, diverting these scheduled drugs to illegal uses. As "clinics" have multiplied, the deaths due to overdoses of prescription drug medications, specifically opioids, have skyrocketed. 
                  (e)  With Broward County on the forefront of this epidemic, a grand jury was empanelled to investigate, issuing a report on November 19, 2009, after hearing testimony from prescription drug abusers and their families, federal and state law enforcement officials, physicians, prosecutors, and many more stakeholders. The report provides valuable information regarding the current state of this epidemic as well as recommendations to curtail this rapidly growing public safety concern. 
                  (f)  As Broward County and other South Florida jurisdictions struggle to eliminate "pill mills", this outbreak of illicit pain clinics crossed into other states, notably Georgia and Texas. In fact, the Cobb County Prescription Drug Task Force reports that in 2007, 82.46 percent overdose deaths state-wide involved pharmaceuticals, going to 85.11 percent in 2008. Alprazolam, Hydrocodone, and Oxycodone were found to constitute the top five (5) substances involved in all of these overdose deaths. Alprazolam, commonly known by the trade name Xanax, an anxiety medications, is often combined and distributed with opioids at illegal pain clinics. 
                  (g)  Illegal pain clinics commonly known as "pill mills" dispense large quantities of Schedule II, III and IV drugs for cash, with little examination of the patient conducted. Scheduled drugs are dispensed at these establishments or prescriptions are written to be filled at a legitimate pharmacy. Often, out of jurisdiction and out-of-state license plates are in the parking lots of these clinics, with individuals driving great distances to receive these "prescriptions." Pill mills often hire security guards to handle unruly patients and perhaps even scout for law enforcement. Individuals seeking these services will often fake an ailment, forging an MRI or providing falsified medical documentation to receive prescriptions. In turn, the physicians conduct lackadaisical examinations of these individuals, simply asking them "what they want" with regard to medication. 
                  (h)  The City of Cartersville City Council adopted a twelve-month moratorium on the issuance of occupational tax certificates to "pain management clinics" on April 21, 2011, to conduct the proper research and vetting to create a new ordinance and Municipal Code addressing "pill mills." After thorough research, the city council has prepared these provisions to eliminate this rapidly emerging epidemic, creating a new article in the Code of the City of Cartersville. 
                  (i)  Not all pain clinics are "pill mills," thus the challenge of regulating this epidemic is daunting. Pill mills could easily be found in establishments that provide physical therapy, chiropractics, or general medicine, through the "pain clinic" title is most commonly associated with such operation. Therefore, the city council finds that "pill mills," pose a current and real threat to the health, safety and welfare of the people of the City of Cartersville, and therefore make the following declarations: 
                  (1)  The "pill mill" has become a store front for the new illegal drug trade, as legitimate prescription medication is diverted for illicit purposes. 
                  (2)  "Pill mills" must be regulated and differentiated from legitimate healthcare providers, as they attempt to enter the Georgia market from Florida and other neighboring states which are beginning to adopt regulatory legislation. 
                  (3)  "Pill mills" are often owned, operated and staffed by unlicensed proprietors, with little or no medical training. 
                  (4)  "Pill mills" masquerade as legitimate pain management establishments or medical providers, but instead perform few, if any, medical examinations with often sparsely furnished offices and no typical medical equipment. 
                  (5)  "Pill mills" operate on a cash basis, usually not accepting checks, credit cards, or health insurance, creating an environment that poses a security threat in light of the clientele seeking these illicit services. 
                  (6)  Individuals seeking "pill mill" services often falsify symptoms or provide bogus documentation of an ailment to receive powerful Schedule II, III and IV drugs. Alternative methods of treatment, physical therapy, surgery, etc., are rarely ever proposed to a patient seeking services from a "pill mill". 
                  (7)  Individuals will often "shop" various "pill mills" receiving multiple prescriptions on the same day or during a short period of time, thereafter reselling the pills to generate a profit to fund their own addiction and purchase additional supplies. 
                  (8)  "Dealers" or groups of dealers often sponsor individuals who obtain Schedule II, III and IV drugs repeatedly over multiple "pill mills", during a short period of time. These large quantities may then be resold at a much higher value to fund the purchase of larger quantities as well as to continue the abuse of these powerful drugs by the individuals involved. 
                  (9)  Individuals seeking "pill mill" services will often be consuming these scheduled drugs as they search for the next pill mill. These individuals may be under the influence of one (1) or more of these powerful drugs or suffering from withdrawal symptoms. Pill mills can usually supply scheduled drugs on-site for individuals to consume immediately, as well. Both the influence of the scheduled drug as well as the debilitating withdrawal symptoms affecting a driver operating a motor vehicle in City of Cartersville while seeking a "pill mill" is of grave concern. 
                  (10)  Legitimate pain clinics should be owned, operated and staffed by licensed physicians, boarded in a pain management-related field recognized by the American Board of Medical Specialists.

                  (a)  While studies and research illustrate that "pill mills" more often than not pose as "pain clinics", this perception can be inaccurate. Many legitimate pain clinics operate daily throughout the state and nation, faithfully treating their patients with the highest ethical standards. Pill mills are capable of posing as urgent care clinics, family medical practices, and neighborhood pharmacies, for example. In fact, any medical "storefront" could operate as a pill mill.

Preliminary information will be gathered from proposed medical establishments and pharmacies to properly route the business through the applicable regulatory and zoning reviews, prior to the issuance of a occupational tax certificate. A questionnaire shall be provided to persons seeking to operate a medical establishment or pharmacy in the City of Cartersville ("applicant"), in conjunction with the completion of occupation tax certificate and zoning preclearance forms. 
                  (c)  The planning and development department and the police department are hereby directed to create a questionnaire for those seeking to operate a medical establishment or pharmacy in the City of Cartersville.

                  (1)  Detail services offered at the proposed medical establishment or pharmacy. 
                  (2)  If opening a pain clinic, please detail the methods of evaluation, treatment, and rehabilitation offered at the proposed establishment.

                  (5)  Do you intend to prescribe Schedule II, III or IV drugs at your proposed location? 
                  (6)  Do you intend to dispense Schedule II, III or IV drugs at your proposed location or on the premises?

                  (d)  Each applicant, representing a proposed medical establishment or pharmacy, shall in good faith complete this questionnaire, answering the questions to the best of their ability. Signatures of the applicant and establishment owner or corporate officer (if not the same as applicant) shall be required on the questionnaire, attesting that all answers and information provided are true and correct to the best of their knowledge. Deception, false statements, and misrepresentations on the questionnaire shall cause enforcement action and penalties against the entity as detailed under sections 10-519 and 10-521.

The city manager, police chief, or planning and development director may review each questionnaire to determine if a proposed business shall be classified as a medical establishment, pharmacy or pain clinic. The decision to classify a proposed business as a pain clinic is at the discretion of the city manager, police chief, or planning and development director, appealable to city council, as detailed under section 10-520.

                  2. The jurisdictions under this plan will respond to events utilizing the standardized unified incident command system recognized by the state to include the Incident Command System (ICS). ICS is a standardized on-scene incident management concept designed specifically to allow responders to adopt an integrated organizational structure equal to the complexity and demands of any single incident or multiple incidents without being hindered by jurisdictional boundaries. During events involving multiple jurisdictions or agencies, the principles of unified incident command have been universally incorporated into the National Incident Management System (NIMS). This unified incident command not only coordinates the efforts of many jurisdictions, but provides for and assures joint decisions on objectives, strategies, plans, priorities, and public communications.

                  (1)  The city is able to form a reasonable belief that the consumer report relates to the consumer about whom the city requested the report; 
                  (2)  The city establishes a continuing relation with the consumer; and 
                  (3)  The city regularly and in the ordinary course of business provides information to the consumer reporting agency from which it received the notice of address discrepancy. 
                  (b)  Such information shall be provided to the consumer reporting agency as part of the information regularly provided by the city to such agency for the reporting period in which the city establishes a relationship with the customer.

                  Sec. 12-105. - Public meeting. 
                  (a)  For all study areas that meet the previous requirements, a public meeting shall be held at which a representative of the public works department shall be present and take minutes for presentation to city council. Public meetings are held in order to provide speed table study area residents with relevant information prior to city council public hearings/readings. 
                  (b)  Prior to public meetings, public works shall mark the proposed speed table location(s) on the residential street(s) within three (3) feet of the final location(s) and shall subsequently verify that the resident(s) of property fronting the speed table location(s) agree with the proposed location(s). In the event that no suitable speed table location(s) can be agreed upon by public works and the resident(s) fronting the location(s), the matter will be brought forward to council for consideration prior to further action. 
                  (c)  Notices of the public meetings will be posted a minimum of fourteen (14) days prior to each meeting. Signs advertising the public meeting(s) will be provided and installed by the City of Cartersville Public Works Department. Signs will be clearly legible to traffic traveling in each direction near each end of the road section being considered for speed tables. Public meetings consist of a short presentation, followed by a question and comment session. The purpose of the public meeting is to provide reasonable accommodation for input from residents and others that may use the residential street(s) to access their lots. 
                  (d)  Emergency service providers (police, fire and ambulance) will be requested to provide information to the council related to the effects of installing speed tables in the requested study area.

                  Sec. 12-107. - Speed table design standards. 
                  The geometric design of speed tables is a crucial factor in their effectiveness. City of Cartersville speed tables will be constructed per the following specifications: 
                  (1)  Vertical height. Three (3) inches. A tolerance for minor height differences due to construction variations may be permitted. 
                  (2)  Horizontal length. Twenty-two (22) feet (consisting of an incline of six (6) feet; a plateau of ten (10) feet in length; and a decline of six (6) feet). 
                  (3)  Spacing/placement. In order to be effective, speed tables are typically installed in a series. Spacing between tables will vary between a minimum spacing of three hundred (300) feet and a maximum spacing of eight hundred (800) feet or as recommended by public works. Minor changes in the proposed speed table location up to three (3) feet may be considering prior to installation of the speed tables based upon resident concerns and the engineering feasibility to make such modifications. 
                  (4)  Signs/pavement markings. Speed tables will be identified in accordance with signing and pavement marking standards in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, latest edition. In cases where special safety circumstances exist, public works may authorize signing and pavement marking exceeding the minimum standards set forth in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices.

                  Sec. 12-108. - Installation of speed tables. 
                  The property owners requesting the permanent traffic control devices will be responsible for the costs of the measures. Installation of speed tables will be performed by either a private contractor, contracted by the City of Cartersville, or by city forces. Installation of speed tables will not be considered final until the City of Cartersville Public Works Department inspects the tables for compliance with design standards set forth in this article.

Once the requestor has been verified as a resident of the affected street(s), a notice of public hearing shall be posted. Notice of public hearing may follow the procedures in use at the time for providing notice for rezoning matters. After the conclusion of the public hearing, the city council may then vote to approve/disapprove removal of speed tables in the study using the procedure provided for to approve amendments to ordinances. 
                  (b)  Speed tables will not be removed unless approved by the city council. City of Cartersville reserves the right to remove speed tables for any reason.

Once a written variance request is filed with the city, the city shall hold a public hearing to determine whether the variance should be granted. Notice of variance hearings shall follow the procedures in use at the time for providing notice for rezoning matters. After the conclusion of the variance hearing, the city council may then vote to approve/disapprove installation of speed tables in the study at its sole discretion, following the procedure for amendments to ordinances.

                  The mayor and city council of the City of Cartersville, Georgia finds and determines that graffiti is a public nuisance and destructive of the rights and values of property owners as well as the entire community. Graffiti promotes blight in the neighborhoods in which it occurs and encourages similar acts of vandalism. Without prompt and immediate removal of graffiti, other properties become the target of graffiti and entire neighborhoods are affected and become less desirable places in which to be, all to the detriment of the city and its citizens. 
                  The mayor and city council of the City of Cartersville, Georgia, in the interest of public health, safety and welfare further finds and declares that to be truly effective in the deterrence, eradication and removal of graffiti, it is necessary to implement a comprehensive anti-graffiti ordinance.

                  Sec. 15-38. - Duties. 
                  (a)  In general. Board members must recognize that their responsibilities are as an "advisory board" only. The board's composition will consist of a varied range of individuals, with a different interest of recreational activities and/or facilities, the input received and recommended will be highly considered by the city council, city manager and the parks and recreation director when determining policies and goals for the department of parks and recreation. Board members must recognize that their job is to advise in determining goals and policies, not to administer them. They do not use their position for political, financial, or personal advantage. They recognize their trusteeship and devote their time needed to learn their job and to carry out their responsibilities. They do not assume the functions of the director by attempting to dictate how details shall be carried out, by interfering with employment procedures, or by dealing directly in an executive capacity with subordinate workers. A sound principle in board executive relationships is to let the director organize, conduct and direct the affairs of the department, as long as his/her efforts produce the desired results deemed appropriate by the city council. 
                  (b)  Guidelines. 
                  (1)  The principal function of the advisory board is to advise and make recommendations to the city council, city manager and director of parks and recreation that helps the City of Cartersville meet the recreational/leisure needs of the citizens. 
                  (2)  No committee or individual board member has any authority unless such authority is specifically granted to him/her by the city council. 
                  (3)  Board members shall deal officially with the recreation staff only through the director. 
                  (4)  The board must be careful not to permit their judgment to be influenced by pressures adverse to the best interests of the parks and recreation department and all citizens of Cartersville. They must always bear in mind that all parks and recreation facilities and programs are to be utilized for and in the best interest of the entire citizenry and not for a select group. 
                  (5)  Board members are guides and counselors. They study the broader phases of operation leaving to the director all administrative details. They should, whenever possible, avail themselves to the director when requested to give counsel or advice in problems concerning the department. 
                  (6)  Board members should always insist upon the maintenance of the highest standards. 
                  (7)  Board members should, when requested to do so, be willing to represent and speak for the department at official occasions. Members are often called upon to act as spokesmen for departments in other cities at public ceremonies, public hearings on problems concerning the department, and conferences at which recreation programs and policies are under discussion. 
                  (8)  The board will be able to make changes, add to or delete from the by-laws and rules and regulations of the advisory board of the parks and recreation department. Any changes must by approved by the city council.

                  Sec. 16-58. - Early retirement for police and fire personnel. 
                  (a)  Effective on September 1, 2003, all police and fire personnel have the option to retire at age fifty (50) with a minimum of twenty (20) years of vested service with a monthly annuity equal to two (2) percent of the employee's average monthly compensation multiplied by their years of benefit accrual service. Every vested police and fire personnel with a minimum age of fifty (50) years can retire with less than twenty (20) years of vested service at a reduced benefit. The monthly benefit would be equal to the employee's accrued benefit reduced by seven (7) percent a year for each year in which the termination date precedes the date the employee would have attained twenty (20) years of vested service. 
                  (b)  The entire cost to fund this early retirement at age fifty (50) with twenty (20) years of vested service is to be paid by all personnel of the police and fire departments. Each member will have to contribute the equivalent of five (5) years of the increased member contribution of this program prior to retirement. 
                  (c)  Employee's within the police and fire department who elect to retire early under this retirement option, are eligible to continue insurance coverage under the city's medical, dental and life insurance plan, but must pay the entire insurance premium between the age of fifty (50) and fifty-five (55). A retiree under this early retirement option who elects not to continue participation with the city's insurance provider would relinquish their right to all future insurance coverage through the city.

                  (1)  Whenever such a participant not covered by Social Security files an application for a disability retirement pension with the pension board, the participant shall submit therewith a signed certificate from a licensed practicing physician of Georgia certifying to the disability of such participant. Promptly thereafter the pension board shall order the participant to be examined by a physician to be named by the board who likewise shall certify the physical ability or disability of the participant. The pension board shall pay for the fees and expenses of such physician. In the event the certificates of the respective physicians generally agree upon disability, such facts shall be conclusive as to the physical condition of the participant and the pension board shall grant a disability retirement pension in accordance with Section 4.4 of the Plan Document for the City of Cartersville Pension Plan. In the event the certificates of the aforesaid physicians disagree as to whether the participant is disabled, then under these circumstances that question shall be submitted to a third physician selected by the pension board. The medical opinion of the third physician, after examination of the participant and consultation with the other two (2) physicians, shall decide such question. The participant and the pension board shall share the fees and expenses of the third physician equally. 
                  (2)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, no participant shall qualify for a disability retirement pension if the pension board determines that the participant's disability results from (i) self-addiction to alcohol or narcotics, (ii) an injury suffered while engaged in a felonious or criminal act or enterprise or (iii) service in the Armed Forces of the United States which entitles the participant to a veteran's disability pension; but this provision shall not prevent the participant from qualifying for a pension under another provision of the plan.

                  Sec. 16-60. - Disability retirement. 
                  (a)  Disability retirement: A participant shall be eligible for a disability retirement pension if their employment is terminated prior to their normal retirement date by reason of disability after they are vested in the pension plan. Payment of a disability retirement pension shall commence as of the first day of the month following the date the participant terminates employment due to disability, as long as the following conditions are met. 
                  (1)  Employee's medical condition occurred or became symptomatic during the time they were employed in an employee/employer relationship with the employer (City of Cartersville); 
                  (2)  Employee was totally and permanently disabled at the time they terminated employment; and 
                  (3)  Employee has not been employed with any other employer after such termination. 
                  (b)  The pension board shall have the right at intervals of not less than one (1) year, prior to a participant's normal retirement date, to require proof of continuing disability, such as to require the participant to submit proof of receipt of Social Security Disability Benefits or, in absence of that, to require an examination of any participant receiving a disability retirement pension; provided, however, for purposes of this section, a participant's normal retirement date shall be no earlier than their sixty-fifth (65 th ) birthday with ten (10) years of vesting service; or fifty-fifth (55 th ) birthday with twenty-five (25) years of vesting service; or fiftieth (50 th ) birthday with twenty (20) years of vesting service for police and fire personnel. In the event such participant is found not to be suffering from a disability, the pension board shall, after hearing evidence thereon and giving the participant opportunity to be heard, discontinue such participant's disability retirement pension. In the event such participant receiving a disability retirement pension refuses to submit to a physical examination after thirty (30) days notice to report for such examination or to supply proof, of continuing disability, the pension board shall discontinue payments of the disability retirement pension until the participant submits to such examination or supplies such proof, and the participant shall be deemed to have forfeited their pension during the time of refusal. Following certification that a participant's disability has ceased, in accordance with the foregoing provisions of the preceding paragraph, the following rules shall apply: 
                  (1)  Such participant shall not be prevented from qualifying for a pension under another provision of the plan based only upon their vesting service, benefit accrual service and compensation prior to their disability retirement; and 
                  (2)  Any such participant shall not receive vested service or benefit accrual service for their period of disability and any pension payments received during their disability period shall be disregarded. 
                  (c)  Workers' compensation benefits: Further notwithstanding any other provisions of the Cartersville Pension Plan, if at the time of retirement a participant is receiving payments under the provisions of the Georgia Workers' Compensation Law which are being paid at the expense of the city, the amount of pension payable under the plan shall be reduced by the amount being received as workers' compensation. This reduction shall continue as long as the retired participant is receiving workers' compensation, and upon discontinuance of workers' compensation payments, the offset shall be eliminated and the retired participant shall be entitled to receive sums as calculated under the terms of the pension plan. No such reduction shall operate to reduce the sums payable under the provisions of the Cartersville Pension Plan below two hundred dollars ($200.00) per month. 
                  (d)  The cost of providing a disability retirement option shall be paid by the city, in lieu of providing long-term disability insurance coverage for employees vested in the pension plan. 
                  (e)  Effective on September 1, 2003, all City of Cartersville personnel that are vested in the Cartersville Pension Plan have the option to apply for disability retirement if they meet the above guidelines.

                  b.  If the participant has not met the requirements of normal retirement under this plan, a monthly annuity equal to fifty (50) percent of the participant's accrued benefit as of the date of the participant's death payable to the spouse. The benefit shall begin on the first of the month coincident with or next following the later of the date the participant would have reached age fifty-five (55), with the provision that upon the death of the spouse, a lump sum is paid to the spouse's beneficiary equal to the amount, if any, by which the balance of the participant contributions, with interest accrued to the date of death of the participant at the rate of four (4) percent per annum, exceeds the sum of the annuity payments previously made to the spouse. 
                  c.  A lump sum payment equal to the participant contributions made by the participant plus interest accrued until the date of the participant's death at the rate of four (4) percent per annum. 
                  (2)  If the participant's death occurs where a benefit is not payable under subsection (1), the participant's beneficiary shall receive a lump sum payment equal to the participant contributions made by the participant plus interest accrued until the date of participant's death at the rate of four (4) percent per annum.

In this case, the employee should bring the allegation to the attention of the supervisor's immediate supervisor. 
                  (b)  The appropriate supervisor will investigate the allegations including, but not limited to, conducting interviews of all involved or allegedly involved parties. If after such an investigation, the above referenced supervisor determines he or she can resolve the problem then he or she should take appropriate action to do so. 
                  (c)  If, however, after such an initial investigation said supervisor determines that the allegations warrant further investigation, then at that time he or she will take the allegations and his or her findings to the city manager for further investigation, if necessary, and for the appropriate action. 
                  (d)  If said supervisor takes what he or she deems to be appropriate action, and either the accuser or the alleged harasser is dissatisfied with said action, then either of them may request a meeting with the city manager to discuss his or her dissatisfaction as well as other possible appropriate action to correct the alleged problem. The city manager shall then take the action he deems appropriate to resolve the situation.

                  Sec. 17-62. - Purpose. 
                  The purpose of this article is to provide standards for the installation of trees and landscaping as part of the land development process in order to enhance the quality of life within the city. The reasons for requiring trees on a site and in parking lots are to provide shade, reduce temperatures, reduce stormwater runoff, and reduce air and water pollution. 
                  The following regulations seek to establish minimum standards for the provision, installation, and maintenance of landscape plantings in order to achieve a healthy, beautiful, and safe community and to enhance the city's environmental and visual character for its citizens' use and enjoyment by the following means: 
                  (1)  Improve environmental quality by recognizing the numerous beneficial effects of landscaping upon the environment such as improving air and water quality through such natural processes as photosynthesis and mineral uptake; reducing and reversing air, noise, heat and chemical pollution through the biological filtering capacities of trees and other vegetation. 
                  (2)  Maintain and increase the value of land by requiring landscaping to be incorporated into development, thus becoming by itself a valuable capital asset. 
                  (3)  Provide direct and important physical and psychological benefits to human beings through the use of landscaping to reduce noise and glare, and to break up the monotony and soften the harsher aspects of urban development. 
                  (4)  Preserve existing natural vegetation where possible and incorporate native plants, plant communities, and ecosystems into landscape design.

                  Sec. 20-17. - Findings and purposes. 
                  (a)  Purposes. This article was enacted with the following purposes: 
                  (1)  To protect the rights of individuals and businesses to convey their messages through signs; 
                  (2)  To encourage the effective use of signs as a means of communication; 
                  (3)  To promote economic development; 
                  (4)  To improve traffic and pedestrian safety as it may be affected by distracting signs; 
                  (5)  To prevent the destruction of the natural beauty and environment of the city and to ensure the harmony and compatibility of the character of the area including its physical appearance, natural setting, informal landscaping, and preserve the historic character of the city; 
                  (6)  To encourage and ensure that development that is context-sensitive in design and materials compliments and is compatible and sensitive with the existing character of the area through its proportion, scale, design, style, placement, position, and architectural qualities that further the distinct values of the city; 
                  (7)  To protect the public health, safety and general welfare; 
                  (8)  To restrict the continued existence of abandoned or nonconforming signs unless in compliance with the terms of this article and to eliminate, over time, all nonconforming signs; 
                  (9)  To ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign standards; and 
                  (10)  To make it easier, quicker, and more economically efficient to apply for a sign permit. 
                  (b)  Findings. This article was enacted with the following findings in mind: 
                  (1)  The city finds that signs are a proper use of private property, are a means of personal free expression and a necessary component of a commercial environment. As such, signs are entitled to the protection of the law. In the absence of regulation, however, the number of such signs tends to proliferate, with property owners desiring ever increasing numbers and sizes of signs, leading to cluttered and aesthetically blighted thoroughfares. In addition, the competition among competing sign owners for visibility of their signs contributes to safety hazards for both vehicles and pedestrians and undermines the sign owners' original purpose of presenting a clear message of its idea or identification of its premises. 
                  (2)  The city further finds that the regulation of the size, height, number and spacing of signs is necessary to protect the public safety, to ensure compatibility of signs with surrounding land uses, to enhance the business and economy of the city, to protect the public investment in the streets and highways, to maintain the tranquil environment of residential areas, to promote industry and commerce, to eliminate visual clutter and blight, to provide an aesthetically appealing environment, and to provide for the orderly and reasonable display of advertising for the benefit of all the city's citizens. 
                  (3)  The city further finds that there is a substantial difference between signs erected by public authority and signs erected by private citizens or businesses. Signs erected by public authority are virtually all erected for the purpose of maintaining the public safety either through direct control of traffic or through provision of such type signage as street signs which enable the traveling public to know where they are located and to find where they are going. As such, with the exception of signs identifying government buildings, virtually all government signs are erected purely for public safety purposes. Moreover, their use in the public right-of-way is necessary to ensure their visibility to the motoring public. The city council finds that public utility signs are frequently of the same nature as those signs erected by governmental entities in that they provide necessary information to safeguard the public from downed power lines and from street excavations. Even where signs serve a propriety purpose, such as identifying markings on utility poles, those signs are marked primarily for the purpose of benefiting the public generally through identification of locations where there may be temporary losses of power. 
                  (4)  The city further finds that some signage has a single targeted function and that identification of such signage by description is impossible without referring to its function. For instance, address numerals are used for the sole purpose of locating addresses, which is of benefit to persons looking for those addresses and is essential to public safety personnel responding to emergencies. Subdivision signs at the entrances to subdivisions favor a similar purpose in enabling both the traveling public and emergency personnel to quickly locate subdivision entrances for the purpose of either visitation or responding to emergency calls. While such signage is referenced based upon the function it serves within the context of this article, the bulk of the provisions of this article are unrelated to the content of the speech provided and allow maximum expressive potential to sign owners.

                  (a)  Signs lawfully existing on the date of adoption of the ordinance from which this article derives, which do not conform to the provisions of this article shall be deemed to be legal nonconforming "grandfathered" signs and may remain, except as otherwise specifically qualified in this article. Such signs shall not be enlarged, extended, structurally reconstructed, replaced or altered in any manner; except a sign face may be changed so long as the new sign face does not increase either height or sign area. This provision shall not have the effect of excusing any violation of any other ordinance, nor shall this provision have the effect of permitting the continued existence of any unsafe sign or any sign that is not in good state of repair. 
                  (b)  Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent keeping in good repair a nonconforming sign.

                  (c)  A nonconforming sign shall not be moved for any distance on the same lot or to another lot unless such change in location will make the sign conform to the provisions of this article, and meet permit requirements of this article. 
                  (d)  If a nonconforming sign is removed or discontinued for any period of time, except for normal maintenance and repair, as defined in this article, or for maintenance of a building if such sign is attached to a building, the subsequent erection of a sign shall be in accordance with the provisions of this article. 
                  (e)  A nonconforming sign which is changed to or replaced by a conforming sign shall no longer be deemed nonconforming, and thereafter such sign shall be in accordance with the provisions of this article. 
                  (f)  Policy statement. As a consequence, when a nonconforming sign is destroyed or toppled by an act of God, weather, or whatever other means, this shall not constitute a sufficient reason for grant of a variance to re-erect the nonconforming sign.

In the event that any provision of this article is in genuine conflict with any state or federal law or requirement, the conflict shall be resolved in accordance with law. 
                  (b)  Interpretation. The words used in this article in the present tense shall include the future. Singular words include the plural, and plural words include the singular.

The city shall process all complete and accurate sign permit applications within fifteen (15) business days of the city's actual receipt of a complete and accurate application and upon remittance of the appropriate sign permit fee.

The director shall give notice to the applicant of his or her decision by hand delivery or by mailing such notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the address on the permit application on or before the 15th business day. If the decision of the director is to deny the application, the decision shall state the grounds upon which the denial is based. Failure of the city to act within the fifteen-day period shall be deemed a denial of the permit. If notice is mailed in conformity with this section, notice shall be deemed to have been given upon the date of mailing. Any application meeting the standards of this article will be granted. Any application not meeting the standards of this article will be denied. 
                  (c)  Appealable. A denial pursuant to this section shall be appealable pursuant to the procedures for zoning appeals outlined in the City of Cartersville Zoning Ordinance.

                  (d)  Resubmission. A denied application later resubmitted in conformity with this article shall be deemed to have been submitted on the date of resubmission, instead of the original submission date. An application which is resubmitted shall meet all the standards for an original application.

                  Sec. 20-38. - Revocation. 
                  (a)  Should it be determined that a sign permit was issued pursuant to an application containing a false material statement or omission, the director shall revoke said permit and the subject sign shall be immediately removed. A revocation pursuant to this section shall be appealable pursuant to the procedures for zoning appeals outlined in the City of Cartersville Zoning Ordinance. 
                  (b)  However, notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a final decision will be rendered within sixty (60) days from the date an appeal is filed.

                  (c)  Standards. The standards which shall be considered for granting a variance from the standards of this article shall be only the following: 
                  (1)  Relief to this article may only be granted where existing foliage or structures bring about a hardship whereby a sign meeting the maximum letter size, square footage and height requirements cannot be read from an adjoining road; 
                  (2)  The application of the particular provision of this sign ordinance to a particular piece of property, due to extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to that property because of its size, shape, or topography, would create an unnecessary hardship for the owner while causing no detriment to the public; or 
                  (3)  Conditions resulting from existing foliage or structures bring about a hardship whereby a sign meeting minimum letter size, square footage and height requirements can not be read from adjoining public road. 
                  (d)  Timing. The board of zoning appeals shall hear and decide upon a variance within eighty (80) days of the submission of a complete and accurate application. 
                  (e)  The fee assessed pursuant to this section is as referenced on the fee schedule in the City of Cartersville Code subsection 17-90(c).

                  (a)  Violation. A violation of any provision of this article shall be grounds for terminating the permit granted by the city to the permittee or the person or entity erecting the sign. No permit shall be suspended, revoked or canceled except for due cause, as hereinafter defined, and until after the permittee is granted a public hearing before the city council. 
                  (b)  Hearing. The permittee shall be given ten (10) days written notice of the time, place and purpose of the hearing, with a statement of the reason for the suspension, revocation or canceling of such permit and license.

The termination of the permit does not in any way preclude the city from taking any other action authorized by this Code or any action authorized by law, against the person alleged to have violated the standards of this chapter. 
                  (Ord. No. 26-12, 5-3-12)

                  (a)  A sign permit shall become null and void if the sign for which the permit was issued has not been installed and completed within six (6) months after the date of issuance; provided, however, that where an applicant can demonstrate that a commercial entity was timely engaged to construct the permitted sign, but the fabrication has not yet been completed, one (1) ninety-day extension may be granted by the director. 
                  (b)  No refunds shall be made for a permit after the permit is issued. If later an individual desires to erect a sign at the same location, a new application for the sign must be processed and another fee paid in accordance with the fee schedule applicable at such time.

Any violation of this article shall be an offense, and the violator shall be subject to a fine of up to one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per day. 
                  (b)  Dangerous and defective condition.

                  (c)  Noncompliance. No person shall erect on any premises owned or controlled by that person any sign which does not comply with the standards of this article. 
                  (d)  Notice.

If the permittee refuses to correct the deficiencies or remove the sign, the director will have the sign removed at the expense of the permittee. 
                  (e)  Public nuisance. Any violation of this article is hereby declared to be a public nuisance. 
                  (f)  Separate violation. Each sign installed, created, erected or maintained in violation of this article shall be considered a separate violation when applying the penalty portions herein.

The city may order the removal of any sign in violation of this article by written notice to the permit holder; or if there is no permit holder, then to the owner of the sign; or if the sign owner cannot be found or cannot be determined, then to the sign erector and any party that procured the erection of the sign. If a permit has been issued, such notice shall operate to revoke the permit. 
                  (b)  Procedure following removal order. If the sign is not removed within the time allowable pursuant to a removal order, the city may remove or cause to be removed the sign and collect the costs therefore.

                  Sec. 20-47. - Cases, sources and studies considered. 
                  In adopting these sign regulations, the mayor and city council recognize the vast number of court decisions, coming from Georgia courts, the federal courts, and courts throughout the United States, which recognize that the regulation of the size, location and quantity of sign structures is a valid and lawful means of achieving the above-stated intents and purposes, and that such intents and purposes are valid and lawful governmental interests, which include the following: 
                  •  City of Doraville v. Turner Communications, Corp., 236 Ga. 385 (1976) (finding that under its police power authority, a municipality can regulate the location and maintenance of outdoor advertising signs within their territorial jurisdiction); 
                  •  Granite State Outdoor Advertising, Inc. v. Cobb County, Ga., 193 Fed.Appx. 900 (C.A.11 th 2006) (finding that the stated goals within a sign ordinance of protecting against traffic hazards and the adverse impact on the county's aesthetic qualities are substantial government interests); 
                  •  Gregory v. Clive, 2007 WL 2914515 (Ga. S.Ct. 2007) (recognizing as within a local government's police power to enact legislation governing billboards and signs, as such legislation clearly addresses the public health, safety, or general welfare of the community); 
                  •  H and H Operations, Inc. v. City of Peachtree City, Ga., 248 Ga. 500 (1981) (holding that, under its police power, a municipality can enact and enforce reasonable regulations governing the erection and maintenance of signs within its jurisdiction); 
                  •  Harnish v. Manatee County, Florida, 783 F.2d 1535 (C.A. 11 th 1986) (finding that aesthetics is a substantial governmental goal which is entitled to and should be accorded weighty respect, and that the governmental entity charged with the responsibility of protecting the environment must be given discretion in determining how much protection is necessary and the best method of achieving that protection); 
                  •  Lamar Advertising Company v. City of Douglasville, Ga., 254 F.Supp.2d 1321 (N.D.Ga. 2003) (finding that where a sign ordinance asserts the goals of public safety, traffic safety, health, welfare and aesthetics, a municipality has shown an important or substantial governmental interest unrelated to the suppression of free speech); 
                  •  Members of the City Council of the City of Los Angeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U.S. 789 (1984) (finding that a government entity can regulate signs and billboards when necessary to advance a significant and legitimate state interest, such as the protection of the aesthetics and quality of life within its jurisdiction); 
                  •  Metromedia, Inc. v. City of San Diego, 453 U.S. 490 (1981) (holding that the goals of traffic safety and aesthetics advanced by a municipality as justification for regulating signs is a substantial governmental interest); 
                  •  St. Louis Poster Advertising Co. v. City of St. Louis, 249 U.S. 269 (1919) (finding that billboards may be prohibited in the residential districts of a city in the interest of the safety, morality, health and decency of the community); 
                  •  Spratlin Outdoor Media, Inc. v. City of Douglasville, 2006 WL 826077 (N.D.Ga. 2006) (upholding sign ordinance where the ordinance's height and setback restrictions were rationally related to its stated goals of promoting the health, safety, morality and general welfare of the community, promoting the orderly and beneficial development of the city, promoting adequate access to natural light and air, improving the aesthetic appearance of the city, and encouraging the most appropriate use of land and buildings in accordance with the city's comprehensive plan). 
                  Such cases, which were considered by the mayor and city council prior to adoption of this provision, are part of the official record of the adoption of the ordinance from which this chapter derives. 
                  (b)  Studies and sources considered. Having considered the following studies, which the mayor and city council find to be relevant, useful and applicable to the City of Cartersville, the city finds that the size, location and quantity of sign structures within the city must be regulated in order to achieve the above-stated intents and purposes:

                  When the superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the superintendent may serve upon that user a written notice of violation. Within seven (7) days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof to include specific required actions shall be submitted by the user to the superintendent. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the superintendent to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation. 
                  (Ord. No. 11-97, 4-10-97) 
                  Sec. 24-126. - Consent orders. 
                  The city may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance with a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to sections 24-128 and 24-129 [of] this article and shall be judicially enforceable. 
                  Sec. 24-127. - Show cause hearing. 
                  The superintendent may order a user which has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the superintendent and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least thirty (30) days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.

                  When the superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the superintendent may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, device or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established or pretreatment standard or requirement, not does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.

                  (1)  Immediately comply with all requirements; and 
                  (2)  Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. 
                  (b)  Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.

Such fines shall be assessed on a per-violation, per-day basis. In the case of monthly or other long term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation. 
                  (b)  Unpaid charges, fines and penalties shall, after fifteen (15) calendar days, be assessed an additional penalty of fifteen (15) percent of the unpaid balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of one and one-half (1½) percent per month. A lien against the user's property will be sought for unpaid charges, fines and penalties. 
                  (c)  Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for the superintendent to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount within thirty (30) days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit, the superintendent may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event the user's appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user. The superintendent may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine. 
                  (d)  Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against or a prerequisite for taking any other action against the user.

                  Sec. 24-131. - Emergency suspensions. 
                  (a)  The superintendent may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after informal notice to user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The superintendent may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment. 
                  (1)  Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the superintendent may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The superintendent may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the superintendent that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings [under] section 24-132 are initiated against the users. 
                  (2)  A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrences to the superintendent prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under sections 24-127 and 24-132 of this article. 
                  Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section.

                  In addition to the provisions in section 24-105 of this article, any user who violates the following conditions is subject to discharge termination: 
                  (1)  Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions; 
                  (2)  Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge; 
                  (3)  Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents and characteristics prior to discharge; 
                  (4)  Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring or sampling; or 
                  (5)  Violation of the pretreatment standards in division 2 of this article. 
                  Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under section 24-127 of this article why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the superintendent shall not be a bar to, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.

                  (a)  For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
                  (b)  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection (c) below are met. 
                  (c)  A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
                  (1)  An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset; 
                  (2)  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with operation and maintenance procedures; and 
                  (3)  The user has submitted the following information to the superintendent within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five (5) days): 
                  a.  A description of the indirect discharge and cause; 
                  b.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
                  c.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
                  (d)  In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
                  (e)  Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
                  (f)  Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails.

                  A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in section 24-83(a) of this article or the specific prohibitions in section 24-83(b)(3) through (18), excluding subsection (b)(8), of this article if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either: 
                  (1)  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to and during the pass through or interference; or 
                  (2)  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.

                  Sec. 24-144. - Bypass. 
                  (a)  For the purposes of this section: 
                  (1)  Bypass means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a user's treatment facility. 
                  (2)  Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
                  (b)  A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsections (c) and (d) of this section. 
                  (c)  (1)  If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the superintendent at least ten (10) days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
                  (2)  A user shall submit oral notice to the superintendent of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within twenty-four (24) hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five (5) days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The superintendent may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within twenty-four (24) hours. 
                  (d)  (1)  Bypass is prohibited and the superintendent may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless: 
                  a.  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
                  b.  There was no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment down time. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment down time or preventive maintenance; and 
                  c.  The user submitted notices as required under subsection (c) of this section. 
                  (2)  The superintendent may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the superintendent determines that it will meet the three (3) conditions listed in subsection (d)(1) of this section.

                  Sec. 24-145. - Generally. 
                  (a)  A permit from the city shall be obtained before a sewer tap is made, and such permit shall indicate that the prescribed fee has been made. 
                  (b)  Any unauthorized person making a tap shall be punished upon conviction of an offense. 
                  (c)  Nothing in this section shall prevent the installation of sewer lines by assessments of abutting property that have been duly petitioned, advertised and approved by the council and in the same manner as assessments are made for paving streets. 
                  (d)  Cut on and cut-off service charges for water and gas utilities inside and outside the city shall be fixed by the council. Meters shall be read when service is cut on. If service is restored for the same customer, any service used during the off period will be billed at twice the applicable rate as a penalty. 
                  (e)  Nonwater customers and those obtaining water from wells using the city sewer system are required to meter well pumpage and shall be charged the regular sewer service fees. The property owners shall pay the cost of the meter and installation by the water department. 
                  (f)  Fees associated with excessive discharges of conventional pollutants (BOD, TSS, COD) may or may not be punitive as deemed by the city. 
                  (g)  Fines for conventional pollutants (BOD, TSS, COD) can be waived, provided no harm occurred to the POTW, at the discretion of the city on a case-by-case basis. 
                  (h)  Wastewater discharges between three hundred (300) mg/l and six hundred (600) mg/l of BOD and/or TSS will be assessed a surcharge. Enforcement shall be initiated for discharges exceeding six hundred (600) mg/l. The purpose of the surcharge is to encourage treatment of wastes rather than relying on the POTW to handle excess BOD and/or TSS, and to require industries generating high strength waste to bear the cost. 
                  (1)  For samples with a difficult BOD to measure accurately, chemical oxygen demand (COD) may be substituted for BOD analysis. Wastewater discharges between seven hundred fifty (750) and two thousand five hundred (2,500) mg/l of COD will be assessed a surcharge. Enforcement shall be initiated for discharges exceeding two thousand five hundred (2,500) mg/l.

                  Sec. 24-148. - Low pressure systems. 
                  (1)  Preamble: 
                  WHEREAS, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has found low pressure sewer systems to have increased energy demands, higher maintenance requirements, and greater costs for homeowners; and 
                  WHEREAS, the mayor and city council deems it to be in the best interest of the citizens of the City of Cartersville to adopt additional regulations governing low pressure systems and permissible residential systems in general, 
                  NOW THEREFORE BE IT ORDAINED AND IT IS HEREBY ORDAINED, by virtue of the authority vested in the city council by law that the following waste treatment ordinance be adopted: 
                  (2)  Waste treatment ordinance—Purpose: It is the purpose of this section to regulate the available types of waste treatment options for individual uses in the City of Cartersville. The City of Cartersville has experience with individual septic systems and traditional gravity flow systems, and such systems are appropriate for the city. Under more limited circumstances, private sewage facilities may be permitted. The City of Cartersville recognizes that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has found low-pressure sewer systems to have increased energy demands, higher maintenance requirements, and higher costs to the homeowner. The city has further determined that the ongoing maintenance issues created by such systems lead to greater future problems than in a conventional gravity flow sewer system. Such systems have many more mechanical and powered parts and are therefore subject to much higher failure rates. Preventative maintenance requirements are higher and power outages can result in overflows and damage to residences. Life cycle replacement costs are higher than gravity sewers. Therefore, this section is adopted to regulate and prohibit such systems, in the interest of protecting the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the City of Cartersville. 
                  (3)  Definitions: As used in this division, words shall have their common meaning and significance, except for the specifically defined terms below: 
                  (a)  Effluent: The flow of liquids and solids from a structure's sewage plumbing system; e.g., human waste, waste water, etc. 
                  (b)  Low pressure sewer system: A sewer system that uses pressure to move the effluent from individual lots to the main sewer lines. Pressure sewers typically break down large solids in a pumping station located on an individual lost before they are transported through the collection system (sewer mains) to the treatment facility. Such systems include grinder pump systems and septic tank effluent pump systems. Systems which use a pump-to-pump waste from a septic tank to a septic field on the same lot are not included in this definition. 
                  (c)  Low pressure sewer system cluster: A pressure sewer system with a common low-pressure line that connects several residences by individual pumps to a central or common pump station. 
                  (d)  Private sewage facility means a privately owned sewage treatment facility providing sewage disposal to property owned only by a single owner. Examples would include a facility serving a single industrial site, or a facility serving a mobile home park where all lots are owned by a single owner. 
                  (e)  Public sewage facility means a sewage treatment facility providing sewage disposal to more than one (1) property owned by different owners. Examples would include a facility serving an industrial park with several owners, or a facility serving a subdivision with separate homeowners. 
                  (4)  Regulation of waste treatment facilities: 
                  (a)  Low-pressure sewer systems (including low pressure sewer system clusters) are prohibited in the City of Cartersville. Individual residential lots are required to be connected to a public gravity flow sewer system. 
                  (b)  Sewage treatment and handling systems for individual residential lots not otherwise covered or defined specifically by this section, or as may be invested in the future, shall only be permitted upon approval of the water superintendent. The applicant shall submit an application as required by the city, containing plans, specifications and other information considered pertinent in the judgment of the superintendent. The superintendent shall not permit systems or technologies that are unproven, that increase the risks of environmental contamination, that do not meet the standards contained in the City of Cartersville Code of Ordinances or standards as may be adopted by the City of Cartersville Water Department or other applicable ordinance, that increase costs or burdens on the city's sewer system or to individual property owners, or that are found to be a threat in any way to the health, safety or welfare of the citizens of the city. 
                  (5)  Interpretation: It shall be the duty of the City of Cartersville Water Superintendent to classify proposed systems. If there is a question as to the type of system proposed, or whether it is permitted or prohibited, the superintendent shall make the final interpretation for the water department. His determination may be appealed to the city manager.

                  Sec. 24-176. - Determination of billing demand. 
                  (a)  The billing demand shall be based upon the average of customer's hourly metered demands that coincide with the fifteen (15) highest MEAG system loads occurring during the period from June 1 through and including September 30 of the current contract year, which is June 1 through May 31. Until that date and times of the fifteen (15) highest MEAG system hourly peaks are determined, an estimate of the customer's billing demand, mutually agreed upon by the customer and the city, will be used to bill the customer. When the actual billing demand has been determined, the customer subsequently will be billed on the basis of the actual billing demand, and all prior bills during the contract year will be recalculated and rendered to the customer for payment or refund based upon the actual billing demand. 
                  (b)  The determination of the billing demand may be modified in the future to reflect changes in wholesale billing demand determination to the city by MEAG. This rider may be reviewed periodically by the city as its appropriate compensation and applicability.

                  (a)  Excess capacity. That the City of Cartersville Gas System (CGS) has entered into various agreements with Southern Natural Gas Company (Southern) whereby CGS has reserved firm capacity to serve its firm requirements. For the reservation of this firm capacity CGS pays Southern a monthly reservation fee. From time to time, CGS has excess firm capacity that it may wish to broker. CGS, at its sole discretion, will determine when there is excess firm capacity to broker. CGS will offer the excess firm capacity first to customers within CGS and secondly to other outside CGS. Brokering of capacity within CGS is limited to CGS transportation customers. Excess capacity will be disposed of through the bidding process at a market sensitive price. 
                  (b)  Buy-sell agreements prior to 11-1-93. Any winning bidder, who entered into a buy-sell agreement with CGS before November 1, 1993, may choose to use their buy-sell agreement under the conditions set forth by that buy-sell agreement. If a buy-sell agreement is not used by a customer within CGS, then the wellhead cost of gas shall be the ″Spot Price″ for the month in which the capacity is being used, plus a mutually agreed upon premium and applicable pipeline shrinkage. 
                  (c)  Spot price. shall mean the average of the spot prices published by each of the following publications in the first issue of the month for delivery to the pipeline system of Southern during the month in which any unexcused failure by buyer to purchase or sell to deliver gas in accordance with the terms of the buy-sell agreement occurs:

                  (d)  Bidding. When CGS has determined that excess capacity is available, it will solicit sealed bids from those qualified transportation customers for the excess capacity. A bidder may bid on a portion or all of the excess capacity. The excess capacity, if brokered, will be awarded to the bidder(s) whose bid is determined by CGS to be in CGS best economic interest. CGS reserves the right to reject any an all bids. If CGS rejects any or all bids, or if excess capacity remains after the initial bidding process, CGS may offer the excess capacity to others outside CGS. CGS reserves the right to reject any and all bids. 
                  (e)  Recall ability. Any capacity brokered is recallable with a minimum 4 hour notice, for either CGS system supply or in the event of a limitation on Southern's system. However, anytime capacity is recalled, that capacity will be recalled starting with the lowest price bid and moving up in price until the amount of capacity needed is recalled. Whenever capacity is recalled, the price bid will be prorated for the days that the capacity was not available in a given month. 
                  (f)  Use prohibition. Unless CGS has rejected bids from customers within CGS due to price, CGS will not allow any capacity obtained from outside its system to be used until CGS excess capacity is fully subscribed. 
                  (g)  Intention. It is the intention of the city council and it is hereby ordained that the provisions of this ordinance shall become and be made part of this Code and the sections of this ordinance may be renumbered to accomplish such intention.

                  (2)  In any month that a customer's total banked volume divided by the customer's total consumption for that month exceeds ten (10) percent, that customer shall pay to the city a penalty charge equal to one dollar ($1.00)/decatherm times the total banked volume. 
                  (3)  If a customer has a bank in excess of ten (10) percent for three (3) consecutive months, then at the end of the third month the customer releases all claims and/or title to the gas and the entire banked volume becomes the property of the city. However, if a customer can prove to the city's satisfaction, that due to operational difficulties the customer was not able or will not be able to use the banked volume, then at the city's discretion the city may buy the banked volume at a cost not to exceed the city's lowest gas cost. 
                  (g)  Balancing. 
                  (1)  During normal operations, balancing shall be on a monthly basis.

                  (3)  If in the city's opinion a customer is not following the above mentioned provisions, the city may elect in its sole discretion any or all of the following options: 
                  a.  To place the customer on daily balancing until further notice. 
                  b.  To discontinue transportation service for the customer until customer proves to the city's satisfaction, the ability to comply with the above provisions. 
                  (h)  Character of service. 
                  (1)  All gas delivered under this rate schedule shall be subject to curtailment in whole or in part only after city has used reasonable efforts to give at least two (2) hours notice to customer by telephone or otherwise, except in force majeure or emergency conditions. City may curtail customers served under this rate schedule in such order and each customer to such extent as city deems necessary for the proper operation of its distribution system. Subject to the foregoing, curtailment by city hereunder shall be made pursuant to the load control provisions in effect from time to time. Upon notice of curtailment by city, the customer must promptly discontinue use of gas as provided in the curtailment notice. 
                  (2)  It is contemplated that all gas received into city's system will be gas delivered out of a commingled stream from the pipeline system of Southern Natural Gas. The service contemplated hereunder is of an industrial character and city does not guarantee the chemical composition or specific gravity of the gas delivered, nor does city guarantee such gas to be free from interruptions or fluctuations in delivery pressure or that the chemical composition or specific gravity of the gas delivered may not vary from time to time. There is no warranty, express or implied, as to the fitness of gas delivered pursuant to this schedule for use in the customer's operations. 
                  (i)  Terms and provisions of service under this rider. 
                  (1)  Except as expressly modified by the provisions of this rider, all of the terms, provisions, and conditions of the interruptible schedule (as made effective by the council from time to time) applicable to customer shall also apply to service by city to customer under this rider. 
                  (2)  Notwithstanding other curtailment provision applicable to gas furnished by city, all deliveries under this rider shall be subject to curtailment by city only in order to protect or maintain city's natural gas system, or by reason of event of force majeure as defined in the applicable rate schedule or contract. City will endeavor to give two (2) hours prior notice of curtailment and will endeavor to advise customers of impending curtailment with as much advance notice as possible. 
                  (3)  Gas transported by city under this rider shall remain the sole property of the customer but city reserves the right to commingle such gas with city-owned gas. 
                  (4)  The customer shall comply with any reasonable notification or nomination procedures in relation to direct transportation service that city may from time to time prescribe, provided that city notifies the customer of such procedures in writing in advance. 
                  (5)  The quantity of gas delivered into city's facilities for the account of the customer shall be determined by reference to the records of Southern. If the volumes shown on any nomination(s) to Southern by a customer (or its gas vendor) do not match the volumes shown on the monthly statement of Southern to city, city will use the volumes shown on Southern's monthly statement and shall notify the customer of such changes as soon as reasonably practicable. If the customer uses a gas vendor who also procures gas for other customers on city's system, that vendor's aggregate nomination to Southern (i.e., the sum of the nominations for all customers of the vendor on city's system) may be confirmed by city with Southern. If such aggregate nomination does not match the monthly statement of Southern, city may use the volumes shown on Southern's monthly statement, and, unless notified by the vendor of the correct allocation among the vendor's customers, may prorate the revised aggregate nomination among all of such customers proportionally on the basis of the quantities to be received by each such customer before proration. City shall notify such customers of such change as soon as reasonably practical, and shall have no liability to any customer for any such proration. 
                  (6)  Customer is responsible for making all arrangements for transporting the customer's gas from its source of supply to city's interconnection with Southern. 
                  (7)  Customer shall warrant that customer has good and legal title to all gas at and after such time as it has been delivered into city's facilities and a legal right to have such gas delivered to city. Customer shall hold city harmless from any loss or claim arising from a breach of such warranties. 
                  (8)  Contracts for service shall be in writing and specify in writing the daily and hourly rates of consumption and shall be for a minimum period of one (1) year. 
                  (9)  The amount of: 
                  a.  any sales, gross receipts, franchise, excise, privilege, occupation or other tax or charge whether imposed by statute or otherwise that city pays to any governmental body, based on, or determined by, the sale of gas hereunder; and 
                  b.  any charge paid by city to any gas supplier as a result of any sales, excise, gross receipts, or other taxes, license fee, or governmental charges imposed upon such supplier, based on, or determined by, the production, severance, manufacture, transportation or sale of gas hereunder, shall be added to and become a part of the charges to the customer under this rate schedule; provided, however, if any additional payments are imposed upon the customer by reason of this clause, the customer may by thirty (30) days notice in writing to city, cancel his contract for service under this rate schedule and discontinue the use of natural gas service under this rate schedule. 
                  (10)  When gas is delivered at a pressure in excess of 14.73 pounds per square inch absolute, then for the purpose of measurement hereunder, such volumes of gas shall be corrected to a pressure of 14.73 pounds per square inch absolute. It is assumed that the atmospheric pressure is 14.4 pounds per square inch. The measurement of gas volumes shall be adjusted for deviation from Boyle's Law in accordance with generally accepted engineering practices through positive displacement meters at a pressure not in excess of twenty (20) pounds per square inch gauge, at which the gas shall be assumed to obey Boyle's Law. 
                  Where rotary or turbine type meters are used on installations where customer's annual usage is more than thirty thousand (30,000) decatherms, all volumes measured by such meters shall be corrected to a base temperature of sixty (60) degrees Fahrenheit. 
                  (11)  Gas purchased under this rate shall not be resold by the purchaser thereof in any manner, and city will discontinue service upon notice to the customer when it is determined that gas is being resold in violation of this provision of the rate schedule in the event the customer does not immediately discontinue such resale after such notice. 
                  (12)  In the event either city or its suppliers is unable, wholly or in part, by reason of force majeure or as a result of a curtailment plan permitted to become effective by the regulatory body having jurisdiction, to carry out its obligations, it is agreed that on giving notice of such force majeure as soon as possible after the occurrence of the cause relied on, the obligations of city so far as they are affected by such force majeure or curtailment plan shall be suspended during the continuance of any inability so caused but for no longer period, and such cause shall as far as possible be remedied with all reasonable dispatch. 
                  (13)  City reserves the right to refuse to accept customer owned gas for the account of the customer into city's facilities if customer is unable to or fails to follow the terms of this rider. 
                  (j)  Additional terms and provisions. Service under this schedule is subject to applicable ordinances, terms and conditions of service and rules and regulations of city, as enacted or approved by the city council of the city from time to time, as well as all current and future riders and tariff provisions made applicable to service under this schedule.

                  (a)  Introduction. Whereas, the City of Cartersville must consider twenty-four (24) federal electric utility rate and service standards, and one (1) non-standard, as required by law since we now sell over five hundred million (500,000,000) kWh's of electricity per year. The intent of these laws is to provide increased conservation, efficiency, and equitable retail rates. These standards must be considered and either accepted or rejected with an explanation; 
                  Whereas, each standard should be addressed by ordinance to meet the federal requirements of a) address in writing, b) hold a public hearing, and c) make available to the public; 
                  Whereas, each standard stated below has been considered by the electric superintendent, and a recommendation provided for the mayor and city council; 
                  Whereas, a public hearing has been held on the proposed standards by the mayor and city council on the third day of June, 2010. 
                  Whereas, the applicable laws governing these federal standards are the Public Utility Regulatory Act of 1978 (PURPA) (standards 1-6), the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT 1992) (standards 7-10), the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT 2005) (standards 11-15), the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA 2007) (standards 16-19), and Title 16 USCA Chapter 46 §2601 et seq. (standards 1-24, non-standard 1). 
                  (b)  Analysis of standards. 
                  (1)  Cost of service. It is recommended that the mayor and city council adopt an alternative standard to the federal standard. 
                  The basis is that the City of Cartersville "nondemand" electric rates are typically designed for differences in cost-incurrence attributable to seasonal time of use but not daily time of use due to the lack of public interest and wide use of advanced metering. Electric "demand" rates are typically designed for differences in cost-incurrence attributable to customer demand and energy components of cost. Daily time of use options will likely be considered in the future as public interest grows and an electric meter replacement project is undertaken and appropriate daily time of use meters installed. A power cost adjustment is applicable to all electric rates and is utilized to account for additional capacity added to meet peak demand relative to base demand and additional kilowatt-hours of electric energy delivered to electric consumers. The power cost adjustment is reset when a new cost of service study is performed and these differences are included in the revised rates. 
                  (2)  Declining block rates. It is recommended that the mayor and city council adopt an alternative standard to the federal standard. 
                  The basis is that the City of Cartersville utilizes declining block electric demand rates and can demonstrate that cost of energy decreases as customer consumption increases due to assignment of generation greater than load. However, use of declining block demand rates may continue to be used even if costs do not decrease as consumption increases if it is determined to promote economic development or for other reasons. 
                  (3)  Time-of-day rates. It is recommended that the mayor and city council adopt an alternative standard to the federal standard. 
                  The basis is that the City of Cartersville does not utilize time of day electric rates due to cost-effectiveness resulting from lack of public interest and wide use of advanced metering. Daily time of use options may be considered as public interest grows and an electric meter replacement project is undertaken and appropriate daily time of use meters installed. 
                  (4)  Seasonal rates. It is recommended that the mayor and city council adopt an alternative standard to the federal standard. 
                  The basis is that the City of Cartersville uses seasonal differences for major "nondemand" electric rates and seasonal billing demand calculations for major "demand" electric rates. However, miscellaneous electric rates for construction, flat power, outdoor lighting, and temporary incentive rates are not appropriate for this seasonal change. 
                  (5)  Interruptible rates. It is recommended that the mayor and city council adopt an alternative standard to the federal standard. 
                  The basis is that the City of Cartersville typically offers interruptible electric rates to those consumers with the ability to curtail at times and levels that will reduce wholesale cost to the utility; however, it is not practical or cost-effective to offer an interruptible rate to each industrial and commercial consumer. 
                  (6)  Load management techniques. It is recommended that the mayor and city council adopt the federal standard. 
                  The basis is that the federal standard is consistent with our current practices. 
                  (7)  Integrated resource planning. It is recommended that the mayor and city council adopt the federal standard. 
                  The basis is that the federal standard is consistent with our current practices. 
                  (8)  Investments in conservation and demand management. The proposed standard is not applicable to the City of Cartersville, and as such should not be adopted. 
                  The basis is that the federal standard is applicable to a state regulated utility, which for the purposes of the standard is not applicable to the City of Cartersville. 
                  (9)  Energy efficiency investments in power generation and supply. It is recommended that the mayor and city council adopt the federal standard. 
                  The basis is that the federal standard is consistent with our current practices. 
                  (10)  Consideration of the effects of wholesale power purchases on utility cost of capital; effects of leveraged capital structures on the reliability of wholesale power sellers; and assurance of adequate fuel supplies. The proposed standard is not applicable to the City of Cartersville, and as such should not be adopted. 
                  The basis is that the federal standard is applicable to a state regulated utility, which for the purposes of the standard is not applicable to the City of Cartersville. 
                  (11)  Net metering. It is recommended that the mayor and city council adopt an alternative standard to the federal standard. 
                  The basis is that there is a state law that fully addresses this issue in Georgia (O.C.G.A. § 46-3-50 et. seq.). 
                  (12)  Fuel sources. It is recommended that the mayor and city council adopt the federal standard. 
                  The basis is that the federal standard is consistent with our current practices. 
                  (13)  Fossil fuel generation efficiency. The proposed standard is not applicable to the City of Cartersville, and as such should not be adopted. The basis is that the City of Cartersville's fossil fuel interests are held by the Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia. 
                  (14)  Time-based metering and communications. It is recommended that the mayor and city council adopt an alternative standard to the federal standard. 
                  The basis is that the City of Cartersville does not utilize time-based metering due to cost-effectiveness resulting from lack of public interest and wide use of advanced metering. Time based metering options may be considered as public interest grows and an electric meter replacement project is undertaken and appropriate daily time of use meters installed. 
                  (15)  Interconnection. It is recommended that the mayor and city council adopt an alternative standard to the federal standard. 
                  The basis is that there is a state law that fully addresses this issue in Georgia (O.C.G.A. § 46-3-50 et. seq.). 
                  (16)  Integrated resource planning. It is recommended that the mayor and city council adopt the federal standard. 
                  The basis is that the federal standard is consistent with our current practices.

                  The basis is that the federal standard is applicable to a state regulated utility, which for the purposes of the standard is not applicable to the City of Cartersville. 
                  (19)  Smart grid information. It is recommended that the mayor and city council adopt an alternative standard to the federal standard. 
                  The basis is that the City of Cartersville does not utilize due to cost-effectiveness resulting from lack of public interest and wide use of advanced metering. The options relating to Smart Grid information may be considered as public interest grows and an electric meter replacement project is undertaken and appropriate daily time of use meters installed. 
                  (20)  Master metering. It is recommended that the mayor and city council adopt the federal standard. 
                  The basis is that the federal standard is consistent with our current practices. 
                  (21)  Automatic adjustment clauses. It is recommended that the mayor and city council adopt an alternative standard to the federal standard. 
                  The basis is that the City of Cartersville electric automatic adjustment clause is evaluated with each cost of service study and approved by city council. 
                  (22)  Information to consumers. It is recommended that the mayor and city council adopt an alternative standard to the federal standard. 
                  The basis is that the original standard includes mailing each customer a rate sheet when they receive service and every year thereafter. It also includes mailing each customer their previous twelve-month history each month. City of Cartersville electric rates are "open records," available via the internet, a detailed explanation of such rate is available to all consumers upon request, and a personal visit from staff to the consumer's location is available to each customer. Current consumers monthly bills provide the rate name, consumption data for the billing period, consumption data for the previous billing period, and consumption data for the same billing period of the previous year. 
                  (23)  Procedures for termination of electric service. It is recommended that the mayor and city council adopt an alternative standard to the federal standard. 
                  The basis is that the City of Cartersville does not provide prior notice and dispute opportunity to consumers in cases of unsafe or unlawfully obtained services. Termination of service involving consumers with health issues will follow existing "disconnection during illness" policy. 
                  (24)  Advertising. It is recommended that the mayor and city council adopt an alternative standard to the federal standard. 
                  The basis is that the City of Cartersville electric utility is owned by the public it serves and is not subject to this standard but makes such standard not to conduct political advertising. 
                  (25)  The single non-standard: Lifeline rates. It is recommended that the mayor and city council decline said non-standard. 
                  The basis is that the City of Cartersville residential electric rate is based on a cost of service study for such class of consumer. A rate lower than this rate would increase costs to other residential consumers. 
                  (c)  Adopted standards. 
                  (1)  Cost of service. Electric rates charged by the City of Cartersville for providing electric service to each class of electric consumers shall be designed, to the extent practicable, to reflect the costs of providing electric service to such class by a) permitting identification of differences in cost-incurrence, for each such class of electric consumers, attributable to seasonal time of use of service, and/or b) permitting identification of differences in cost-incurrence attributable to differences in customer demand, and energy components of cost. Both methods shall take into account the extent to which total costs are likely to change if additional capacity is added to meet peak demand relative to base demand, and additional kilowatt-hours of electric energy are delivered to electric consumers. 
                  (2)  Declining block rates. The City of Cartersville utilizes declining block electric demand rates and can demonstrate that cost of energy decreases as customer consumption increases due to assignment of generation greater than load. However, use of declining block demand rates may continue to be used even if costs do not decrease as consumption increases if it is determined to promote economic development or for other reasons. 
                  (3)  Time-of-day rates. The electric rates charged by the City of Cartersville for providing electric service to each class of electric consumers may include in whole or in part a time-of-day basis which reflects the costs of providing electric service to such class of electric consumers at different times of the day unless such rates are not cost-effective with respect to such class. A time-of-day rate shall be determined to be cost-effective with respect to each such class if the long-run benefits of such rate to the City of Cartersville and its electric consumers in the class concerned are likely to exceed the metering and communications costs and other costs associated with the use of such rates. 
                  (4)  Seasonal rates. The electric rates charged by the City of Cartersville for providing electric service to each class of electric consumers shall typically be on a seasonal basis which reflects the costs of providing service to such class of consumers at different seasons of the year to the extent that such costs vary seasonally for the utility. 
                  (5)  Interruptible rates. The City of Cartersville may offer an industrial or commercial electric consumer an interruptible rate which reflects the cost of providing interruptible service to the class of which such consumer is a member if it is determined such consumer can and will reduce the wholesale cost to the utility. 
                  (6)  Load management techniques. The City of Cartersville shall offer to its electric consumers such load management techniques that the City has determined will: 
                  a.  Be practicable and cost-effective, as determined by: 
                  1.  Such technique is likely to reduce maximum kilowatt demand on the City of Cartersville, and 
                  2.  The long-run cost-savings to the utility of such reduction are likely to exceed the long-run costs to the utility associated with implementation of such technique. 
                  b.  Be reliable, and 
                  c.  Provide useful energy or capacity management advantages to the City of Cartersville. 
                  (7)  Integrated resource planning. The City of Cartersville shall employ integrated resource planning. All plans or filings before a state regulatory authority to meet the requirements of this paragraph must be updated on a regular basis, must provide the opportunity for public participation and comment, and contain a requirement that the plan be implemented. However, currently the City of Cartersville is not required to file integrated resource planning with the state regulatory bodies. 
                  (8)  Investments in conservation and demand management. This standard is not applicable to the City of Cartersville. 
                  (9)  Energy efficiency investments in power generation and supply. The rates charged by the City of Cartersville shall be such that the City is encouraged to make investments in, and expenditures for, all cost-effective improvements in the energy efficiency of power generation, transmission and distribution. In considering regulatory changes to achieve the objectives of this paragraph, the City of Cartersville shall consider the disincentives caused by existing ratemaking policies, and practices, and consider incentives that would encourage better maintenance, and investment in more efficient power generation, transmission and distribution equipment. 
                  (10)  Consideration of the effects of wholesale power purchases on utility cost of capital; effects of leveraged capital structures on the reliability of wholesale power sellers; and assurance of adequate fuel supplies. This federal standard is applicable to a state regulated utility but is not applicable to the City of Cartersville. 
                  (11)  Net metering. The City of Cartersville adopts by reference the applicable requirements of O.C.G.A. § 46-3-50 (2008) et seq.

                  3.  Including the impact on adoption of energy efficiency as one of the goals of retail rate design, recognizing that energy efficiency must be balanced with other objectives; 
                  4.  Adopting rate designs that encourage energy efficiency for each customer class; 
                  5.  Allowing timely recovery of energy efficiency-related costs; and 
                  6.  Offering home energy audits, offering demand response programs, publicizing the financial and environmental benefits associated with making home energy efficiency improvements, and educating homeowners about all existing federal and state incentives, including the availability of low-cost loans, that make energy efficiency improvements more affordable. 
                  (18)  Consideration of smart grid investments. This federal standard is applicable to a state regulated utility but is not applicable to the City of Cartersville. 
                  (19)  Smart grid information. The City of Cartersville City of Cartersville does not currently utilize due to cost-effectiveness resulting from lack of public interest and wide use of advanced metering. The options relating to Smart Grid information may be considered as public interest grows and an electric meter replacement project is undertaken and appropriate daily time of use meters and/or time-based metering is installed. 
                  (20)  Master metering. Master metering of electric service in the case of new buildings shall be prohibited or restricted to the extent necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter unless to the extent determined appropriate by: 
                  a.  There is more than one (1) unit in such building, 
                  b  The occupant of each such unit has control over a portion of the electric energy used in such unit, and 
                  c.  With respect to such portion of electric energy used in such unit, the long-run benefits to the electric consumers in such building exceed the costs of purchasing and installing separate meters in such building. 
                  (21)  Automatic adjustment clauses. The City of Cartersville power cost adjustment clause for electric rates shall be determined after a public hearing and consider incentives for efficient use of resources (including incentives for economical purchase and use of fuel and electric energy) by the City of Cartersville, and insure the maximum economies in those operations and purchases which affect the rates to which such clause applies. The mayor and city council shall examine and, if appropriate, cause to be audited the practices of the City of Cartersville electric system relating to costs subject to an automatic adjustment clause, and shall require such reports as may be necessary to carry out such review. 
                  (22)  Information to consumers. The City of Cartersville shall transmit to an electric consumer a clear and concise explanation of the existing rate schedule and any rate schedule applied for applicable to such consumer upon request. The City of Cartersville shall transmit to such consumer a clear and concise statement of the actual consumption of electric energy by such consumer for each billing period (unless such consumption data is not reasonably ascertainable by the city). 
                  (23)  Procedures for termination of electric service. Electric service provided by the City of Cartersville may not be terminated unless reasonable prior notice is given to such consumer and such consumer has a reasonable opportunity to dispute the reasons for such termination except in situations where service has been determined as unsafe or unlawfully obtained. 
                  (24)  Advertising. The City of Cartersville electric system may not recover from any person of such utility any direct or indirect expenditure by such utility for political advertising, including, but not limited to, the commercial use of any media, including newspaper, printed matter, radio, and television, in order to transmit a message to a substantial number of members of the public or to such utility's electric consumers for the purpose of influencing public opinion with respect to legislative, administrative, or electoral matters, or with respect to any controversial issue of public importance not directly related to utility operations or costs to the consumer. 
                  (25)  The single non-standard: Lifeline rates. The City of Cartersville declines this non-standard as its residential electric rate is based on a cost of service study for such class of consumer. A rate lower than this rate would increase costs to other residential consumers

                  (b)  Applicability. 
                  To all extra large power customers of CES receiving services as of July, 2018. 
                  This rider applies to incremental (increased) consumption and demands which are defined as: 
                  (1)  Baseline: the historical interval data from twelve (12) months prior to the start date of expansion. 
                  (2)  Incremental consumption: the difference between customer's consumption from current billing month and baseline consumption from the corresponding month. 
                  (3)  Incremental demands: 
                  a.  Transmission incremental demand: the difference between customer's demand on the date and time of MEAG's system peak from the current billing month and baseline demand from corresponding month and time. 
                  b.  Reserve incremental demand: the difference between customer's peak demand from current billing month and the baseline's peak demand in the corresponding month. 
                  (4)  On a monthly basis, incremental consumption must exceed baseline consumption by five (5) percent in order for the incremental consumption and incremental demands to be billed at the monthly rate below. 
                  (5)  This rider will be effective for five (5) years from the start date of expansion. 
                  (c)  Type of service.

                  (2)  Definitions: 
                  Bill Mo. = Customer's bill for service under this tariff in a specific month. 
                  TBD KW = transmission incremental demand. 
                  Transmission Rate = See provision for Transmission Capacity Cost. 
                  RBD KW = reserve incremental demand × 1.15. 
                  Reserve Rate = See provision for Reserve Capacity Cost. 
                  ∑ = Sum over all hours of the monthly billing period. 
                  kWh Hr = Customer's kWh usage in the specific hour. 
                  Price Hr = MEAG Power's Posted Hourly Market Price in $/kWh. 
                  PCA Rate = Current month PCA rate ($/kWh). 
                  FCC Rate = Current month FCC rate (in %). 
                  ECC Rate = Current month ECC rate (in %). 
                  Margin Rate = $0.005/kWh. 
                  Tax $ = Applicable state and local Sales tax(es) will apply to all components of the rate. 
                  (e)  Transmission capacity cost. 
                  (1)  Transmission capacity cost (in $/kW-month) is based on the annually budget transmission rate by MEAG multiplied by transmission billing demand occurring in the applicable billing month. 
                  (f)  Reserve capacity cost. 
                  (1)  Reserve capacity cost (in $/kW-month) is a rate that is determined by MEAG multiplied by reserve billing demand. For customers without 12-month measured demand history, reserve billing demand is the monthly peak demand until a full 12-month history is established. 
                  (g)  Pricing transparency. 
                  (1)  Customer shall receive an Excel bill from CES which shall illustrate exactly how the bill was computed for the particular billing month. 
                  (f)  Late payments. 
                  (1)  If payment is not received by the due date printed on the bill, services are subject to late charges, service disconnect and reconnect fees and interruption of services.

                  ARTICLE XII. - STORMWATER MANAGEMENT 

                  Sec. 24-433. - Findings. 
                  The City Council of the City of Cartersville, Georgia makes the following findings: 
                  (a)  The professional engineering and financing analysis (stormwater management action plan) submitted to the city properly assesses and defines the stormwater management problems, needs, goals, program priorities, and funding opportunities of the city. [A copy is on file and available to the public at the city clerk's office and in the office of the public works department, stormwater utility.] 
                  (b)  Given the problems, needs, goals, program priorities, and funding opportunities identified in the professional engineering and financing analysis, it is appropriate to authorize the formation of an organizational and accounting entity dedicated to the management, maintenance, protection, control, regulation, use, and enhancement of stormwater systems in the incorporated limits of the City of Cartersville in concert with other water resource management programs. 
                  (c)  Stormwater management is applicable and needed throughout the corporate limits of Cartersville. While specific service and facility demands may differ from area to area at any given time, a stormwater management service area encompassing all lands and water bodies within the corporate limits of Cartersville is consistent with the present and future needs of the community. 
                  (d)  The stormwater needs in the City of Cartersville include but are not limited to protecting the public health, safety, and welfare. Provision of stormwater management programs and facilities renders and/or results in both service and benefit to all properties, property owners, tenants, occupants, citizens, and residents of Cartersville in a variety of ways as identified in the professional engineering and financial analysis. The service and benefit rendered or resulting from provision of stormwater management systems and facilities may differ depending on many factors and considerations, including but not limited to location, demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater systems and programs, and risk exposure. 
                  (e)  The City of Cartersville presently owns and operates a public stormwater management system which has been developed over many years. The future usefulness of the existing stormwater system owned and operated by the city, and of additions and improvements thereto, rests on the ability of the city to effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use, and enhance stormwater systems and facilities in its corporate limits in concert with the management of other water resources in its corporate limits. In order to do so, the city must have adequate and stable funding for its stormwater management program operating and capital investment needs. 
                  (f)  The mayor and city council finds, concludes, and determines that a utility provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering and funding stormwater management services in Cartersville.

                  Sec. 24-434. - Establishment of a utility and enterprise fund. 
                  (a)  There is hereby established a stormwater utility to be a separate division of the public works department which shall be responsible for stormwater management throughout the city's corporate limits, and shall provide for the management, protection, control, regulation, use, regulatory compliance, and enhancement of stormwater systems and facilities. 
                  (b)  The city manager shall establish a stormwater enterprise fund in the city budget and accounting system for the purpose of dedicating and protecting all funding applicable to the purposes and responsibilities of the stormwater utility, including but not limited to rentals, rates, charges, fees, and licenses as may be established by the mayor and city council. Any revenues and receipts of the stormwater utility shall be placed in the stormwater enterprise fund and all expenses of the stormwater utility shall be paid from the stormwater enterprise fund, except that other revenues, receipts, and resources not accounted for in the stormwater utility enterprise fund may be applied to stormwater management operations and capital investments as deemed appropriate by the mayor and city council, upon recommendation of the city manager. 
                  (c)  The mayor and city council hereby transfers to the stormwater utility operational control over the existing stormwater management systems and facilities owned and heretofore operated by the city and other related assets, including but not limited to properties upon which such facilities are located, easements, rights-of-entry and access, and certain equipment.

                  Stormwater utility service charge and fee revenues shall be assigned and dedicated solely to the stormwater management enterprise fund in the city budget and accounting system, which shall be and remain separate from other funds, and shall be used only to fund identified stormwater management program activities. The services charges and fees paid to and collected by virtue of the provision of this article shall not be used for general or other governmental or proprietary purposes of the city, except to pay for costs incurred by the city in rendering services associated with the stormwater management utility. 
                  (Ord. No. 74-06, § 1, 11-2-06) 
                  Sec. 24-439. - Exemptions and credits applicable to stormwater service charges. 
                  Except as provided in this section, no public or private property shall be exempt from stormwater utility service charges or receive a credit or offset against such service charges. No exception, credit, offset, or other reduction in stormwater service charges shall be granted based on the age, tax, or economic status, race, or religion of the customer, or other condition unrelated to the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater services and facilities. Credits shall be defined and made available on two (2) general bases: the ability of a site to reduce its impact on the stormwater system, and the ability of an educational institution to reduce the city's cost of service through its actions in educating its students. Credits shall be available to other developed lands as defined herein: 
                  (a)  Undeveloped land in its natural state as defined in this chapter and land not containing more than four hundred (400) square feet of impervious area shall be exempt from stormwater service charges. 
                  (b)  Railroad tracks shall be exempt from stormwater service charges. However, railroad stations, maintenance buildings, or other developed land used for railroad purposes shall not be exempt from stormwater service charges. 
                  (c)  Any property whereby one-hundred (100) percent of the stormwater runoff up to and including the design storm which has a one (1) percent chance of occurrence (commonly called the twenty-four-hour, one hundred-year storm) is contained on the premises and no runoff enters into the stormwater management system. The total volume is infiltrated, evaporated, or used for purposes unrelated to stormwater runoff. 
                  (d)  The stormwater service charge credit shall be determined based on the technical requirements and standards contained in the Stormwater Utility Service Charge Credit Technical Manual. The stormwater service charge credit for non-educationally related actions may be up to sixty (60) percent of the service charge applicable to a property, and shall be proportional to the extent that on-site systems, facilities, services, and activities provided, operated, and maintained by the ratepayer, reduce or mitigate the stormwater utility's cost of providing services and facilities. The director or appointed representative shall make a final determination of credit eligibility. 
                  (e)  Credits for on-site stormwater systems shall be generally proportional and related to the effect that such systems have on the: pollution runoff, channel eroding force, peak rate of runoff from the site, and the ability of the site to manage floodplain impacting runoff as expressed in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual (GSMM), copy of which is on file and available to the public at the city clerk's office and in the office of the public works department, stormwater utility. A stormwater utility service charge credit technical manual shall be prepared by the department of public works and is hereby adopted by the city as a part of this article, the original of which shall be kept in the office of the city clerk. The manual shall specify the design and performance standards of on-site systems, facilities, activities, and services which qualify for application of a service charge credit, and how such credits shall be calculated. 
                  (f)  Credits up to fifty (50) percent shall be available to qualified educational institutions that provide an approved course of study that educates students on key aspects of water conservation, pollution prevention, and other topics related to surface and ground water quality. Obtaining such credit does not preclude such educational institution from obtaining additional credits up to a limit of one hundred (100) percent of the fee. Details of such qualifications and credit shall be contained in the Stormwater Utility Service Charge Credit Technical Manual which shall be prepared by the department of public works specifying the educational requirements which qualify for application of a service charge credit, and how such credits shall be calculated. 
                  (g)  Developed land other than individual detached dwelling units may receive a stormwater service charge credit. 
                  (h)  Groups of detached and individual dwelling units represented by an incorporated homeowner's association providing on-site systems, facilities, services, or activities that reduce or mitigate the stormwater utility's cost of providing services and facilities may receive a stormwater service charge credit in a manner similar to other developed land. 
                  (i)  In the first year of the stormwater utility, ratepayers seeking service charge credits must submit to the director a stormwater service charge credit application prior to January 1st, 2008. Approved applications shall receive a stormwater credit retroactive to the effective date of stormwater charges. After January 1st, 2008 credits will only be granted through applications approved by the director for the remainder of the year in which stormwater service charges are to be billed. 
                  (j)  Upon receipt of a timely, completed application, the director or his/her designee shall review the application and make a determination as to whether the applicable criteria for a credit have been met. All decisions regarding the approval or disapproval of a stormwater credit shall be made within forty-five (45) days of the date the completed application was submitted to the city. 
                  (k)  Any credit allowed against the service charge is conditioned on (1) continuing compliance with the city's design and performance standards as stated in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual as may be updated or amended from time to time which is hereby adopted by reference by the city and is to be made a part of this article; and (2) upon continuing provision of the systems, facilities or programs provided, operated, and maintained by the ratepayer, upon which the credit is based. The city may revoke any credit at any time for non-compliance with this article. 
                  (l)  Continuing compliance with the city's design and performance standards may be verified by city personnel physical inspection of the systems or facilities upon which the credit is based. No credit shall be given under this article unless the ratepayer, agrees in writing in its application that the city shall have the right for its designated officers, representatives, agents, and employees to enter upon private and public property, upon reasonable notice to the ratepayer of such property, to inspect the property and conduct surveys and engineering testing, on such property in order to assure compliance with the city's design and performance standards. On-site systems or facilities determined to no longer comply with the city's design and performance standards shall subject the ratepayer, to revocation of all, or a portion of, stormwater service charge credits based on the city inspectors' estimate of capacity reduction for a period of not less than one (1) year.

                  Sec. 24-441. - Inspection of property and stormwater systems. 
                  Every ratepayer, of real property located in the city, and every person who serves as a contractor or developer for the purpose of developing real property located in the city shall provide, manage, maintain, and operate on-site stormwater management systems and facilities sufficient to collect, convey, detain, control and discharge stormwater in a safe manner consistent with all City of Cartersville ordinances and development regulations, and the laws of the State of Georgia and the United States of America. Any failure to meet this obligation shall constitute a nuisance and be subject to an abatement action filed by any damaged party or the City of Cartersville in the Municipal Court of the City of Cartersville, or any court of competent jurisdiction. In the event a public nuisance is found by the court to exist, which the ratepayer, fails to properly abate within such reasonable time as allowed by the court, the city may enter upon the property and cause such work as is reasonably necessary to abate the nuisance with the actual cost thereof assessed against the ratepayer, or contractor or developer, if any, on a joint and several basis. From the date of the filing of such action, the city shall have lien rights, which may be perfected, after judgment, by filing a notice of lien on the General Execution Docket of the Superior Court of Bartow County. The City of Cartersville shall have the right, pursuant to the authority of this article, for its designated officers and employees to enter upon private and public property owned by entities other than the city, upon reasonable notice to the ratepayer, thereof, to inspect the property and conduct surveys and engineering tests thereon in order to ensure compliance with this section.

                  --- (38) --- 
                  Editor's note— Ord. No. 75-06, § 1, adopted November 2, 2006, set out provisions intended for use as §§ 24-440—24-449. For purposes of clarity, and at the editor's discretion, these provisions have been included as §§ 24-451—24-459. 

                  Sec. 24-451. - Findings. 
                  The City Council of the City of Cartersville, Georgia makes the following findings: 
                  (a)  The professional engineering and financing analysis (Stormwater Management Action Plan) submitted to the city properly assesses and defines the stormwater management problems, needs, goals, program priorities and funding opportunities of the city. 
                  (b)  Given the problems, needs, goals, program priorities, and funding opportunities identified in the professional engineering and financing analysis, it is appropriate to authorize the formation of an organizational and accounting entity dedicated specifically to the management, maintenance, protection, control, regulation, use, and enhancement of stormwater systems in Cartersville in concert with other water resource management programs. 
                  (c)  Stormwater management is applicable and needed throughout the corporate limits of Cartersville. While specific service and facility demands may differ from area to area at any given point in time, a stormwater management service area encompassing all lands and water bodies within the corporate limits of Cartersville is consistent with the present and future needs of the community. 
                  (d)  The stormwater needs in the City of Cartersville include but are not limited to protecting the public health, safety, and welfare. Provision of stormwater management programs and facilities renders and/or results in both service and benefit to all properties, property owners, citizens, and residents of Cartersville in a variety of ways as identified in the professional engineering and financial analysis. The service and benefit rendered or resulting from provision of stormwater management systems and facilities may differ depending on many factors and considerations, including but not limited to location, demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater systems and programs, and risk exposure. 
                  (e)  The City of Cartersville presently owns and operates stormwater management systems and facilities which have been developed over many years. The future usefulness of the existing stormwater systems owned and operated by the city, and of additions and improvements thereto, rests on the ability of the city to effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use, and enhance stormwater systems and facilities in Cartersville in concert with the management of other water resources in the city. In order to do so, the city must have adequate and stable funding for its stormwater management program operating and capital investment needs. 
                  (f)  The mayor and city council finds, concludes and determines that a utility provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering and funding stormwater management services in Cartersville.

                  Sec. 24-452. - Establishment of a utility and enterprise fund. 
                  (a)  There is hereby established a stormwater utility to be a separate division of the public works department which shall be responsible for stormwater management throughout the city's corporate limits, and shall provide for the management, protection, control, regulation, use, regulatory compliance, and enhancement of stormwater systems and facilities. 
                  (b)  A stormwater enterprise fund shall be established in the city budget and accounting system for the purpose of dedicating and protecting all funding applicable to the purposes and responsibilities of the utility, including but not limited to rentals, rates, charges, fees, and licenses as may be established by the mayor and city council. Any revenues and receipts of the stormwater utility shall be placed in the stormwater enterprise fund and all expenses of the utility shall be paid from the stormwater enterprise fund, except that other revenues, receipts, and resources not accounted for in the stormwater utility enterprise fund may be applied to stormwater management operations and capital investments as deemed appropriate by the mayor and city council. 
                  (c)  The mayor and city council hereby transfers to the stormwater utility operational control over the existing stormwater management systems and facilities owned and heretofore operated by the city and other related assets, including but not limited to properties upon which such facilities are located, easements, rights-of-entry and access, and certain equipment. 
                  (Ord. No. 75-06, § 1, 11-2-06) 
                  Sec. 24-453. - Definitions. 
                  Customers of the stormwater utility. Customers of the stormwater utility shall include all persons, properties, and entities served by and/or benefiting from the utility's acquisition, management, maintenance, extension, and improvement of the public stormwater management systems and facilities and regulation of public and private stormwater systems, facilities, and activities related thereto, and persons, properties, and entities which will ultimately be served or benefited as a result of the stormwater management program. 
                  Hydrologic response. The hydrologic response of a property is the manner and means whereby stormwater collects, remains, infiltrates, and is conveyed from a property. It is dependent on several factors including, but not limited to, the presence of impervious area, the size, shape, topographic, vegetative, and geologic conditions of a property, antecedent moisture conditions, and groundwater conditions on a property. 
                  Impervious surfaces. Impervious surfaces are those areas which prevent or impede the infiltration of stormwater into the soil as it entered in natural conditions prior to development. Common impervious areas include, but are not limited to, rooftops, sidewalks, walkways, patio areas, driveways, parking lots, storage areas, compacted gravel and soil surfaces, awnings and other fabric or plastic coverings, and other surfaces which prevent or impede the natural infiltration of stormwater runoff which existed prior to development. 
                  Stormwater management system. Stormwater management systems address the issues of drainage management (flooding) and environmental quality (pollution, erosion and sedimentation) of receiving rivers, streams, creeks, lakes, ponds, and reservoirs through improvements, maintenance, regulation and funding of plants, works, instrumentalities and properties used or useful in the collection, retention, detention, and treatment of stormwater or surface water drainage. 
                  Undeveloped land. Land in its unaltered natural state or which has been modified to such minimal degree as to have a hydrologic response comparable to land in an unaltered natural state shall be deemed undeveloped. Undeveloped land shall have no pavement, asphalt, or compacted gravel surfaces or structures which create an impervious surface that would prevent infiltration of stormwater or cause stormwater to collect, concentrate, or flow in a manner materially different than that which would occur if the land was in an unaltered natural state. 
                  (Ord. No. 75-06, § 1, 11-2-06) 
                  Sec. 24-454. - Scope of responsibility for the city drainage system. 
                  The city drainage system consists of all rivers, streams, creeks, branches, lakes, reservoirs, ponds, drainage ways, channels, ditches, swales, storm sewers, culverts, inlets, catch basins, pipes, head walls and other structures, natural or man-made, within the political boundaries of the City of Cartersville which control and/or convey stormwater through which the city intentionally diverts surface waters from its public streets and properties. The city owns or has legal access for purposes of operation, maintenance and improvements to those segments of this system which: 
                  (1)  Are located within public streets, rights-of-way, and easements; 
                  (2)  Are subject to easements, rights-of-entry, rights-of-access, rights-of-use, or other permanent provisions for adequate access for operation, maintenance, and/or improvement of systems and facilities; or 
                  (3)  Are located on public lands to which the city has adequate access for operation, maintenance, and/or improvement of systems and facilities. 
                  Operation and maintenance of stormwater systems and facilities which are located on private property or public property not owned by the City of Cartersville and for which there has been no public dedication of such systems and facilities for operation, maintenance, and/or improvement of the systems and facilities shall be and remain the legal responsibility of the property owner, except as that responsibility may be otherwise affected by the laws of the State of Georgia and the United States of America. 
                  It is the intent of this article to protect the public health, safety and general welfare of all properties and persons in general, but not to create any special duty or relationship with any individual person or to any specified property within or without the boundaries of the City of Cartersville. The City of Cartersville expressly reserves the right to assert all available immunities and defenses in any action seeking to impose monetary damages upon the city, its officers, employees and agents arising out of any alleged failure or breach of duty or relationship as may now exist or hereafter be created. To the extent any permit, plan approval, inspection or similar act is required by the city as a condition precedent to any activity by or upon property not owned by the city, pursuant to this or any other regulatory ordinance, regulation or rule of the city or under federal or state law, the issuance of such permit, plan approval, or inspection shall not be deemed to constitute a warranty, express or implied, nor shall afford the basis for any action, including any action based on failure to permit or negligent issuance of a permit, seeking the imposition of money damages against the city, its officers, employees or agents. 
                  (Ord. No. 75-06, § 1, 11-2-06) 
                  Sec. 24-455. - Requirements for on-site stormwater systems; enforcement methods and inspections. 
                  All property owners and developers of developed real property within the City of Cartersville shall provide, manage, maintain, and operate on-site stormwater systems sufficient to collect, convey, detain, and discharge stormwater in a safe manner consistent with all City of Cartersville development regulations and the laws of the State of Georgia and the United States of America. Any failure to meet this obligation shall constitute a nuisance and may be subject to an abatement action filed by the city in the municipal court. In the event a public nuisance is found by the court to exist, which the owner fails to properly abate within such reasonable time as allowed by the court, the city may enter upon the property and cause such work as is reasonably necessary to be performed, with the actual cost thereof assessed against the owner in the same manner as a tax levied against the property. From date of the filing of such action, the city shall have lien rights which may be perfected, after judgment, by filing a notice of lien on the General Execution Docket of the Superior Court of Bartow County. The city shall have the right, pursuant to the authority of this article, for its designated officers and employees to enter upon private and public property owned by entities other than the city, upon reasonable notice to the owner thereof, to inspect the property and conduct surveys and engineering tests thereon in order to assure compliance. 
                  (Ord. No. 75-06, § 1, 11-2-06) 
                  Sec. 24-456. - General financing policy. 
                  It shall be the policy of the city that funding for the stormwater utility be equitably derived through methods which have a demonstrable relationship to the varied demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater systems and programs and/or the level of service provided as a result of the provision of stormwater services and facilities. Service charges for stormwater management shall be fair and reasonable and shall bear a substantial relationship to the cost of providing services and facilities. The cost of stormwater services and facilities may include operating, capital investment, and reserve expenses, and may consider stormwater quality as well as stormwater quantity management requirements. Similarly situated properties shall be charged similar rentals, rates, charges, fees, or licenses. 
                  Service charge rates shall be designed to be consistent and coordinated with the use of other funding methods employed for stormwater management by the city, whether within or outside the stormwater utility, including but not limited to plan review and inspection fees, special fees for services, fees in-lieu of regulatory requirements, impact fees, system development charges, and special assessments. To the extent practicable, credits-against service charges and/or other methods of funding stormwater management shall be provided for on-site stormwater control systems and activities constructed, operated, maintained and performed to the city's standards by private property owners.

                  Sec. 24-457. - Cost analysis and rate study. 
                  Upon adoption of this article, the city staff, together with its consulting engineers, shall conduct a cost of services analysis and rate study, which shall be presented to the mayor and city council for their approval, by ordinance, prior to the rendering of any bills to customers of the stormwater utility system.

                  Sec. 14.1. - Purpose. 
                  The purpose of the Business Park Overlay District is to provide uniform regulations for a joint City of Cartersville-Bartow County industrial/business park, a portion of which is located in each jurisdiction. To provide consistency for property owners and future uses, and to benefit the public health, safety and welfare, the city and county have adopted identical regulations as follows. The Business Park Overlay District, where applied via amendment to the official zoning maps of the participating government, shall control over inconsistent regulations contained in other ordinances and the Code of Ordinances of each jurisdiction, whether or not the provisions herein are stronger or weaker restrictions. 
                  Sec. 14.2. - Boundary map. 
                  The boundaries of the portion of the business park located within the city limits of Cartersville are shown in the boundary map included as Exhibit "B" in Article XXV, which is hereby incorporated into and made part of this article by reference. 
                  Sec. 14.3. - General area, height and setback regulations. 
                  Minimum lot size: One (1) acre. 
                  Maximum lot coverage (impervious surface limitation): Seventy-five (75) percent. 
                  Required lot width at street right of way (internal street): Forty (40) feet (twenty-five (25) feet in cul-de-sac). 
                  Front setback: Forty (40) feet. 
                  Side setback: Fifteen (15) feet. 
                  Rear setback: Twenty (20) feet. 
                  Maximum building height (see below): Fifty (50) feet. 
                  Buffers (see below): Fifty (50) feet except as noted. 
                  A.  The zoning administrator may grant an administrative variance of up to twenty (20) percent to any of the general area, height and setback regulations listed above. Additionally, he or she may grant an administrative variance on the undisturbed buffer requirements, if the proposed landscaping and screening in the buffer enhances the screening of the adjacent property. 
                  B.  Building height. With the approval of the zoning administrator, maximum height may be increased by variance. Building height limitations shall not apply to accessory structures such as water towers, conveyer belts, smokestacks and other incidental and uninhabited parts of industrial uses. 
                  C.  Buffers. A fifty-foot buffer shall apply adjacent to all land uses, except that no buffers shall be required from industrial to industrial. Further, there shall be a two hundred-foot buffer required where shown on the overlay district map adjacent to existing residential uses as of the date of adoption of the overlay district. When any of the existing residential uses are rezoned to a nonresidential zoning classification, the buffer adjacent to that property shall be reduced to fifty (50) feet, unless it is a similar zoning classification, in which case the buffer requirement shall not apply. Buffers shall be undisturbed, except that, if the buffer is adjacent to a residential use, and is insufficiently dense to be opaque to vision year-round, the zoning administrator may require that the buffer shall be planted with sufficient vegetation so that it is opaque year-round, to a depth of at least twenty-five (25) feet. Buffers may be used for perpendicular crossing by access roads and utilities, but not for lateral roads or parking. Buffers may be used for detention ponds, provided that vegetative screening remains or is planted between the pond and the property line. The zoning administrator shall approve buffer plans and plantings. 
                  D.  Setbacks shall be measured from the property or lot line. As setback exceptions, the following may intrude into the setback zone: unsupported roof overhangs, steps, walkways and access roads, landscaping and irrigation systems, planters, architectural fences and walls not exceeding forty-two (42) inches, and underground utilities and sewers. 
                  Sec. 14.4. - Permitted uses.

Occupancy shall not be allowed unless the required off-street parking and service facilities have been provided in accordance with those shown on the approved plan. These provisions shall not apply to the DBD district. 
                  Sec. 17.2. - Drainage, construction, and maintenance. 
                  In nonsingle-family districts, all off-street parking, loading, and service areas shall be drained so as to prevent damage to abutting properties and/or public streets and shall be paved with a material such as concrete, asphalt or pavers which will assure a surface resistant to erosion. Outdoor storage yards and less traveled interior drives in commercial and industrial areas may be surfaced with gravel; the use of impervious surface materials such as concrete or asphalt is discouraged on outdoor storage yards and less traveled interior drives because of increased stormwater runoff associated with such paving materials. Driveways and parking spaces for all single-family uses shall be surfaced with an all-weather surface material (e.g., gravel, pavers, concrete, or asphalt); when gravel is used as a surface material on driveways serving single-family uses, a concrete or asphalt paved apron shall be required to meet the road; said apron shall have a minimum length of five (5) feet.

                  Sec. 17.5. - Pavement markings and signs. 
                  Each off-street parking space shall be clearly marked, and directional arrows or signs shall be provided whenever necessary.

                  Sec. 18.2. - Nonconforming open uses of land. 
                  Nonconforming uses consisting of lots used for storage yards, used car lots, auto salvage yards, golf driving ranges, miniature golf and similar open uses where the only buildings on the lot are incidental and accessory to the open use of the lot and where such use of the land is not permitted to be established hereafter under this chapter in the district in which it is located, shall be governed by the following restrictions in addition to the other requirements in this chapter: 
                  A.  When a nonconforming open use of land has been changed to a conforming use, it shall not thereafter be used for any nonconforming use.

                  C.  When any nonconforming open use of land is discontinued or abandoned, regardless of intent, for a period in excess of twelve (12) months, any future use of the land shall be limited to those uses permitted in that district under the provisions of this chapter. Vacancy and/or nonuse of the land, regardless of the intent of the owner or tenant, shall constitute discontinuance under this provision. 
                  Sec. 18.3. - Nonconforming use of structures. 
                  Nonconforming uses consisting of structures and/or land or appurtenances used in conjunction with the primary purpose of the structure, at the time of the passage of this chapter, for purposes not permitted in the district in which they are located shall in addition to the other requirements of this chapter be governed by the following restrictions: 
                  A.  An existing nonconforming use of a structure and/or land or appurtenances used in conjunction with the primary purpose of the structure may be changed to another nonconforming use that is similar in its operation and effect on surrounding properties or may be changed to a conforming use. 
                  B.  An existing nonconforming use of a structure and/or land or appurtenances used in conjunction with the primary purpose of the structure shall not be changed to another nonconforming use that generates more automobile or truck traffic, creates more noise, vibration, smoke, dust or fumes, is a more intensive use of structures than the existing nonconforming use, and is in any way a greater nuisance to the adjoining properties than the existing nonconforming use. 
                  C.  A nonconforming use of a structure and/or land or appurtenances used in conjunction with the primary purpose of the structure shall not be extended or enlarged except into portions of the structure which at the time the use became nonconforming were already erected and arranged or designed for such nonconforming use. No structural alterations shall be made in any structure occupied by a nonconforming use, which would in any way increase the floor space, area, or volume of space occupied by the use, except that the mayor and council may, after a public hearing and review of the proposed plan, grant a special use if it is determined that said use will not be detrimental to the neighboring properties and is not contrary to the intent of this chapter. 
                  D.  When any nonconforming use of a structure and/or land or appurtenances used in conjunction with the primary purpose of the structure is discontinued for a period in excess of twelve (12) months, any future use of the structure shall be limited to those uses permitted in that district unless otherwise approved by the mayor and council. Vacancy and/or nonuse of the building, regardless of the intent of the owner or tenant, shall constitute discontinuance under this provision. 
                  (Ord. No. 02-15, § 1, 3-5-15) 
                  Sec. 18.4. - Reconstruction of nonconforming structures. 
                  When a nonconforming structure or a structure containing a nonconforming use is razed or damaged by fire, flood, wind, or act of nature, such structure may be reconstructed as a nonconforming use only if the damage totals less than seventy-five (75) percent of the value of the structure; however, this provision shall not apply to owner-occupied dwellings. Structures which do not conform to the yard requirements of this chapter shall also be governed by this provision. 
                  Sec. 18.5. - Intended nonconforming use. 
                  Any intended nonconforming use for which a vested right was acquired prior to the adoption of this chapter or the adoption of an amendment thereto shall be prohibited unless such is actually commenced within twelve (12) months of the adoption of this chapter or the adoption of an amendment thereto regardless of the intent or expectation to commence or abandon such nonconforming use. 
                  Sec. 18.6. - Changes in zoning.

                  Sec. 18-7. - Expansion of existing nonconforming uses requiring special use permits. 
                  No nonconforming use, building, structure and/or land or appurtenances used in conjunction with the primary purpose of the structure, requiring a special use permit under the terms of this chapter, including any use, building or structure that was authorized as of right prior to the adoption of this chapter but would require a special use permit upon the adoption of this chapter, shall be enlarged, expanded, moved, or otherwise altered in any manner except after application for and approval of a special use permit. Normal repair and maintenance of buildings and structures is authorized without the need for special use permits. No such use, building or structure which has been discontinued for a continuous period of six (6) months shall be re-established unless such cessation is a direct result of governmental action impeding access to the property.

                  Such administrative variance may be granted in an individual case upon a finding by the zoning administrator that one (1) or more of the following exists: 
                  1.  There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape, or topography; and 
                  2.  The application of these regulations to this particular piece of property would create a practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship; and 
                  3.  Such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of property involved; and 
                  4.  Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purposes and intent of these regulations, provided, however, that no variance may be granted for a use of land or building or structure that is prohibited by this chapter; and 
                  5.  A literal interpretation of this chapter would deprive the applicant of any rights that others in the same district are allowed. 
                  Remedy. Appeals from a decision by the zoning administrator shall be in accordance with the provisions of Article XXI of this chapter. 
                  Records. The zoning administrator shall keep public records of all administrative variances applied for and granted pursuant to this chapter. 
                  Sec. 19.3. - Conflict. 
                  This chapter shall supersede any other zoning regulations previously adopted or issued that are in conflict with any of the provisions of this chapter. This chapter shall not abolish any easements, covenants or other agreements between parties; provided, however, that whenever this chapter imposes a greater restriction upon the use of buildings or land than are imposed by such easements, covenants or agreements, the provisions of the chapter shall control. 
                  Sec. 19.4. - Zoning enforcement officer; appeals. 
                  The provisions of this chapter shall be administered and enforced by the zoning administrator, and/or his/her designee.

Decisions of the zoning administrator may be appealed in accordance with the provisions of this article. Requests for a variance other than an administrative variance shall be heard and decided by the board of appeals in accordance with the guidelines set forth in Article XXI. 
                  Sec. 19.5. - Remedies. 
                  In case any building is erected, constructed, reconstructed, altered, repaired, converted or maintained, or any building or land is used in violation of this chapter, the zoning administrator, or any other appropriate city authority or any other person who would be damaged by such violation, in addition to other remedies, may seek injunctive, mandamus or other appropriate relief to prevent the violation in the case of each building or use of land. 
                  Sec. 19.6. - Permits in effect. 
                  Nothing herein shall require any change in the plans, construction, size or designated use of any land, building, structure or part thereof for which a building permit or land disturbance permit was issued or vested right established prior to the effective date of this chapter or amendment thereto. 
                  Sec. 19.7. - Periodic review of zoning ordinance. 
                  As needed, but at intervals of not more than four (4) years, the planning commission shall re-examine the provisions of this chapter and the location of district boundary lines and shall submit a report to the mayor and city council recommending such changes or amendments, if any, which may be desirable in the interest of public safety, health, convenience, necessity, or general welfare. 
                  Sec. 19.8. - Enforcement actions. 
                  19.8.1.  Enforcement options. Enforcement of this chapter may be through criminal prosecution, civil fines, or other civil proceedings.

No warrant shall be required to investigate visible and open violations or uses. 
                  B.  No person shall obstruct, hamper or interfere with any city representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties in the enforcement of this chapter. 
                  19.8.2.  Persons who may be cited.

For any violation, both the owner of the property and/or the individual agent, tenant or invitee of the owner responsible for the violation may be cited, where appropriate. Agents of the owner would include, but not be limited to, developers, builders, contractors, and subcontractors. Tenants and invitees would include, but not be limited to, any renter, leaseholder, owner of any vehicle or structure on the property, or other person conducting an activity on the property who is not a trespasser. Corporations and companies responsible for the work may be cited in lieu of or in addition to citations issued to the actual individuals on-site committing violations. 
                  19.8.3.  Daily violations. Each day during which the violation or failure or refusal to comply continues shall constitute a separate violation, subjecting the offender to a new citation, or other civil or criminal proceeding. 
                  19.8.4.  Multiple violations. Each separate action, omission, or occurrence relating to any specific provision of this chapter shall be a separate violation, subjecting the offender to a separate citation.

                  B.  Each citation shall state the time and place at which the accused is to appear for trial in municipal court, shall identify the offense with which the accused is charged, shall have an identifying number by which it shall be filed with the court, shall indicate the identity of the accused and the date of service, and shall be signed by the police officer, code enforcement officer, or other authorized officer who completes and serves it. 
                  C.  Any defendant who fails to appear for trial shall thereafter be arrested on the warrant of the municipal court judge and required to post a bond for his or her future appearance. 
                  D.  The city attorney, or another attorney designated by City of Cartersville may act as prosecuting attorney for violations of this chapter. 
                  E.  Fines shall be assessed in accordance with section 20.2. 
                  19.8.6.  Civil fines and proceedings. In addition to or in lieu of any other remedy, the city may seek injunctive, mandamus or other appropriate relief in municipal court as appropriate or the superior court of Bartow County to enjoin or prevent a violation of any provision of this chapter. Such action may also seek civil fines at the mandatory rates specified in section 20.2 for violation of this chapter, and may additionally seek the costs of restitution, and any other costs associated with the action to enjoin or prevent any violation of any provision of this chapter. The city shall be entitled to its reasonable attorney's fees and costs for bringing an action in municipal court or superior court wherein any relief is granted or fine assessed. 
                  19.8.7.  Stop work orders. Upon notice from the zoning administrator, designated code enforcement officers, or other authorized personnel, work on any project that is being done contrary to the provisions of this chapter shall be immediately stopped. 
                  A.  Stop work orders shall affect all work being done on a project or development (which may include work done on other lots in the subdivision owned by the same violator). Stop work orders stop not only the work in violation, but all other work by contractors or subcontractors on the same property. Only work to remedy the deficiency shall be allowed until the stop work order is lifted. 
                  B.  A stop work order shall be in writing and shall be given to the owner of the property, his authorized agent or the person or persons in charge of the activity on the property, and shall state the conditions under which work may be resumed. Where an emergency or other exigent circumstances exist, no written notice shall be required, and a verbal stop work order may be issued, with a written order to be provided within three (3) working days. 
                  C.  Stop work orders may be issued on their own, or in conjunction with criminal citations, or civil proceedings in municipal court or superior court. 
                  D.  Issuance of a stop work order may be appealed to the board of appeals. 
                  Sec. 19.9. - Records. 
                  The zoning department shall keep records of violators, whether corporate or individual, in order to determine when second or subsequent violations occur.

With respect to violations of this chapter that are continuous with respect to time, each day the violation continues is a separate offense. 
                  ARTICLE XXI. - APPEALS 

                  Sec. 21.1. - Establishment of board of zoning appeals. 
                  21.1.1.  The board of zoning appeals, also referred to as the board of appeals, was established by previous version of this chapter, and remains authorized under this chapter. Existing board members shall continue in their current terms unaffected by the adoption of this chapter. The board consists of seven (7) members appointed by the mayor and city council for staggered terms of four (4) years; except the mayor's appointee, who has a two-year term. Each successive appointment shall be for staggered terms of four (4) years; except the mayor's appointee, who has a two-year term. 
                  21.1.2.  Each board member shall receive compensation for his/her service as established by the mayor and city council and shall be reimbursed for any expenses incurred while representing the board. Any vacancy in the membership of the board of appeals shall be filled for the unexpired term in the same manner as the initial appointment. Members shall be removable for cause by the mayor and city council upon written charges and after public hearing. The board of appeals previously appointed under the authority of the prior zoning ordinance shall continue without change as if appointed under this chapter. After expiration of their term, members shall continue to serve until, either reappointed or a successor appointed by the mayor and city council. 
                  21.1.3.  A quorum of the board of zoning appeals shall consist of four (4) members. 
                  Sec. 21.2. - Proceedings of the board of zoning appeals. 
                  21.2.1.  The board of appeals shall elect a chair and a vice chair from its members who shall serve for one (1) year or until reelected or until their successors are elected. The board shall appoint a secretary, who shall be the city clerk and the deputy city clerk shall serve as the alternate. In the event that neither is available, the board of appeals may appoint a city employee or a member of the board to serve in said capacity. The board shall adopt such rules and bylaws as they deem appropriate. The board shall meet every month or on such schedule as it chooses to adopt, providing there are matters to consider. If there are no agenda items, the regularly scheduled meeting may be cancelled by the chair. 
                  21.2.2.  Meetings of the board shall be held at the call of the chair or in his absence the vice chair and at such other times as the board may determine. The chair, or in his absence, the vice chair, or attorney for the city may administer oaths to witnesses. 
                  21.2.3.  The board shall keep minutes of its proceedings, showing the vote of each member upon each question, or if absent or failing to vote, indicating such fact, and shall keep records of its examinations and other official actions, all of which shall be immediately filed in the office of the board and may be a public record. 
                  21.2.4.  All meetings of the board of appeals shall be open to the public. 
                  Sec. 21.3. - Powers and duties of the board of zoning appeals. 
                  The board of zoning appeals shall have the following powers and duties: 
                  21.3.1.  Appeals. To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by the zoning administrator in the enforcement of this chapter. Appeals to the board of appeals may be taken by any person aggrieved or by any officer, department, board, or agency of the City of Cartersville affected by any decision of the zoning administrator. Such appeal shall be taken within thirty (30) days of said decision by filing with the zoning administrator a written notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. Decisions on appeals shall be issued in writing within ten (10) business days of the hearing on the appeal. 
                  21.3.2.  Continuance of a nonconforming use. The board of zoning appeals may allow a nonconforming use to be reestablished after discontinuance for twelve (12) consecutive months. The procedure for the request shall be the same as if it was a variance. If it is deemed by the board of zoning appeals that one (1) or more of the following apply, the board may grant said request. 
                  A.  The design, construction, and character of the building is not suitable for uses permitted in the district in which the nonconforming use is situated; and 
                  B.  Undue hardships to the property owner would result in not allowing the building to be reopened for a nonconforming use; and 
                  C.  Adjacent property would not be unduly damaged by such use of the building; and 
                  D.  The use is to be identical or similar to the prior nonconforming use of the building. 
                  21.3.3.  Variances. The board of appeals has the power to hear requests for variances from the provisions of this chapter. Variance may be granted only if the board finds all of the following to exist: 
                  A.  That one (1) of the following is true, through no action or fault of the property owner or predecessor: 
                  1.  The property is exceptionally narrow, shallow or unusually shaped; 
                  2.  The property contains exceptional topographic conditions; 
                  3.  The property contains other extraordinary or exceptional conditions; or 
                  4.  There are existing other extraordinary or exceptional circumstances; and 
                  B.  That the strict application of the requirements of this chapter would result in practical difficulties to, or undue hardship upon, the owner of this property; and 
                  C.  That the requested variance relief may be granted without substantially impairing the intent and purpose of this chapter. 
                  Variance decisions shall be issued in writing within ten (10) business days of the hearing. 
                  21.3.4.  Conditions. In granting a variance, the board of appeals may attach such conditions regarding the location, character and other features of the proposed building, structure, property, development standards or use as it may deem advisable so that the purpose of this chapter will be served, public safety and welfare secured and substantial justice done. 
                  21.3.5.  Limitations on variances; improper variance requests. Variances cannot be given to totally remove a requirement or to exempt a property or applicant entirely from a requirement. If a variance is being sought that is, in the judgment of the zoning administrator, a request that would constitute a text amendment, then the application shall not be accepted. The applicant shall instead be directed to file for a text amendment. Furthermore, the board of appeals shall not be authorized to grant a density variance or a use variance to permit a use in a district in which the use is prohibited. A variance application shall not be accepted if the variance seeks something that cannot be varied. A variance application shall not be accepted if the variance is contradictory to the ordinance. 
                  21.3.6.  Self-inflicted hardship. The board shall not grant variances when the hardship was created by the property owner or his predecessor, and shall not grant hardship variances based on shape or topography for lots of record not existing prior to November 7, 1996. Configuring a subdivision to create lots that are difficult to build is an example of a hardship created by the property owner or predecessor, that does not justify a variance. 
                  21.3.7.  Place of worship. In compliance with federal law, if the variance is requested by a place of worship or church, in connection with the exercise of religion, the board shall additionally consider whether the regulation imposes a substantial burden on the exercise of religion, whether the regulation serves a compelling governmental interest, whether the denial is the least restrictive means to serve that interest, or whether the variance can be granted without harming that interest. 
                  21.3.8.  Group homes. If the variance is related to a group home for persons with a disability, the board shall additionally consider what reasonable accommodations in this chapter can be made to provide persons with a disability equal opportunities to use and enjoy dwellings, while not abrogating the purposes of this chapter. Any reasonable accommodation should only relate to the disability. 
                  Sec. 21.4. - Applications, hearing and notice. 
                  21.4.1.  Applications. Applications for appeals or variances must be filed in accordance with the schedule set out by the zoning administrator. The contents of the application shall be determined by the zoning administrator. The filing requirements for information are mandatory unless the requirement is deleted by the zoning administrator. The zoning administrator shall forthwith transmit to the board all documents constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. Variances may be sought by filing an application on forms provided by the zoning administrator. At a minimum, the application shall include the following:

                  1.  If the variance is for a development standard for the property's then zoning district or access requirements of the City of Cartersville development regulations, then said variance shall be indicated on the survey as being requested for the variance being applied for. 
                  C.  The zoning classification of the property. 
                  D.  A brief description of the variance request.

                  An appeal stays all legal proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the zoning administrator certifies to the board of appeals after the notice of appeal shall have been filed with him, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would in his opinion cause imminent peril to life and property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a stay granted by the board of appeals or by a restraining order issued by a court of record on application, on notice to the zoning administrator, and for due cause shown.

                  Sec. 22.1. - Initiation of amendments. 
                  22.1.1.  Text amendment. An application to amend the text of this chapter may be initiated by the planning commission or be submitted to the planning commission by the mayor and city council, zoning staff, or by any person having an interest in the city. 
                  22.1.2.  Map amendment. An application to amend the official zoning map may be initiated by the planning commission or be submitted to the planning commission by the mayor and city council or zoning staff, property owner or agent of the owner. Unless initiated by the mayor and city council, the planning commission or zoning staff, all applications to amend the official zoning map must be submitted by an owner of the affected property or an authorized agent of an owner, following procedures set forth in sections 22.2 and 22.3. If submitted by an agent of the owner, such authorization shall be notarized and attached to the application. If a property has multiple owners, only one (1) owner need file the application, and it will be assumed that the other owners consent; however, if any owner does not consent to the application (or otherwise objects), the rezoning application will not go forward. If owned by a corporation or other entity, the application must be filed by a person with proper corporate or entity authority, and the zoning administrator may require documentation to support a claim of authority. 
                  22.1.3.  Resubmission after denial. In the event an application for an amendment to the zoning map has been denied, another rezoning application affecting the same property shall not be submitted nor accepted until twelve (12) months have passed from the date of the final decision by the mayor and city council. The mayor and city council may either waive or reduce the twelve-month time interval by resolution, to a minimum of six (6) months. 
                  22.1.4.  Alter conditions. An application to alter conditions of rezoning may be submitted at any time after the final decision of the mayor and city council.

Another application to alter the same condition shall not be submitted more than once every twelve (12) months, such interval to begin on the date of the final decision by the mayor and city council on said application to amend the condition. 
                  22.1.5.  Withdrawal. An application may be withdrawn without prejudice at any time prior to 6:00 p.m. on the day of the planning commission hearing. The planning commission may give permission for a withdrawal without prejudice at its hearing.

Applicants and opponents to rezoning actions that change the zoning district on a parcel are requested to consult the Conflict of Interest in Zoning Act, O.C.G.A. § 36-67A-1, which requires disclosure of campaign contributions made within two (2) years of the rezoning application, and aggregating two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) or more, to any planning commission member or any member of the mayor and city council. Such disclosures should be filed at least five (5) calendar days prior to the planning commission's hearing on forms available at the zoning office.
