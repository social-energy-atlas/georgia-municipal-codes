         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Demorest, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1955 Code and ordinances adopted by the City Council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1955 Code and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Senior Code Attorney, and Kyle S. Meyer, Jr., Legal Tech/Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to City Attorney David Burroughs and City Clerk Juanita Crumley for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the City readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the City's affairs.

                  (1)  Where the application is made on behalf of a corporation, the license shall be issued jointly to the corporation and an officer or agent who meets the requirements as set forth in this subsection. The officer or agent named as the applicant shall be an individual who does, in fact, have regular managerial authority over the business conducted on the licensed premises, including the sale of alcoholic beverages, who is employed full-time by the corporation.

This person must be a resident of the city. The licensee shall file the name of such agent, along with the written, notarized consent of such agent with the city manager in such form as he may prescribe.

                  (7)  The written application for the license shall be a permanent record which the licensee must maintain current as required by this chapter. Failure to maintain a current application shall be grounds for revocation of the license.

It shall be the duty of the licensee to report to the council, within five days, any change in any interest in such licensee's business, including, but not limited to, any division of the profits, division of net or gross sales for any purpose whatsoever, change in the payment of rents or leases, change in the ownership of any lease or building or land used in such business, or change in the ownership of any corporation that has any interest in such business or the change of management of such corporation. 
                  (1)  After receipt of such notice, the council shall notify such person within a reasonable time of any objection to the ownership or interest set forth therein, and it shall then be incumbent upon such person to dispose of such interest within 30 days after the mailing of the notice to do so by the council to such person at his address as shown on such notice of interest. In the event such interest is not disposed of within 30 days after the mailing of the notice by the council, or in the event no objection is filed within such 30-day period, or in the event such person fails to notify the council of the transfer of any such interest within 20 days after the acquisition thereof, then the license, as provided for herein, may be revoked by the council until disposition of the interest has been made or notice given to the council of the transfer. 
                  (2)  The report required by this section shall be in the form required by the council and shall be an amendment to the licensee's permanent license application on file with the council and as such shall be under oath and verified as otherwise required of license applications. 
                  (d)  The license issued shall be valid only for the calendar year indicated thereon.

                  (2)  Any person who has been convicted under any federal, state, or local law of any felony involving moral turpitude.

                  (4)  Any person who has been convicted under any federal, state, or local law of a misdemeanor, particularly, but not limited to, those involving alcoholic beverages, gambling, or tax law violations, if such conviction tends to indicate that the applicant will not maintain the operation for which he is seeking a license in conformity with federal, state, local laws, rules and regulations. 
                  (5)  A location not suitable in the judgment and discretion of the city council because of traffic congestion, general character of the neighborhood, or by reason of the effect which such an establishment would have on the adjacent and surrounding properties or on the neighborhood. 
                  (6)  A location within an area where, in the judgment of the city council, the number of alcoholic beverages licenses already granted makes it contrary to the public interest or welfare. 
                  (7)  Any location prohibited by any applicable zoning codes. 
                  (8)  A location at which a previous alcoholic beverage license has been revoked or suspended, and where, in the judgment of the city council, the problems which have arisen from the operation of an alcoholic beverage license at such location indicate that it is not in the interest of the public health, safety, welfare, or morals that the sale of alcoholic beverages be permitted at such location. 
                  (9)  Which the granting of such license would constitute a violation of state law or regulations.

                  (h)  Before the city council shall deny any application for a license or for the transfer of any license, or shall revoke any existing license, the applicant or licensee, as the case may be, shall be given notice in writing from the city manager to show cause before the city council at a time and place specified therein not less than three days nor more than ten days from the date of service of the above notice, why such application for a license or for transfer of a license should not be denied, or why such license should not be revoked, as the case may be, stating the grounds thereof, and at the appointed time and place the applicant or licensee shall have an opportunity to show cause, if any exist, why such application should not be denied or such license revoked, after which the city council shall take such action as it, in its judgment and discretion, shall deem warranted under the facts. The hearing herein provided for need not be at a regular meeting of the city council but may be at such time and place as shall be fixed in such notice. All decisions, denying, approving, suspending, or revoking any permit, license, or application shall be in writing with the reasons thereof stated and mailed or delivered to the applicant. In addition, at any hearing as provided herein, the party afforded the hearing shall have the opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.

                  (a)  The fire chief shall conduct yearly fire safety inspections of all new public buildings, existing public buildings, buildings which present a special hazard to persons, or property within the territorial limits of the city. The inspection of private residences shall be exempt from said fire safety inspections except as follows:

                  (2)  Fire, safety, and health inspections of private residences may be conducted at the request of the city council if due cause is shown that the residential structure may be in such condition as might pose a serious threat to the health or safety of the owner or occupant of said residential structure. In the event that this fire, safety, and health inspection reveals deficiencies which might cause a serious fire, safety, or health threat to the owner or occupant, the owner, occupant, or both of said residential structure shall be required to bring said structure into compliance with fire, safety, and health codes within the prescribed time frame. 
                  (b)  In the event that fire safety code violations are noted during the yearly inspection of existing public buildings, during the inspection of newly built public buildings or remodeled or altered existing public buildings, the fire chief shall give the owner of said building 90 days to correct noted violations; this 90-day period may be reduced at the discretion of the fire chief if the violations noted impose an eminent life safety hazard to the public. At the end of the prescribed timeframe, the fire chief shall return to the structure and conduct a follow-up inspection. This follow-up inspection shall consist of the inspection of the violations noted during the earlier inspection to verify the correction of said violations.

                  Secs. 18-1—18-20. - Reserved. 
                  ARTICLE II. - ADULT ESTABLISHMENTS 

                  Sec. 18-21. - Purpose. 
                  The purpose of this article is to regulate certain types of businesses, which can collectively be described as adult entertainment establishments to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses will be curtailed. However, it is recognized that such regulation cannot de facto approach prohibition. Otherwise, a protected form of expression would vanish. As to adult dance establishments, this article represents a balancing of competing interests: reduced criminal activity and protection of neighborhoods through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments versus the protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons.

                  ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

                  Sec. 22-1. - Statutory authorization. 
                  Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and Section 36-1-20(a) of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the city council of the City of Demorest, Georgia, does ordain as follows. 
                  (Ord. No. 2010-04, § 1(Art. I, § A), 8-3-2010) 
                  Sec. 22-2. - Findings of fact. 
                  (a)  The flood hazard areas of the City of Demorest, Georgia are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (b)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
                  (Ord. No. 2010-04, § 1(Art. 1, § B), 8-3-2010) 
                  Sec. 22-3. - Statement of purpose. 
                  It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
                  (4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and 
                  (5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.

                  (3)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas, 
                  (4)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
                  (5)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
                  (6)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; and 
                  (7)  To insure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

                  Sec. 22-11. - Warning and disclaimer of liability.

                  Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. (Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (NOTE: accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance requirements) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
                  Subdivision the division of a single lot into two or more lots for the purpose of sale or development. 
                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
                  Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the "start of construction" of the improvement. NOTE: The market value of the structure should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
                  For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include (1) those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the Code Enforcement Official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project, or (2) any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure". 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. 
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this ordinance is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  b.  Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
                  1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or 
                  2.  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
                  c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (Ref. subsection 22-51(4)a. above). 
                  d.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
                  1.  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days. 
                  2.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions); or 
                  3.  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "new construction," including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsection 22-52(3)a.—c., above. 
                  (4)  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 22-6, are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. 
                  Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
                  (b)  Only if subsection 22-52(4)a. above is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Article III of this chapter.

                  Sec. 22-53. - Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodway (A-zones). 
                  Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 22-6, where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A-zones), or where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 22-6, then the administrative officer shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of Article III of this chapter. ONLY if data are not available from these sources, then the following provisions (2) and (3) shall apply: 
                  (2)  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 20 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in more than a one-foot increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
                  (3)  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. (NOTE: Require the lowest floor to be elevated one foot above the estimated base flood elevation in A-zone areas where a limited detail study has been completed). Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 22-51(4) "elevated buildings." 
                  a.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site.

                  Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 22-6, where streams with base flood elevations are provided but no floodways have been designated, (zones AE) the following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  No encroachments, including fill material, new structures or substantial improvements shall be located within areas of special flood hazard, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community. The engineering certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles. 
                  (2)  New construction or substantial improvements of buildings shall be elevated or flood-proofed to elevations established in accordance with section 22-52.

                  Areas of special flood hazard established in section 22-6, may include designated "AO" shallow flooding areas. These areas have base flood depths of one to three feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. The following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and non-residential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 22-51(4), "elevated buildings". 
                  The administrative officer shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
                  (2)  New construction or the substantial improvement of a non-residential structure may be flood-proofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to the specified FIRM flood level plus one (1) foot, above highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and as required in subsection 22-32(b)(1)c. and subsection 22-32(b)(2). 
                  (3)  Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure.

                  Sec. 22-71. - Requests for variances and appeals. 
                  (a)  The city council shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this chapter, after recommendation from the planning commission. 
                  (b)  The city council shall hear and decide appeals, after recommendation from the planning commission when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the administrative officer in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. 
                  (c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the city council may appeal such decision to the Superior Court of Habersham County, as provided in Section 5-4-1 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated. 
                  (d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a Historic Structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if ANY increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (g)  In reviewing such requests, the planning commission and the city council shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this chapter. 
                  (h)  Conditions for variances: 
                  (a)  A variance shall be issued ONLY when there is: 
                  a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
                  b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  (2)  The provisions of this chapter are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of a Historic Structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (4)  The administrative officer shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (i)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this chapter, the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

                  3.  Is the proposed use compatible with the purpose and intent of the comprehensive plan? 
                  4.  Are there substantial reasons why the property cannot or should not be used as currently zoned? 
                  5.  Will the proposed use cause an excessive or burdensome use of public facilities or services, including, but not limited to, streets, schools, water or sewer utilities, and police or fire protection? 
                  6.  Is the proposed use supported by new or changing conditions not anticipated by the comprehensive plan or reflected in the existing performance district on the property or surrounding properties? 
                  7.  Does the proposed use reflect a reasonable balance between the promotion of the public health, safety, morality, or general welfare and the right to unrestricted use of property? 
                  8.  The extent to which the property values are diminished by the existing zoning restrictions. 
                  9.  The relative gain to the public as compared to the hardship imposed upon the individual property owner. 
                  10.  The length of time the property has been vacant as zoned, considered in the context of land development in the area in the vicinity of the property. 
                  11.  Whether the change would create an isolated district unrelated to the surrounding districts, such as "spot zoning." 
                  12.  Whether the present zoning district boundaries are illogically drawn in relation to existing conditions in the area. 
                  13.  Whether the change requested is out of scale with the needs of the city as a whole or the immediate neighborhood. 
                  14.  Whether it is impossible to find adequate sites for the proposed use in districts permitting such use and already appropriately zoned. 
                  15.  Whether the need for rezoning could be handled instead by a variance request to the city council. 
                  16.  Whether there would be an ecological or pollution impact resulting from major modifications to the land if the request is granted. 
                  17.  Whether there is reasonable evidence based upon existing and anticipated land use that would indicate a mistake was made in the original zoning of the property. 
                  m.  Developments of regional impact . 
                  1.  Any application that would result in a performance district amendment that meets or exceeds the currently approved thresholds established by the Georgia Mountains Regional Development Center (GMRDC) shall be considered a development of regional impact (DRI).

                  (3)  If notice has been published (or is irretrievably set for publication) but the application has not been heard by the city council, the application shall be withdrawn administratively by the city council, and an application for a variance on the property may not be resubmitted for six months from the date of withdrawal. 
                  (4)  If the request for withdrawal is made at the city council's public hearing on the case, the request may be approved by a majority vote of the city council, but an application for a variance on the property may not be resubmitted for six months from the date of withdrawal. 
                  (5)  If the withdrawal is approved pursuant to subsections (h)(3) or (h)(4) of this section, the city council may reduce the waiting period for reconsideration but only in the same manner and under the same circumstances as set forth in subsection (c) of this section. 
                  (i)  Effect. 
                  (1)  Approval of a variance on a property located within the city shall be in full force and effect upon its approval by the city council. 
                  (2)  A variance request approved by the city council on a property located within the city shall be effective for a period of 12 months. If no substantial step has been taken by the applicant to implement the variance within 12 months from the date of approval, said approval shall become null and void.

                  Sec. 30-38. - Nonconforming uses. 
                  (a)  Purpose . Invariably, at the time an ordinance is adopted or amended, land uses which existed prior to the adoption or amendment will not conform to the use standards or requirements for the particular district. These are known as nonconforming uses, and in order to feasibly adopt an ordinance and so as not to cause undue economic hardship on owners of nonconforming uses, these uses are allowed to continue under the requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of this section. The purpose of this section is to provide for the continuation of a nonconforming structure or use, change of a nonconforming structure, and change of a nonconforming use. 
                  (b)  Continuation of a nonconforming structure or use. Subject to the provisions of this section, a nonconforming structure or use may be continued and maintained in reasonable repair, but shall not be altered or extended. The extension of a nonconforming use to a portion of a structure which was arranged or designed for the nonconforming use at the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived is not considered an enlargement or expansion of a nonconforming use. Alterations or extensions of a nonconforming use may be allowed when the administrative officer determines that such alterations or extensions are necessary to comply with other city, state or federal requirements. 
                  (c)  Change of a nonconforming structure or use. 
                  (1)  Except for signs, a structure conforming as to use but nonconforming as to height, yard requirements, or lot coverage may be altered or extended provided the alteration or extension does not exceed the area, height, or coverage requirements of this chapter. A nonconforming sign shall not be altered or extended except to make it comply with the requirements of this chapter. 
                  (2)  If a nonconforming use involving a structure is replaced by another use, the new use shall conform to this chapter. 
                  (3)  If a nonconforming use involving a residential structure is changed to another residential use, the new use shall be of the same type (i.e. a single-family use can only be changed to another single-family use; a multifamily use can only be changed to another multifamily use, etc.). 
                  (Land Use Ord. of 8-1984, §§ 1500—1502) 
                  Sec. 30-39. - Land use ordinance district map. 
                  (a)  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to: 
                  (1)  Establish the land use ordinance district map and provide for identification, alteration, and replacement of the district map; and 
                  (2)  Establish criteria to be considered in amending the district map, district boundaries, relationship between district map and future land use map, and newly annexed areas. 
                  (b)  Designation; references to district map. The land use ordinance district map is hereby designated to be section 30-39. Any reference to the "district map" in this article refers to the official land use ordinance district map. 
                  (c)  Identification, alteration, and replacement of the district map. 
                  (1)  The district map is signed by the mayor, with witnessing signature of the city clerk, and bears the seal of the city under the following words: "This certifies that this is the land use ordinance district map referred to in section 30-39 of the Code of the City of Demorest, Georgia," together with the date of the adoption of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived. 
                  (2)  The district map may be altered only if the proposed alterations are in conformance with the future land use map, and sound planning principles. Any alteration to the district map is an amendment to this section, and the procedures applicable to text amendments shall be applicable to such amendments. Any amendment involving changes in performance district boundaries must be entered on the district map as soon as the amendment has been approved by the city council. The entry should be as follows: "On (date) by official action of the city council, the following change (or changes) were made on the official land use ordinance district map: (brief description of change)." It should be signed by the mayor, with witnessing signature of the city clerk. No amendment to portions of this section that are illustrated on the district map becomes effective until after the change has been entered as described above on the district map. Any unauthorized alteration of the district map by any person is a violation of this section. The official land use ordinance district map is located at city hall and is the final authority as to the current status of performance district boundaries. 
                  (3)  If the district map becomes damaged, destroyed, lost, or difficult to interpret because of the nature or number of changes and additions, the city council may adopt a new district map which will replace the previous district map. The new district map is identified as such in the same manner as described above. When the new district map is adopted, a notation should be made on the previous district map that it is no longer valid, indicating the date that the new district map was adopted, as a reference aid. The previous district map should be preserved, if it has not been lost or destroyed, for possible future reference. 
                  (d)  District boundaries. Where uncertainty exists with respect to the exact location of the boundary of a performance district shown on the district map, the following guidelines should be followed in establishing the exact location of the boundary: 
                  (1)  Where a performance district boundary is indicated as approximately following the centerline of a street or road, or as approximately following the right-of-way line, that line should be considered to be the boundary. 
                  (2)  Where a performance district boundary is indicated as approximately following the corporate limit line of the city, the corporate limit line should be considered to be the boundary. 
                  (3)  Where a performance district boundary is indicated as approximately following a property line or such line extended, the line extended should be considered to be the boundary. 
                  (4)  Where a performance district boundary is indicated approximately following the center of a streambed, such should be considered to be the boundary. 
                  (5)  Where a performance district boundary is indicated as approximately parallel to the centerline of a street, road, railroad, or the right-of-way of such a facility, such boundary shall be interpreted to be parallel to such line and at a distance from it as indicated by scale on the district map. 
                  (6)  Where a performance district boundary line is indicated as dividing a lot in single ownership at the time of the enactment the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, the performance standards for the performance district in which the greater portion of the lot lines must be extended to the balance of the lot up to a distance of 35 feet beyond the actual boundary line of the performance district. 
                  (e)  Relationship between district map and future land use map. 
                  (1)  The future land use map is prepared by the planning commission and adopted by the city council. It should provide the best possible indication of desirable future land use patterns that will meet projected future demand for land uses of various types. It indicates actual land uses rather than land use intensities or performance districts. Existing land uses need not conform to the future land use map. 
                  (2)  The performance districts contained on the district map carry standards which must be met by all new development and construction in the city. The arrangement of performance districts is based on land use projections depicted on the future land use map. Establishment and amendments of performance district boundaries must be based on defensible findings of fact as well as sound comprehensive planning principles. 
                  (f)  Land use ordinance district map. The city's land use ordinance district map shall be a part of this section. The map shall be located in city hall. 
                  (Land Use Ord. of 8-1984, §§ 1600—1602, 1604, 1605, 1607; Ord. of 7-6-2004, §§ XIX, XXI; Ord. of 3-1-2005(02), § III) 
                  Sec. 30-40. - Future land use map. 
                  (a)  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide for a future land use map, background concepts of the future land use map, identification, alteration, and replacement of the future land use map, and criteria to be considered in amending the future land use map. 
                  (b)  Background concepts of the future land use map. The future land use map represents a synthesis of data concerning population, land use patterns, and economic activity, etc. The planning commission has studied these data and conceived a set of goals to provide suitable space for anticipated future development while the public health, safety, and welfare is protected. The map contains an arrangement of land uses which permits minimum adverse impact on neighboring land uses and on safety conditions, while maximum efficiency in providing community and utility services is achieved. The land uses illustrated on the future land use map represent the planning commission's projection of how land use patterns in the city should look in the medium to long-range future. The performance standards and other requirements contained in this section are intended to encourage the development of the land use patterns depicted on the future land use map. Existing and future land uses are not regulated or controlled by the future land use map as they are by the district map. 
                  (c)  Identification, alteration, and replacement of the future land use map. 
                  (1)  The future land use map is signed by the mayor, with witnessing signature of the city clerk, and bears the seal of the city or that of a notary public under the following words: "This certifies that this is the Demorest Future Land Use Map referred to in section 30-40 of the Code of the City of Demorest, Georgia," together with the date of the adoption of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived. 
                  (2)  The future land use map may be altered only if the proposed alterations are in conformance with sound comprehensive planning principles. Any alteration to the future land use map is an amendment to this section. 
                  (3)  The procedure by which amendments are proposed and approved is contained in section 30-36. Any amendment to the future land use map must be entered on that map as soon as the amendment has been approved by the city council. The entry should be as follows: "On (date), by official action of the city council, the following change (or changes) were made in the Demorest Future Land Use Map: (Brief description of change)." It should be signed by the mayor with the witnessing signature of the city clerk. No amendment to the future land use map becomes effective until after the change and only by the procedures contained in this section. Any unauthorized alteration of the future land use map is a violation of this section. 
                  (4)  The future land use map is located in city hall. If it becomes damaged, destroyed, lost, or difficult to interpret because of the nature of number of changes or additions, the city council may adopt a new future land use map, which will replace the previous identified as such in the same manner as described above in this section. When the new future land use map is adopted, a notation should be made on the previous future land use map that it is no longer valid, indicating the date that the new future land use map was adopted as a reference aid. The previous future land use map should be preserved, if it has not been lost or destroyed, for possible future reference. 
                  (d)  Criteria to be considered in amending the future land use map. In determining whether or not a proposed amendment satisfactorily addresses the points stated below, sound planning principles should be adhered to (discussions with professional staff would be useful). The following points should be addressed when considering proposed amendments to the future land use map: 
                  (1)  Findings of fact must be presented and accepted in support of the proposed amendment. 
                  (2)  The proposed amendment should meet demonstrated changes in community needs. 
                  (3)  The proposed amendment should be consistent with indications of current available population, economic, and land use data upon which information depicted on the future land use map is based. 
                  (e)  Future land use map. The future land use map shall be a part of this article. The map shall be located in the city hall.

                  Sec. 30-67. - Purpose. 
                  The purpose of this article is to establish and explain performance districts used in this chapter, and to divide the city into performance districts.

                  For the purpose of this article, the city is divided into performance districts as follows: 
                  (1)  Low-intensity (LI) performance district. 
                  (2)  Moderate-intensity (MI) performance district. 
                  (3)  High-intensity (HI) performance district. 
                  (4)  Sensitive land (SL) performance district.

                  Sec. 30-69. - Performance districts explained. 
                  (a)  Performance districts are areas of land within the city which have different performance standards based on maximum lot coverage and minimum open area. Within each district certain land uses may be required to meet buffer and/or screening requirements or conditional use requirements, intended to promote the separation of incompatible uses and retain the character of the community. These standards and requirements allow for the flexibility of mixed land uses (i.e., residential, commercial, industrial) to exist within the same district. 
                  (b)  Although this article establishes the locations of district boundaries as indicated on the city's land use ordinance district map (district map), the boundaries may be amended in the future in order to meet changing needs, if evidence is presented and accepted in support of such an amendment. This may be done, however, only if the proposed change is in conformance with the city's future land use map. If conditions have changed to the point that a genuinely needed change in a district boundary is not in conformance with the future land use map, then the future land use map must first be amended to address the changing needs. After such action, the proposed amendment to the district boundary of the district map will no longer be in conflict with the future land use map, both will have been kept up-to-date to address current and projected future needs. 
                  (c)  In making the decision to amend the boundary of a performance district, the points contained in section 30-40 must be considered by the planning commission and the city council.

                  This section provides a matrix of allowable, conditional, and prohibited uses within the city. 

                   
                  O = Outright use 
                  C = Conditional use 
                  P = Prohibited 
                  Prohibited uses within the city shall be as listed in section 30-136.

                  Sec. 30-71. - Low-intensity (LI) performance districts. 
                  (a)  Purpose . The purpose of this section is to establish low-intensity (LI) performance districts by defining low-intensity performance districts, features which make land suitable for low-intensity use, permitted uses, and performance standards for low-intensity districts. 
                  (b)  Low-intensity (LI) performance districts defined . Low-intensity performance districts encompass areas with large, undeveloped tracts of land where full city services are not available. Low-intensity districts can include residential and agricultural activities as well as forested areas. It is anticipated that these areas may become more intensely developed in the medium to long-range future as the city grows. At present, however, development will be at a low-intensity level as reflected in the performance standards for low-intensity performance districts. 
                  (c)  Features which make land suitable for low-intensity use . 
                  (1)  Land is best suited for, or is being used for such activities as agriculture, forest management, or residential development. 
                  (2)  Land is away from developed areas of the city. Such lands may be developed in the future, but are outside of existing developed areas. 
                  (d)  Permitted uses . 
                  (1)  Outright uses . The following uses are permitted in a low-intensity (LI) district as long as the requirements of the performance standards are met:

                  b.  Agricultural. 
                  c.  Forest management. 
                  (2)  Conditional uses . Other uses may be permitted in a low-intensity (LI) district as allowed in the use matrix, which appears in section 30-70. 
                  (3)  Amendment of this section. If there is demonstrated and accepted in the future a need to permit other land use activities to be located in a low-intensity district, this section may be amended as provided in section 30-36. 
                  (e)  Performance standards for low-intensity districts . 
                  (1)  Maximum lot coverage. 
                  a.  Residential uses: 30 percent. 
                  b.  Commercial, industrial or other nonresidential uses: 30 percent. 
                  (2)  Minimum open area. 
                  a.  Residential uses: 70 percent. 
                  b.  Commercial, industrial, or other nonresidential uses: 70 percent.

                  (a)  Purpose . The purpose of this section is to establish moderate-intensity (MI) performance districts by defining moderate-intensity performance districts, features which make land suitable for moderate-intensity use, permitted uses, and performance standards for moderate-intensity districts. 
                  (b)  Moderate-intensity (MI) performance districts defined . Moderate-intensity performance districts are intended to provide land area for uses between low- and high-intensity uses, while allowing for flexibility of development. 
                  (c)  Features which make land suitable for moderate-intensity use . 
                  (1)  Land should already be served by public services and utilities, including adequate sewer and water capacity for the density or intensity of development proposed. 
                  (2)  There should be an adequate street system in the area. 
                  (3)  The use of the land for moderate-intensity use should not impose foreseeable adverse impacts on adjacent land uses, such as residential areas, public recreation areas, schools, historic or scenic areas. 
                  (4)  The proximity of the land to developed areas, such as existing moderate- or high-intensity districts should be considered as it relates to each individual case. 
                  (d)  Permitted uses . 
                  (1)  Outright uses . Residential uses are permitted in a moderate-intensity (MI) district as long as the requirements of the performance standards are met. 
                  (2)  Conditional uses. Other uses may be permitted in a moderate-intensity (MI) district as allowed in the use matrix, which appears in section 30-70. 
                  (3)  Amendment of this section. If there is demonstrated and accepted in the future a need to permit other land use activities to be located in a moderate-intensity district, this section may be amended as provided in section 30-36. 
                  (e)  Performance standards for moderate-intensity districts . 
                  (1)  Maximum lot coverage : 
                  a.  Residential uses: 50 percent. 
                  b.  Commercial, industrial or other nonresidential uses: 50 percent. 
                  (2)  Minimum open area: 
                  a.  Residential uses: 50 percent. 
                  b.  Commercial, industrial or other nonresidential uses: 50 percent. 
                  (3)  Minimum landscaped open area . A minimum of ten percent of the total lot area of a commercial, industrial or other nonresidential use shall be maintained in a landscaped open area located on the street side or in front of the use.

                  (a)  Purpose . The purpose of this section is to establish high-intensity (HI) performance districts by defining high-intensity performance districts, features which make land suitable for high-intensity use, permitted uses, and performance standards for high-intensity districts. 
                  (b)  High-intensity (HI) performance districts defined . High-intensity performance districts are intended to provide areas of land in which intensive types of activities can take place. These include, but are not limited to, commercial, industrial, higher density residential, intensive commercial recreation, and similar types of activities where intense use activities can be carried out. 
                  (c)  Features which make land suitable for high-intensity use . 
                  (1)  Land should be free from steep slopes, floodplains, and wetlands. It should not be valuable for resource purposes such as timber, agriculture, and scenic value. 
                  (2)  Land should be accessible from major roads, such as U.S. Highway 441. 
                  (3)  The use of the land for high-intensity use should not impose foreseeable adverse impacts on adjacent land uses such as residential areas, public recreation areas, schools, and historic or scenic areas. 
                  (4)  The proximity of the land to existing high-intensity uses, such as commercial, industrial and high-intensity residential developments should be considered as it relates to each individual case. 
                  (d)  Permitted uses . 
                  (1)  Outright uses . The following uses are permitted in a high-intensity (HI) district as long as the requirements of the performance standards are met:

                  Sec. 30-74. - Sensitive land (SL) performance districts. 
                  (a)  Purpose . The purpose of this section is to establish sensitive land (SL) performance districts by defining sensitive land performance districts, features which make land suitable for sensitive land use, permitted uses, and performance standards for sensitive land districts. 
                  (b)  S ensitive land (SL) performance districts defined . Sensitive land performance districts are intended to prevent hazards and threats to life and property created by flooding, landslides, weak foundation soils, and other hazards as may be identified and mapped by the city or other agency. Building hazards exist throughout the other districts of the city, but specific parcels which lie wholly or partially in an area of identified hazards are considered to be in the sensitive land district. It is the intent of the standards of this section to protect life and property by reducing building intensity in these areas, by requiring special construction techniques, or by requiring the study of such areas by a qualified person prior to construction. 
                  (c)  Features which make land suitable for sensitive land use . Land is suitable for sensitive land use if development hazards are present on the land, such as wetlands, flooding potential, steep slopes, or unstable soils. 
                  (d)  Determining sensitive lands. Current background or technical information should be examined to determine sensitive lands. These include: 
                  (1)  U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Flood Hazards Map for Demorest. 
                  (2)  Demorest Topographic Map. 
                  (3)  Soil Survey, Habersham County, Georgia; U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service. 
                  (e)  Permitted uses . 
                  (1)  Outright uses . Recreation uses are permitted in a sensitive land (SL) district as long as the requirements of the performance standards are met. 
                  (2)  Conditional uses . Other uses may be permitted in a sensitive land (SL) district as allowed in the use matrix, which appears in section 30-70. 
                  (3)  Amendment of this section. If there is demonstrated and accepted in the future a need to permit other land use activities to be located in a sensitive land district, this section may be amended as provided in section 30-36. 
                  (f)  Performance standards for sensitive land districts . 
                  (1)  The planning commission shall review all planning permit requests for conformance with the standards and criteria of the sensitive land district. The planning commission shall review requests for building permits and/or grading permits, proposed in a sensitive land district. The planning commission may use the advice of the administrative officer or other technically qualified person in reaching their determination on matters requiring use of guidelines, such as slope-density determination. The planning commission may recommend to the city council its approval, denial, or required changes in the proposal based on the criteria of standards of the district. The city council's decision shall be subject to appeal to the county superior court. 
                  (2)  In reviewing applications for subdivisions, planned developments, or multifamily dwellings, the administrative office shall employ the following density guidelines for the property, based on the average slope of the site as determined from the city topographic map or a contour map presented by the applicant: 

                   
                  (3)  Specific density shall be established after deliberation of the planning commission and testimony from the engineering geologist, soils engineer or other qualified person for proper foundation design, stormwater drainage or retention facilities, vegetation necessary for retention, and adequate placement of roads. Any geologic hazards identified shall be noted and taken into consideration. 
                  (4)  The administrative officer may require a site study by an engineering geologist, soils engineer, or other qualified person prior to issuance of a building or excavation permit in areas containing or adjacent to a landslide, sinkhole, or other geologic hazard. Site studies may also be required for construction or excavation in areas of steep slope, where, in the opinion of the engineering geologist, soils engineer, or other qualified person, there is a hazard to the proposed structure or to any adjacent property. 
                  (5)  Site studies may be required by the administrative officer or planning commission for construction or development of property containing weak foundation soils as determined by the Soil Survey of Habersham County Georgia, U.S. Department of Agriculture. Site studies shall include information on the bearing capacity of the soil, adequacy and method of drainage facilities, and length of fill settlement prior to construction. Location and characteristics of weak foundation soils shall be updated as information becomes available. 
                  (6)  For structures, driveways, parking areas or other impervious surfaces in areas of 25 percent slope and greater, the release rate and sedimentation of stormwater shall be controlled by the use of retention facilities as specified by the U.S. Soil and Conservation Service or other qualified agency. The retention facilities shall be designed for storms having a 25-year recurrence frequency. Stormwater shall be directed into drainages with adequate capacity so as not to flood adjacent or downstream property. The U.S. Soil Conservation Service may be used for technical information. 
                  (7)  In all areas of the city, the administrative officer may require adequate culverts or other drainage facilities be installed as a condition of construction. 
                  (8)  Filling of lowlands shall be done only where it is determined that the fill will not cause the flooding of adjacent properties, and adequate drainage facilities are installed.

                  Sec. 30-99. - Single-section manufactured homes (SSMHs) and multisection manufactured homes (MSMHs). 
                  (a)  The following standards apply to all single-section manufactured homes (SSMHs) not located in a manufactured home park: 
                  (1)  Single-section manufactured homes (SSMHs) not located in a manufactured home park shall be owner occupied. The manufactured home owner must also own the land on which the home is to be placed. Renter occupied manufactured homes must be located in a manufactured home park. A manufactured home park is a privately owned place where two or more manufactured homes used for human occupancy are parked on a lot, tract or parcel of land under the same ownership. A manufactured home park may contain either or both single-section and multisection manufactured homes. No two manufactured homes may occupy the same lot, tract or parcel of land under the same ownership. 
                  (2)  No SSMH shall be located within 500 feet of another SSMH. Variances of the 500-foot separation requirement will be considered if it becomes necessary for the better placement of a new structure. 
                  (3)  When a SSMH is placed, evidence in writing that 75 percent of all persons living on property within a one-fourth of a mile radius of the proposed location of the SSMH affirmatively consent and agree to the placing of the SSMH is required. In the event a parcel of land exists within the one-fourth of a mile radius aforementioned which is not occupied, then the owner of the property shall, for the purposes of this article, be deemed an occupant of the land for the purposes of arriving at the percentage of persons consenting. Evidence should consist of signatures on forms provided by the city clerk. 
                  (4)  It is unlawful for any person to construct, alter, or extend any SSMH within the city limits unless he holds a valid building permit issued by the administrative officer, in his name, and for the specific placement, construction, alteration, or extension, erection, movement or enlargement proposed. No permit for MSMH or SSMH placement will be accepted until all signatures required are on the signature form provided by the clerk and attached to the building permit and fees paid. It is the responsibility of the person who wants to place the multisection manufactured home or single-section manufactured home to get the full 75 percent requirement of signatures within the one-fourth of a mile radius. 
                  a.  All adjacent property owners must affirmatively consent to the placement of the multisection or single-section mobile home. Adjacent property owners are those whose property boundaries touch the applicant's property on all sides. Intersections of roads or streets shall not be a cause to separate boundary owners from applicant's property and such roads or streets shall serve only as property lines. 
                  b.  A "temporary" category shall be established to allow for temporary or business reasons. Time allowable shall not exceed six months. No signatures are required, but a permit and administrative officer or planning commission permission is required before placement of the manufactured home. A fee shall be charged for the permit according to the set fee for a building permit and it shall be followed. A decal shall be issued for the temporary period. 
                  c.  Multisection mobile home or single-section mobile home owners wishing to replace their owned MSMH or SSMH with a new home may do so without getting signatures. Those MSMH and SSMH owners will fill out a building permit and pay a fee as in building a new structure. One exception would be that if three complaints have been lodged against the property owner, the property owner will have to get the required signatures as if placing a not previously placed manufactured home. The complaints will be ones which have substance and concern, things that would have constituted a nuisance or disturbance. The discretion of the planning commission will be used in dealing with the complaints and determining if they are permissible in such a manner as to prohibit the replacement of a manufactured home. A decal will also be issued if all the above procedures are in compliance and have been completed fully. If the homeowner is in compliance, the manufactured home that has been replaced shall not be allowed to remain on the property as an additional structure. 
                  d.  Those renting units of a single-section manufactured home or multisection manufactured home existing before the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived and whose owners wish to update their (manufactured home) status to new multisection manufactured home or single-section manufactured home on the site, shall be required to get the 75 percent signatures within one-fourth of a mile radius as well as adjacent property owners. A permit will also be required, and the required fees will be paid before any change in the owner's manufactured home status as a rental unit is undertaken. 
                  (5)  All SSMHs shall be constructed in conformance with state and federal specifications, and shall be placed in conformance with the standards of this chapter. 
                  (6)  The condition of soil, groundwater level, drainage, and ground slope must not create hazards to the property, or to the health or safety of the residents. The SSMH site must not be exposed to objectionable smoke, noise, odors, or other adverse conditions, and no part subject to flooding or erosion can be used for any purpose that exposes people or property to danger. 
                  (7)  Exposed ground surfaces on SSMH sites must be protected with a vegetative growth that prevents soil erosion, standing puddles, or dust. If this is not possible, such areas may be covered with a solid material such as stone, or they may be paved. 
                  (8)  The ground surface of all SSMH sites must be equipped to drain all surface water in a safe, efficient manner, either through grading or installation of drains. 
                  (9)  When an accessory structure with an area of more than 25 square feet is attached to a SSMH or located on the same lot, it must, for purposes of separation requirements, be considered part of the SSMH. 
                  (10)  No roof shall be constructed over a SSMH independent of the structure. Cabanas and awnings may be added if they are compatible in appearance with the main structure, and a building permit is obtained prior to construction. 
                  (11)  Each SSMH must be placed on footings which meet or exceed the following minimum requirements: 
                  a.  Piers must be centered under each main frame (or chassis) member with a maximum spacing of eight feet on centers.

                  c.  Piers less than 36 inches in height above the footings must be constructed of standard eight-inch by 16-inch hollow concrete blocks in a single column with the long dimension of each block perpendicular to the main frame members. The cells of the concrete block must run in a vertical direction. 
                  d.  Piers more than 36 inches in height above the footings must be constructed of two columns eight inches by 16 inches by eight inches hollow concrete blocks with the long dimension of the blocks perpendicular to the lower course. The cells of the concrete blocks must run in a vertical direction. 
                  e.  If a pier footing is located on unconsolidated fill or other unstable soils, the administrative officer may require other types of footings with adequate permanence and weight-bearing ability. 
                  (12)  The area of the SSMH stand must be prepared to provide an adequate foundation for the placement and tiedown of the SSMH, making it secure against uplift, sliding, rotation, and overturning. 
                  a.  The SSMH stand cannot heave, shift or settle unevenly under the weight of the SSMH due to frost action, inadequate drainage, vibration, or other forces. 
                  b.  The SSMH stand must have anchors and tiedowns such as cast-in-place concrete "dead men," eyelets imbedded in concrete foundations or runways, screw augers, arrowhead anchors, or other devices to stabilize the SSMH. 
                  c.  Anchors and tiedowns must be placed at least at each corner of the SSMH stand, and each must be able to sustain a minimum tensile strength of 3,000 pounds. The tiedown anchorage requirements for different sizes of SSMHs are shown in the following table.

                  (11)  Access to SSMH parks must be designed to minimize congestion and hazards at the entrance and exit and allow free movement of traffic on adjacent streets. The pavement width of the entrance road connecting the park streets with a public road must be at least 24 feet wide (no parking). The city administrative officer will determine, as per design, the most efficient, safe and healthful entryway into the park. (See Appendix B). 
                  (12)  Surfaced roadways must be wide enough to accommodate traffic. In any case they must meet the following minimum requirements: 
                  a.  All streets with space for parking: 30 feet. 
                  b.  Minor streets, no parking: 24 feet. 
                  c.  One-way streets, no parking: 12 feet.

                  (31)  All refuse must be kept in fly-proof, water-proof, rodent-proof containers, which must be located not more than 150 feet from any SSMH lot. Enough containers must be provided to properly store all household refuse. 
                  (32)  All refuse containing garbage must be collected at least once weekly. Where suitable collection service is not available from municipal or private agencies, the SSMH park operator must provide this service. All refuse must be collected and transported in covered vehicles or covered containers. 
                  (33)  Natural gas piping systems must be installed and maintained in accordance with applicable codes and regulations governing such systems. 
                  (34)  Each SSMH lot provided with piped gas must have an approved manual shutoff valve installed upstream of the gas outlet. The outlet should be equipped with an approved cap or prevent accidental discharge of gas when the outlet is not in use. 
                  (35)  Cooking shelters, barbecue pits, fireplaces, wood-burning stoves, and incinerators should be located, constructed, maintained, and used in a way that minimizes fire hazards and smoke nuisance both on the property on which it is used and on neighboring property. Open fires are permitted only in facilities provided. No open fires should be left unattended. No fuel should be used and no material burned which gives off dense smoke or objectionable odors. 
                  (36)  No part of this section prohibits the sale of a SSMH located on a mobile home stand and connected to the utilities. 
                  (37)  All SSMH parks must have an overall average density of four units per acre or less. This allows flexibility in site design while assuring that adequate open space is maintained. 
                  (38)  All SSMHs must be located at least 15 feet from all boundary lines of the SSMH site or lot and observe any power line setback. 
                  (39)  There must be at least 30 feet between the SSMH and any existing structure located on the same lot. 
                  (40)  All SSMH parks must have an area of between 2½ contiguous acres and ten acres. 
                  (41)  All SSMH parks must be at least 500 feet from one another.

                  (10)  Landscaped islands shall be provided at the ends of parking bays in order to clearly define turning patterns. Parking bays shall be a maximum of ten spaces long, and walking space shall be provided at the ends or in the middle of bays. Landscaping shall be continuously maintained. 
                  (c)  Off-street loading . At the time a structure is erected or enlarged, or the use of a structure or parcel of land is changed, off-street loading spaces shall be provided as below: 
                  (1)  Merchandise, materials or supplies . Buildings or structures to be built or substantially altered which receive and distribute material or merchandise by truck shall provide and maintain off-street loading berths in sufficient number and size to adequately handle the needs of the particular use. If loading space has been provided in connection with an existing use, the loading space shall not be eliminated if elimination would result in less space than is required to adequately handle the needs of the particular use. Off-street parking areas used to fulfill the requirements of this article shall be used for loading and unloading operations except during periods of the day when not required to take care of parking needs. 
                  (2)  Passengers. A driveway designed for continuous forward flow of passenger vehicles for the purpose of loading and unloading passengers, shall be located on the site of any school or other meeting place which is designed to accommodate more than 25 persons at one time. 
                  (d)  Parking procedures and requirements . The administrative officer shall review all proposed uses requiring parking other than a single-family or duplex dwelling. In evaluating the proposal, the administrative officer shall use the parking requirements as guidelines and may require fewer total spaces where one or more of the following situations apply: 
                  (1)  Two or more uses share the same parking in such a way that the hours or days or peak usage are so different that a lower total number will provide for all uses adequately. 
                  (2)  The clientele of the use is such that a reduced number of spaces is appropriate, such as a neighborhood grocery, a business likely to be frequented by pedestrians, and so forth. 
                  (3)  Employees are residents of the structure housing the use, such as in a home occupation. 
                  (e)  Parking agreements . The applicant and the administrative officer may agree to a reduced number of parking spaces below the number required, with the agreement and condition that if more spaces are required in the future because of miscalculation, unanticipated growth, or other error, those spaces and associated maneuvering area shall be provided by the applicant. The planning commission may require that additional open space be kept in reserve for this purpose. An agreement shall be drafted to this effect. 
                  (f)  Additional parking requirements . If it appears to the administrative officer that additional parking space may be necessary beyond the existing requirements, the administrative officer may require additional open area be kept in reserve for this purpose. 
                  (g)  Street design . The street design requirements for the city are set forth in the diagram attached hereto and incorporated into and made a part of this article by reference thereto.

                  Sec. 30-138. - Setback requirements. 
                  (a)  Purpose . The purpose of this section is to establish requirements for setbacks to provide for distance from adjacent structures, protection of views and solar exposure, clear vision, and setbacks with and without approval of the administrative officer. 
                  (b)  Distance from adjacent structures . No development of any sort shall be less than ten feet from an adjacent dwelling unit, except where development is proposed between two existing structures, and there would be practical difficulty in adhering to this requirement as determined by the administrative officer. 
                  (c)  Protection of views and solar exposure . Where a proposed structure will eliminate more than 50 percent of an adjacent structure's views or exposure to the sun as estimated by the administrative officer and as measured from the main living area of the adjacent structure, an off-setting setback may be required by the administrative officer. 
                  (d)  Clear vision . A clear vision area shall be maintained on the corners of all property at the intersection of two streets, or a street and a railroad. A clear vision area shall contain no planting, fence, wall, structure or temporary or permanent obstruction exceeding 36 inches in height, except for trees with branches and foliage removed to a height of eight feet above the ground, and open wire fencing that does not obscure sight more than ten percent. 
                  (e)  With approval of the administrative officer . Zero setbacks may be allowed where it is determined that the structure will not negatively impact adjacent property, existing or future views, road expansion or availability of sunlight on adjacent property, fire regulations under the Southern Standard Building Codes are adhered to, and there is a design reason for the request, such as the obtaining of views or solar exposure, or maintenance of trees. The clear vision area, subsection (d) of this section, shall be adhered to in all cases. Applications should be filed with the city clerk and shall be considered consistent with this article if the administrative officer fails to make approval within 14 days of the date of the application. 
                  (f)  Without approval of the administrative officer . Setbacks for lot lines shall be as follows: 
                  MINIMUM SETBACKS FROM PROPERTY LINES  (IN FEET) 

                   
                  An illustrated example of setbacks is in appendix (a) to this chapter.

                  Sec. 30-139. - Height requirements. 
                  (a)  Purpose . The purpose of this section is to establish maximum height requirements for structures. 
                  (b)  Maximum height. 
                  (1)  A structure shall not exceed three stories, not including basement in height measured. 
                  (2)  The administrative officer may allow a structure to a greater height as a conditional use if: 
                  a.  Views of adjacent property are not blocked. 
                  b.  The structure would not block views from a public street or highway. 
                  c.  There is a design purpose for the greater height, such as solar exposure, maintenance of trees, or a view potential.

                  Sec. 30-140. - Buffering and screening. 
                  (a)  Purpose . This chapter allows uses normally considered to be incompatible to exist within the same district. To reduce the impacts of adjacent uses on each other, the administrative officer shall require buffers and/or screens in certain circumstances. Generally, more intensive uses require greater amounts of buffering and screening than less intensive uses. This section establishes authority, definitions, appropriateness of buffering and screening, requirements for buffering and screening in subdivisions and other planned developments, and examples of the need for buffer and screens. 
                  (b)  Authority . The administrative officer may require buffering and screening of proposed residential, commercial, industrial, or other nonresidential uses other than agricultural where they adjoin existing residential uses, undeveloped lands, parks or recreation areas, streams, or other uses which, may be incompatible with existing uses. The administrative officer shall consider proposed uses, the purpose and effectiveness of a buffer or screen, and its maintenance. Buffers and screens may constitute part of the required open space, open area or setbacks of a proposed use. Decisions of the administrative officer under this section may be appealed by an aggrieved person pursuant to the appeal procedures otherwise set forth in this chapter. 
                  (c)  Definitions . The following words, terms, and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning. 
                  Buffer . A horizontal distance, measured perpendicularly between adjacent property lines intended to provide attractive space to reduce the impacts of proposed use on adjacent property or natural features. Buffers are required to maintain existing trees or natural vegetation, block or reduce noise, glare or other emissions, or maintain privacy. 
                  Screen . A vertical barrier located in a limited space intended to perform a buffering effect, particularly for noise reduction or visual separation. 
                  (d)  Where required . Buffers and screens shall be required where the administrative officer finds that the proposed use would be incompatible with existing uses (e.g., residential adjacent to a commercial or industrial use). Buffers and screens may be required jointly or separately. Buffers may be required where the proposed site is large enough, or where the buffer can be part of required open space. Buffers are preferred where there are existing trees or other natural features such as streams, and the space can be useful for residents or the public. Screens may consist of existing or planted vegetation, attractive sight-obscuring fencing, hedges or walls, earth berms, or similar techniques. Planted screens should be sufficient to obscure the proposed use within two years. Walls or earth berms should be required where noise reduction is necessary. 
                  (e)  Appropriateness of buffers and screens . The administrative officer shall require buffers and screens only in locations and dimensions necessary to perform a stated function. The width of buffers may be adjusted to take into account natural features, traffic volumes, proposed setbacks or design, flow or natural values of streams, or other factors. The general criterion is the more intensive the proposed use and its potential for adverse impact, the greater the buffer or screen requirements. 
                  (f)  Buffering and screening of subdivisions and other planned developments . Buffering and screening requirements for all subdivisions and other planned developments shall be in accordance with the requirements of this section. 
                  (g)  Examples of the need for buffers and screens . 
                  (1)  The examples listed below represent typical cases in which buffers or screens may be required: 
                  a.  When separating incompatible land uses such as residential from commercial, industrial, or other nonresidential land uses. 
                  b.  When separating land use activities from roads or highways. 
                  c.  When keeping with conditional use requirements of various land use activities as shown in article IV of this chapter. 
                  d.  When keeping with the requirements for environmental standards as shown in section 30-143. 
                  e.  When keeping with the requirements for access as shown in section 30-145. 
                  (2)  The owner and/or developer should become familiar with the buffering and screening requirements for each appropriate land use activity and performance district in which he plans to purchase and/or develop.

                  (a)  Uses with high traffic generation, as determined by the planning commission using acceptable traffic generation documents, shall be located in the high-intensity areas of the city, or within 100 feet of the intersection of two arterial streets. 
                  (b)  Uses which would generate moderately greater traffic volumes than residential uses occupying the same land area at allowable densities shall be located on arterial streets. 
                  (c)  Uses which would generate no more traffic than a residential use occupying the same land area at allowable density levels may be located on residential or collector streets.

                  --- (1) --- 
                  Editor's note— Ord. of 10-3-2017 repealed former Art. VI, §§ 30-178—30-199, in its entirety and enacted new provisions as herein set out. Former Art. VI pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. of 12-20-2005, §§ 1000-1—1000-22. 

                  Sec. 30-178. - Purpose. 
                  (a)  The mayor and council find that signs provide an important medium through which individuals may convey a variety of messages. However, signs can pose a threat to public safety as a traffic hazard and can be a detriment to property values and the city's overall public welfare as an aesthetic nuisance. Accordingly, the mayor and council establish these regulations governing the display of signs to accomplish the following objectives: 
                  (1)  Promote and protect the public health, safety and general welfare; 
                  (2)  Enhance the economy and the business and industry of the city by promoting the reasonable, orderly and effective display of signs; 
                  (3)  Restrict signs and lights that increase clutter or that increase the probability of traffic accidents by obstructing vision; 
                  (4)  Promote signs compatible with surroundings; and 
                  (5)  Insure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign regulations. 
                  (b)  Various and diverse businesses are located within the City of Demorest. The need to advertise products and services must be balanced by the city's obligation to restrict clutter, maintain an aesthetically pleasing environment, protect property values, and enhance public safety. 
                  (c)  Regulation of the location, size, placement, and certain features of signs enables the public to locate goods, services, and facilities in the city without difficulty and confusion, improves the general attractiveness of the community, takes advantage of the beauty of the community's natural environment, and protects property values. Regulation is also necessary to facilitate and aid in the identification and location of businesses in the city in the event of police, fire, or other emergencies and to avoid confusion and delay in response to emergencies. 
                  (d)  Also, a purpose of this article is to insure proper maintenance for safety, structural soundness, and appearance of signs.

                  Sec. 30-294. - Trench excavation. 
                  (a)  Trench excavation or excavation for pipelines shall consist of excavation necessary for the construction of water lines and all appurtenant facilities therefor, including sand or crushed stone cushion, and pipe protection as called for on the plans or as specified herein. It shall include site preparation, backfilling and tamping of pipe trenches and the disposal of waste materials, all of which shall conform to the applicable provisions of these specifications. 
                  (b)  Excavation for pipe trenches shall have straight sides and shall be to such depth as will provide a minimum depth of cover of 30 inches over the pipe, except as noted on the plans. Piping installed on state highway rights-of-way side slopes, shoulders, or in ditches shall have a minimum cover of 30 inches over the pipe. Piping installed in the back slopes shall have a minimum of 30 inches of cover over the pipe. Wherever possible, piping shall be located five feet from edge of pavement. All work in state rights-of-way shall be in accord with installation permits. 
                  (c)  Trench excavation shall be made by the open cut method unless boring or jacking is shown or specified. The sides of the trench shall be cut in vertical, parallel planes and the minimum overall width of the trench shall be equal to the pipe diameter plus 12 inches. When sheeting is used, the distance between the vertical faces of the sheeting shall be equal to the overall trench width as specified above. Where vertical banks for trench excavation are not practical to construct or create dangerous working conditions, the banks may be sloped, provided that such excavation does not damage existing structures or roadways. When trench banks are sloped, the portion of the trench below the level of 12 inches above the top of the pipe shall be cut with vertical sides and to the width specified above. The bottom of the trench shall be level in cross section and shall be cut true to the required depth of the pipe except where cushion materials are specified or authorized by the engineer, in which case the excavation shall extend to the bottom of the cushion. 
                  (d)  Holes for bell-and-spigot pipe shall be excavated at proper intervals so that the barrel of the pipe will rest for its entire length upon the bottom of the trench. Bell holes shall be large enough to permit proper installation of joints in the pipe. 
                  (e)  When muck, quicksand, soft clay, swampy soil or other materials unsuitable for foundations or subgrade are encountered extending beyond the limits of the excavation, such material shall be removed and replaced with sand cushion as specified herein. 
                  (f)  Pipe trenching shall be performed so as to cause the least possible inconvenience to the public. Temporary bridges or crosswalks shall be constructed where necessary to maintain vehicular or pedestrian traffic. Crosswalks and bridges shall have handrails or other features necessary for safe use by the public. 
                  (g)  In all cases where materials are deposited along open trenches, they shall be placed and pipe ends capped so that, in the event of rain, no damage will result to the work or adjacent property. 
                  (h)  Rock will not be classified as such for additional payment. The bidder shall satisfy himself as to rock and other materials which may be encountered in excavation and make proper allowances for all contingencies in his price bid per linear foot of pipe.

                  Sec. 30-295. - Sheeting, shoring and bracing. 
                  (a)  When necessary to protect structures, paving or facilities, the sides of all excavations shall be sufficiently sheeted, shored and braced whenever necessary to prevent slides, cave-ins, settlement or movement of the banks and to maintain the excavation clear of obstructions that will, in any way, hinder or delay the progress of the work or endanger workers. Wood or steel sheet piling of ample design and type shall be used when necessary. All sheeting, shoring and bracing shall have sufficient strength and rigidity to withstand the pressures exerted and to maintain the walls of the excavation properly in place and protect all persons and property from injury or damage. 
                  (b)  Where excavations are made adjacent to existing buildings or other structures or in paved streets or alleys, the contractor shall take particular care to sheet, shore and brace the sides of the excavation adequately so as to prevent any undermining of or settlement beneath such structures or pavement. The contractor will be liable for any damage to any structure or any injury to any person that results from his operations. 
                  (c)  Sheeting and shoring materials shall be withdrawn as trenches are being backfilled, after backfill has been placed over pipe at least 18 inches. If their removal before backfill is complete endangers any adjacent structure, they shall be left in place until backfill is complete and pulled then, if possible. Voids caused by sheeting withdrawals shall be backfilled and tamped with thin rammers designed for the purpose. If not withdrawn, sheeting shall be cut off at least 18 inches below surface. 
                  (d)  Sheeting, shoring and bracing shall be considered as an integral part of the excavation work and no specific payment will be allowed therefor.

                  Sec. 30-296. - Underwater excavation. 
                  (a)  Where the excavation area shown on the plans falls under the groundwater surface or near the banks of a flowing stream or other body of water, the contractor may adopt and carry out any method he may deem feasible for the performance of the excavation work and for the protection of the work thereafter, provided the method and equipment to be used result in completed work which complies with the specifications and is acceptable to the engineer. In such cases, the excavation area shall be effectively protected from damage during the excavation period and until all contemplated construction work therein has been completed. Underwater excavation shall be in accord with the current United States Corps of Engineers National Permit for water line crossing of waterways. 
                  (b)  The cost of all temporary construction work necessary or incidental to work under water or in wet conditions, including the cost of installing and removing sand bags, coffer dams, sheet piling, excavation and backfill, pumping and dewatering, shall be considered as an integral part of the cost of excavation, and no separate payment therefor shall be allowed or made.

                  Sec. 30-297. - Structural excavation. 
                  (a)  Excavation for structures shall be sufficiently large for the proper placing of forms and concrete and for dewatering purposes but shall not be excessively large in horizontal area. Banks may be sloped at a safe angle provided that such excavation does not endanger or damage existing or proposed structures, pipelines, etc. The bottom of the excavation shall be true to the required shape and elevations shown on the plans. No earth backfilling will be permitted under structures unless specifically shown on the plans. Should the contractor excavate below the elevations shown or specified, he shall fill the void thus made with thoroughly compacted, dense graded, crushed stone, with aggregate (sand cushion) acceptable to the engineer, or with class C concrete at no additional cost to the owner. 
                  (b)  When muck, quicksand, soft clay, or other materials unsuitable for foundations are encountered extending beyond the limits of the excavation, such materials shall be removed and replaced with thoroughly compacted, dense graded, crushed stone, with aggregate (sand cushion) acceptable to the engineer, or with class C concrete. 
                  (c)  In all cases where materials are deposited along open excavation, they shall be placed so that, in the event of rain, no damage will result to the work or adjacent property.

                  Sec. 30-298. - Backfilling trenches. 
                  (a)  The backfilling of pipeline trenches shall be started immediately after the pipe work has been inspected and approved by the engineer. Backfill material shall consist of fine loose earth free of large clods, stones, vegetable matter, debris, and/or other objectionable material. Backfill shall be carefully deposited in six-inch layers (before compaction) on each side of the pipe and then thoroughly and carefully tamped or rammed around the pipe with approved power tools until enough material has been placed and compacted to provide a cover of not less than one foot over the top of the pipe. If the trench extends along or across streets, roadways, proposed roadways, usable alleys or sidewalks, the remainder of the trench shall be backfilled and tamped to its full depth in the manner specified above with a minimum density of 95 percent standard proctor for the full depth. Otherwise, it may be filled with loose material without compaction. Where tamping of material is not required for the full depth of the trench, this material (from a height of one foot above the pipe upward) shall be as hereinbefore specified, except that a broken stone content of not more than 50 percent by volume will be allowed of stones not exceeding six-inch maximum dimensions, provided that these stones are thoroughly mixed with earth. 
                  (b)  Before being placed under pavement, earth material for backfill which is, in the opinion of the engineer, too dry to allow thorough compaction, shall receive an admix of sufficient water prior to compaction to insure such compaction. Earth material considered by the engineer to have excessive water content shall not be placed. 
                  (c)  Backfill material having less than a ten percent clay content may be compacted by puddling with water in lieu of tamping when authorized by the engineer. Such puddling shall consist of applying water under pressure to the entire content of the trench beginning near the trench bottom and working through pipes or well points. 
                  (d)  Backfill materials used shall contain a sufficient amount of moisture for proper compaction. In areas to be paved and areas not to be paved but inside road rights-of-way, the backfill shall be brought up in accordance with section 30-300(a) and compacted to not less than 95 percent of standard proctor. 
                  (e)  Compaction tests will be required at varying depths and intervals determined by the engineer. Tests shall be made by a qualified independent testing laboratory selected by the engineer. The owner shall pay for all compaction testing. However, in the event that such tests fail to meet the requirements of the specifications, the expense of such tests shall be borne by the contractor. 
                  (f)  Where the test results indicate that compaction is less than the allowable minimum specified in section 30-300(a), the material will be removed to the depths and limits determined by the engineer and new material placed and compacted to minimum standards at no additional cost to the owner. 
                  (g)  Where excavation has been made within the limits of easements across private property, the top one foot of backfill material shall consist of fine loose earth free of large clods, vegetable matter, debris, stone and/or other objectionable materials. 
                  (h)  Where tamping of backfill material is not required for the full depth, the backfill material shall be neatly rounded over the trench to a sufficient height to allow for settlement to grade after consolidation. Any deficiency in the quantity of materials for backfilling the trenches or for filling the depressions caused by settlement shall be supplied by the contractor. 
                  (i)  Where pipe trenches are cut across pavement, the contractor shall construct a temporary surface over the cut by filling and tamping the upper six inches of the cut with selected gravel or crushed stone which will not disintegrate under the traffic and which shall be maintained in good condition under traffic until the permanent pavement has been constructed. No specific payment will be allowed for temporary surfacing. 
                  (j)  All backfilling shall be done in a manner which will not disturb or injure the pipe or structure over or against which it is being placed. Any pipe or structure injured, damaged or moved from its proper alignment during backfilling operations shall be opened up and then rebackfilled as herein specified. 
                  (k)  The contractor shall replace all surface materials and shall restore drives, curbing, sidewalks, gutters, shrubbery, fences, sod, and other disturbed surfaces to a condition equal to that before the work began, furnishing all labor and materials incidental thereto.

                  (1)  That the applicant's proposed wireless telecommunications facilities shall be maintained in a safe manner, and in compliance with all conditions of the special use permit, without exception, unless specifically granted relief by the city in writing, as well as all applicable and permissible local codes, ordinances, and regulations, including any and all applicable city, county, state and federal laws, rules, and regulations; and 
                  (2)  That the construction of the wireless telecommunications facilities is legally permissible, including, but not limited to the fact that the applicant is authorized to do business in the state. 
                  (l)  Where a certification is called for in this section, such certification shall bear the signature and seal of a professional engineer licensed in the state. 
                  (m)  In addition to all other required information as stated in this section, all applications for the construction or installation of new wireless telecommunications facilities or modification of an existing facility shall contain the information hereinafter set forth. Note that an applicant will be granted permission for anything that it can conclusively prove the technical need for, but that there is often a significant difference between "need" and "want" or "desire." For example, an assertion that the "need" is based on an applicant's own design criteria shall not suffice to prove the technological need for what is requested. For purposes of permitting under this section, "need" shall mean what is technologically needed for the equipment to function as designed by the manufacturer and that anything less will result in prohibiting or acting in a manner that prohibits the provision of service as intended and described in the narrative of the application.

                  (a)  Design requirements of new towers. The tower shall be structurally designed to accommodate at least five additional antenna arrays equivalent to those of the applicant regarding the load and stress created on the tower, and located as close to the applicant's antenna as possible without causing interference. A claim of interference because of a need to have greater than six feet of vertical clearance between facilities, measured from the vertical centerline of one array to the vertical centerline of another, must be proven by technical data and not merely verbal or written assertions. This requirement may be waived, provided that the applicant, in writing, demonstrates that the provisions of future shared usage of the tower is not technologically feasible, is commercially impracticable or creates an unnecessary and unreasonable burden, based upon: 
                  (1)  The kind of wireless telecommunications facilities site and structure proposed; 
                  (2)  Available space on existing and approved towers; and 
                  (3)  The need for more than six feet of vertical clearance between antenna arrays, measured from the vertical centerline of one array to the vertical centerline of another, such that there would not be adequate vertical space to accommodate a total of four carriers. 
                  (b)  The owner of a proposed new tower, and his/her successors in interest, shall negotiate in good faith for the shared use of the proposed tower by other wireless service providers in the future, and shall: 
                  (1)  Respond within 60 days to a request for information from a potential shared-use applicant; 
                  (2)  Negotiate in good faith concerning future requests for shared use of the new tower by other telecommunications providers; 
                  (3)  Allow shared use of the new tower if another telecommunications provider agrees in writing to pay reasonable charges. The charges may include, but are not limited to, a pro rata share of the cost of site selection, planning, project administration, land costs, site design, construction and maintenance financing, return on equity, less depreciation, and all of the costs of adapting the tower or equipment to accommodate a shared user without causing electromagnetic interference; and 
                  (4)  Failure to abide by the conditions outlined above may be grounds for revocation of the special use permit.

                  (a)  Applicants for wireless telecommunications facilities shall locate, site and erect said wireless telecommunications facilities in accordance with the following priorities, one being the highest priority and five being the lowest priority: 
                  (1)  On existing towers or other structures without increasing the height of the tower or structure. 
                  (2)  On government-owned properties or facilities. 
                  (3)  On properties in areas zoned for business use. 
                  (4)  On properties in areas zoned for agricultural use. 
                  (5)  On properties in areas zoned for residential use. 
                  (b)  If the proposed site is not proposed for the highest priority listed above, then a detailed explanation and justification must be provided as to why a site of all higher priority designations was not selected. The person seeking such an exception must satisfactorily demonstrate the reason or reasons why such a permit should be granted for the proposed site, and the hardship that would be incurred by the applicant if the permit were not granted for the wireless facility as proposed. 
                  (c)  An applicant may not by-pass sites of higher priority by stating the site proposed is the only site leased or selected or because there is an existing lease with a landowner. An application shall address colocation as an option. If such option is not proposed, the applicant must explain to the reasonable satisfaction of the city why colocation is commercially impracticable or otherwise impracticable. Agreements between providers limiting or prohibiting colocation shall not be a valid basis for any claim of commercial impracticability or hardship. 
                  (d)  Notwithstanding the above, the city may approve any site located within an area in the above list of priorities, provided that the city finds that the proposed site is in the best interest of the health, safety and welfare of the city and its inhabitants and will not have a deleterious effect on the nature and character of the community and neighborhood. Conversely, the city may direct that the proposed location be changed to another location that is more in keeping with the goals of this section and the public interest as determined by city. 
                  (e)  The applicant shall submit a detailed written report demonstrating the applicant's review of the above locations in order of priority, demonstrating the technological reason for the site selection. If appropriate, based on selecting a site of lower priority, a detailed written explanation as to why sites of a higher priority were not selected shall be included with the application, including the technical justification for such.

                  Sec. 30-404. - Height of telecommunications towers. 
                  (a)  All new towers shall be of the monopole type, unless such is able to be proven to be technologically impracticable. No new towers of a lattice or guyed-type shall be permitted, unless relief is otherwise expressly granted. 
                  (b)  The applicant shall submit documentation justifying the technical need by the service provider for the total height of any tower, facility and/or antenna requested and the basis therefore. To enable verification of the need for the requested height, documentation in the form of propagation studies must include all backup data used to produce the studies at the height requested and at a minimum of ten feet lower height. Such documentation will be analyzed in the context of the justification of the height needed to provide service primarily and essentially within the city, to the extent practicable, unless good cause is shown. 
                  (c)  The maximum permitted total height of a new tower shall be 100 feet above preconstruction ground level, unless it can be proven that such height would prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of service in the intended service area. The 100-foot maximum permitted height is not as-of-right height, but rather the maximum permitted height, absent proof of the technological need for a greater height. 
                  (d)  Notwithstanding the 100-foot maximum permitted height, telecommunications towers and facilities shall be no taller than the minimum height technologically necessary to enable the provision of wireless service coverage or capacity as needed within the city. 
                  (e)  Spacing or the distance between towers shall be such that the service may be provided without exceeding the maximum permitted height.

The present value of the structure and the costs of repair, alteration, or improvement may be established by affidavits of real estate appraisers with a Georgia appraiser classification as provided in Chapter 39A of Title 43 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, qualified building contractors, or qualified building inspectors without actual testimony presented. Costs of repair, alteration, or improvement of the structure shall be the cost necessary to bring the structure into compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violations in force in the jurisdiction.

Such abatement action shall commence within 270 days after the expiration of time specified in the order for abatement by the owner. Any time during which such action is prohibited by a court order issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 41-2-13 or any other equitable relief granted by a court of competent jurisdiction shall not be counted toward the 270 days in which such abatement action must commence. The city manager shall cause to be posed on the main entrance of the building, dwelling, or structure a placard with the following words: This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business use and does not comply with the applicable codes or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with drug crimes or constitutes an endangerment to public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful. 
                  It shall be unlawful for such placard to be mutilated or removed or for such building to be occupied until the required corrective action is taken.

                  If the city manager has the structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any moneys received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. The city manager and governing authority are relieved of any and all liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials

                  (2)  The lien provided for in this section shall attach to the real property upon the filing of a certified copy of the order requiring repair, closure, or demolition in the office of the clerk of Habersham County Superior Court and shall relate back to the date of the filing of the lis pendens notice required under subsection (c) of Code Section 41-2-12. The clerk of superior court shall record and index such certified copy of the order in the deed records of the county and enter the lien on the general execution docket. The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except liens for taxes to which the lien shall be inferior, and shall continue in force until paid.

The statement of the city manager shall be transmitted within 90 days of completion of the repairs, demolition, or closure. 
                  (4)  It shall be the duty of the appropriate county tax commissioner or municipal tax collector or city revenue officer, who is responsible or whose duties include the collection of municipal taxes, to collect the amount of the lien using all methods available for collecting real property ad valorem taxes, including specifically Chapter 4 of Title 48; provided, however, that the limitation of Code Section 48-4-78 which requires 12 months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure shall not apply. A county tax commissioner shall collect and enforce municipal liens imposed pursuant to this chapter in accordance with Code Section 48-5-359.1. The county tax commissioner or municipal tax collector or city revenue officer shall remit the amount collected to the governing authority of the City of Demorest. 
                  (5)  Enforcement of liens pursuant to this section may be initiated at any time following receipt by the county tax commissioner or municipal tax collector or city revenue officer of the final determination of costs in accordance with this chapter. The unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties from and after the date of final determination of costs in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes. An enforcement proceeding pursuant to Code Section 48-4-78 for delinquent ad valorem taxes may include all amounts due under this chapter. 
                  (6)  The redemption amount in any enforcement proceeding pursuant to this section shall be the full amount of the costs as finally determined in accordance with this section together with interest, penalties, and costs incurred by the City of Demorest, county tax commissioner, municipal tax collector, or city revenue officer in the enforcement of such lien. Redemption of property from the lien may be made in accordance with the provisions of Code Sections 48-4-80 and 48-4-81. 
                  (7)  The city may waive and release any such lien imposed on property upon the owner of such property entering into a contract with the city agreeing to a timetable for rehabilitation of the real property or the dwelling, building, or structure on the property and demonstrating the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation. 
                  (8)  Where the abatement action does not commence in the superior court, review of a court order requiring the repair, alteration, improvement, or demolition of a dwelling, building, or structure shall be by direct appeal to the superior court under Code Section 5-3-29.

                  Any person affected by an order issued by the city manager may petition to the superior court for an injunction restraining the city manager from carrying out the provisions of the order and the court may, upon such petition, issue a temporary injunction restraining the city manager pending the final disposition of the cause; provided, however, that such person shall present such petition to the court within 15 days of the posting and service of the order of the city manager. De novo hearings shall be had by the court on petitions within 20 days. The court shall hear and determine the issues raised and shall enter such final order or decree as law and justice may require; provided, however, that it shall not be necessary to file bond in any amount before obtaining a temporary injunction under this section.

The city's meter may be installed at or near the property line or upon the property to be served within three feet of the property line at the city's discretion in accord with reasonable engineering practices. The city may refuse service if the lines upon the property to be served or the piping located thereon are installed or exist in such manner as to prevent cross connections or back flow.

Water provided by the city shall not be used for irrigation, fire protection, or other purposes, except if water is available in sufficient quantity without interfering with regular domestic consumption in the area served. If a meter or meter box is placed on the premises of a user, then a suitable location shall be provided by the user that is unobstructed and accessible at all times to the meter reader. The user shall furnish and maintain a private cut off value on the user's side of the meter. The user's piping and apparatus shall be installed and maintained by the user at the user's expense in a safe and efficient manner and in accord with regulations promulgated by the State of Georgia and any other applicable regulation. All applicants and users must offer proof that any private well located upon the property is not physically connected to the lines of the city's water system.

Bills shall be paid at City Hall in Demorest or at such other location designated by the city. A failure to receive bills or notices shall not prevent bills from becoming delinquent or relieve the user from payment. The failure of water and/or sewer users to pay charges duly imposed shall result in the automatic imposition of the following fees: 
                  (1)  Nonpayment on the due date will be subject to a fee of ten percent of the delinquent account; 
                  (2)  Nonpayment after two billing cycles shall result in water being disconnected from the user's property. Payment is not authorized in the field. If a disconnect work order is issued, then the disconnection crew lacks the authority to accept payment in the field; 
                  (3)  The city may require an additional deposit to insure proper payment of water and sewer charges; 
                  (4)  Vacant or unoccupied property may continue to receive water and sewer service. However, minimum bills and charges for water used shall continue to be due. If service is terminated, then any vacant or unoccupied property shall be treated as a new user and must apply for service and pay applicable fees; 
                  (5)  A $35.00 fee shall be charged for all returned checks, which may also result in the disconnection of service; and 
                  (f)  A service that has been disconnected for nonpayment shall be restored only after the outstanding invoice has been paid in full, a security deposit approved by the mayor and city council has been paid, and a reconnection fee of $40.00 paid by cash, credit card or certified funds. All disconnected accounts paid after 2:00 p.m. shall be reconnected the next business day.

                  Sec. 74-8. - Billing for multi-unit buildings. 
                  (a)  All existing multi-unit buildings (including but not limited to apartments, townhomes, condominiums, and commercial buildings containing multiple tenant spaces) with a utility-owned master meter shall be billed a monthly base rate that is equivalent to the established monthly base rate for a single unit times the number of units within the building as indicated by planning and zoning approved plans, whether occupied or not, plus any excess water used above the calculated minimum charge. Any new multi-unit buildings (including but not limited to apartments, townhomes, condominiums, and commercial buildings containing multiple tenant spaces) shall have individual water utility owned meters on each unit or sub-unit meters owned and managed by the property owner with a utility owned master meter that bills for water service based on volume of use for each customer. If existing city-owned rights-of-way are not suitable for the installation of individual meters, the following conditions must be met for the installation of individual meters on private property: 
                  (1)  The owners of all individual living units shall grant easements to the city for meter installation within ten feet of the curb line of existing rights-of-way for water mains. 
                  (2)  The easements shall comply with water department specifications. 
                  (3)  The owner of all individual living units shall indemnify the city against all damage claims resulting from the installation, maintenance of and access to meters on private property. 
                  (4)  The owner of each individual living premises shall acknowledge in writing that water lines between the meter and living unit and the living unit interior plumbing will be maintained by the owner and that cutoff valves must be installed by the owner on the discharge side of the meter box at or near the property line. 
                  (5)  If required in lieu of dedicated streets, a 20-foot right-of-way centered on the water main shall be conveyed to the city, except that the director of the water and sewer department may accept a narrower right-of-way if obstructions require less than 20 feet. 
                  (b)  If an owner of multi-family dwelling or complex fails to install a separate water meter for each individual dwelling unit, the water service to such customer at that address shall be discontinued until the property owner complies with the requirements of this section.

                  Sec. 74-9. - Suspension of service. 
                  (a)  If water and/or sewer service is discontinued and all outstanding invoices are paid, then the security deposit shall be refunded to the user by the city. If the service is discontinued for nonpayment of invoices, then the security deposit shall be applied by the city toward the account balance. Any balance of the security deposit shall be refunded to the user according to the policy set in the user agreement. However, if the security deposit is insufficient to pay the outstanding invoice then the city may proceed to collect the balance from the user. Services disconnected for nonpayment of bills shall be restored only after the outstanding invoice is paid in full. Any user who enters the meter box and turns on the service shall be in violation of this article and subject to applicable penalties. 
                  (b)  The city reserves the option to discontinue service without notice for the following reasons: 
                  (1)  To prevent fraud or abuse; 
                  (2)  Past due accounts; 
                  (3)  Willful disregard of the city's rules and regulations; 
                  (4)  Emergency repairs; 
                  (5)  Insufficient water supply due to circumstances beyond the city's control; 
                  (6)  Legal processes; 
                  (7)  Direction of public authorities; or

A user may pay a bill under protest, and such payment shall not prejudice the claim. The city shall make a special meter reading at the request of a user for a fee of $5.00. If the special reading discloses that the meter was misread, then no charge shall be due, and any payment shall be refunded to the user. A water meter shall be tested for the production of a data log at the user's request upon payment to the city in the amount of $30.00. If the meter is found to over-register beyond three percent of the correct volume, then no charge shall be due from the user, and any charge shall be refunded to the user. If the seal of a meter is broken by someone other than the city's authorized agent or employee or if the meter fails to register correctly or if stopped by any cause, then the user shall pay an amount estimated based upon the record of previous bills to the location and/or other proper data. Disputed bills shall be paid in full, and a request for adjustment shall be submitted to the city clerk. An adjustment to the bill will be determined according to internal policy.

If, in his or her discretion, such employee determines that identity theft or attempted identity theft is likely or probable, such employee shall immediately report such red flags to the city manager or his or her designee. If, in his or her discretion, such employee deems that identity theft is unlikely or that reliable information is available to reconcile red flags, the employee shall convey this information to the city manager or his or her designee, who may determine in his or her discretion that no further action is necessary.

                  (4)  Notify a debt collector within 24 hours of the discovery of likely or probable identity theft relating to a customer account that has been sold to such debt collector in the event that a customer's account has been sold to a debt collector prior to the discovery of the likelihood or probability of identity theft relating to such account. This notification may be delayed if a law enforcement agency determines that the notification will compromise a criminal investigation. Notification shall be made after the law enforcement agency determines that it will not compromise the investigation; 
                  (5)  Notify law enforcement, in the event that someone other than the customer has accessed the customer's account causing additional charges to accrue or accessing personal identifying information; or 
                  (6)  Take other appropriate action to prevent or mitigate identity theft. 
                  (b)  In the event any city employee responsible for or involved in opening a new covered account becomes aware of red flags indicating possible identity theft with respect an application for a new account, such employee shall use his or her discretion to determine whether such red flag or combination of red flags suggests a threat of identity theft. If, in his or her discretion, such employee determines that identity theft or attempted identity theft is likely or probable, such employee shall immediately report such red flags to the city manager or his or her designee.

                  If the city manager or his or her designee in his or her discretion determines that further action is necessary, a city employee shall perform one or more of the following responses, as determined to be appropriate by the city manager or his or her designee: 
                  (1)  Request additional identifying information from the applicant; 
                  (2)  Deny the application for the new account; 
                  (3)  Notify law enforcement of possible identity theft; or
