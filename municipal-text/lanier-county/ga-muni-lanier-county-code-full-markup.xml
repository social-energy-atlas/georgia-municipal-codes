         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE                   This Code constitutes a codification of the general and permanent ordinances of Lanier County, Georgia. 
                  Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the general and permanent ordinances of the county as adopted by the board of county commissioners through July 8, 2013. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section or ordinance included in the Code. 
                  The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
                  Chapter and Section Numbering System 
                  The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and, at the same time, new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
                  Page Numbering System 
                  The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

                   
                  Indexes 
                  The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
                  Looseleaf Supplements 
                  A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
                  Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
                  Acknowledgments 
                  This publication was under the direct supervision of Jim Jenkins, Senior Code Attorney, and Nicole C. Fluitt, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
                  The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Donna Studstill, County Clerk, for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the county readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the county's affairs.

Each act of violation and each day upon which any such violation shall continue or occur shall constitute a separate offense. The penalty provided by this section, unless another penalty is expressly provided, shall apply to the amendment of any Code section, whether or not such penalty is reenacted in the amendatory ordinance.

                  (a)	The flood hazard areas of the county are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (b)	These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
                  (Ord. of 12-13-2010, art. 1, § B)
                  Sec. 16-3. - Statement of purpose. 
                  It is the purpose of this chapter to promote public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)	Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which, serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)	Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities or erosion; 
                  (3)	Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
                  (4)	Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and 
                  (5)	Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.

                  (1)	To protect human life and health;
                  (2)	To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities, such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
                  (3)	To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; 
                  (4)	To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
                  (5)	To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
                  (6)	To minimize prolonged business interruptions; and
                  (7)	To ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

                  Existing construction means, for the purposes of determining rates, structures for which the start of construction commenced before December 17, 2010. 
                  Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed, including at a minimum the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads is completed before May 12, 1997. 
                  Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed, including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads. 
                  Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
                  (1)	The overflow of inland or tidal waters; or

                  Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
                  Freeboard means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of floodplain management. The term "freeboard" tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed. 
                  Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, adjacent to the proposed foundation of a building. 
                  Historic structure means any structure that is: 
                  (1)	Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register; 
                  (2)	Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district; 
                  (3)	Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places and determined as eligible by states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the Secretary of the Interior; or 
                  (4)	Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places and determined as eligible by communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either: 
                  a.	By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior; or
                  b.	Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs.
                  Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including a basement. An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage, in an area other than a basement, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of other provisions of this Code. 
                  Manufactured home means a building, transportable in one or more sections, built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and similar transportable structures placed on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer and intended to be improved property. 
                  Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
                  Mean sea level means the average height of the sea for all stages of the tide. It is used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain. For the purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map are referenced. 
                  National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD), as corrected in 1929, is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
                  New construction means, for the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the start of construction commenced after December 17, 2010, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, the term "new construction" means structures for which the start of construction commenced after May 12, 1997, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
                  New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed, including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads is completed after May 12, 1997. 
                  North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) has replaced the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 in existing and future FEMA flood modernization maps. 
                  Recreational vehicle means a vehicle which is: 
                  (1)	Built on a single chassis;
                  (2)	400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection;
                  (3)	Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and
                  (4)	Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
                  Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. Note: Accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance requirements. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
                  Subdivision means the division of a single lot into two or more lots for the purpose of sale or development. 
                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
                  Substantial improvement. 
                  (1)	The term "substantial improvement" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the start of construction of the improvement. Note: The market value of the structure should be: 
                  a.	The appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement; or 
                  b.	In the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring.
                  This term "substantial improvement" includes structures, which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
                  (2)	For the purposes of this definition, the term "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term "substantial improvement" does not, however, include: 
                  a.	Those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to ensure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project; or 
                  b.	Any alteration of a historic structure provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. 
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  ARTICLE III. - PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

                  Sec. 16-68. - General standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)	New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure; 
                  (2)	New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage; 
                  (3)	New construction or substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
                  (4)	Elevated buildings. All new construction or substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater. 
                  a.	Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
                  1.	Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
                  2.	The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and
                  3.	Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both direction; 
                  b.	So as not to violate the lowest floor criteria of this chapter, the unfinished or flood resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area; and 
                  c.	The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms; 
                  (5)	All heating and air conditioning equipment and components, including ductwork, all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding; 
                  (6)	Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces; 
                  (7)	New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system; 
                  (8)	New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters; 
                  (9)	On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding; and 
                  (10)	Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure, which is not compliant with the provisions of this chapter, shall be undertaken only if the nonconformity is not furthered, extended or replaced. 
                  (Ord. of 12-13-2010, art. 4, § A)
                  Sec. 16-69. - Specific standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)	New construction and/or substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and/or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 16-68(4), elevated buildings. All heating and air conditioning equipment and components, including ductwork, all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  (2)	Nonresidential construction. New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH zones may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in section 16-46(c). 
                  (3)	Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data is available: 
                  a.	All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on:
                  1.	Individual lots or parcels;
                  2.	In new and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions;
                  3.	In expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions; or
                  4.	On a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  b.	Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
                  1.	The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or 
                  2.	The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
                  c.	All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (See section 16-68(6).) 
                  d.	All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either:
                  1.	Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days;
                  2.	Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions); or 
                  3.	The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for new Construction, including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsection (3)c of this section. 
                  (4)	Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 16-7, are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  a.	Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof.

                  (d)	Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (e)	Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (f)	Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (g)	In reviewing such requests, the planning commission shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this chapter. 
                  (h)	Conditions for variances.
                  (1)	A variance shall be issued only when there is:
                  a.	A finding of good and sufficient cause;
                  b.	A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  c.	A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  (2)	The provisions of this chapter are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefor any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of a historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (3)	Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (4)	The building inspector shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (i)	Upon consideration of the factors listed in this section and the purposes of this article, the planning commission may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

                  3-9.3	Separation from Principal Use. Any accessory building of more than eight (8) feet in height shall be located at least ten (10) feet from the principal building. 
                  3-10	Every Lot Shall Abut a Street. No building shall be erected on a lot which does not abut an open public street (or an approved private street meeting current county development standards and duly approved by the County Commission). Every lot shall abut such street for a contiguous and uniform width as dictated by the respective land development district. For the purpose of establishing lot abutment and minimum width to an approved street, easements, flag lots, and inconsistent widths are not acceptable in lieu of minimum lot frontage and abutment standards. These design standards shall not apply to lots abutting the radius of a cul-de-sac, where lot width shall be measured at the building setback line. 
                  3-11	Lots With Multiple Frontage. In the case of a corner lot, side yard setback requirements from the centerline of the street right-of-way shall [be] equal to seventy-five percent (75%) of that required for the front yard setback for the respective land development district. On a corner lot where the main entrance into a residence is facing a side yard, it shall be permissible, for purposes of this ordinance, to interpret the residence to be fronting on the street other than that street which said entrance faces, and side and rear yard requirements may be provided accordingly. If a building is constructed on a through lot having frontage on two (2) or more roads not at an intersection, a setback from each road shall be provided equal to the front yard requirement for the district in which the lot is located. 
                  3-12	Visibility at Intersections. On corner lots within all land development districts, no fence, shrubbery or other obstruction to the traffic sight vision, except utility poles or light or sign standards, shall exceed a height of three (3) feet within a triangular area formed by the intersection of the right-of-way lines of two (2) streets or a street intersection with a railroad right-of-way line, and a diagonal line which intersects the right-of-way liens at two (2) points, each twenty (20) feet distance from the intersection of the right-of-way lines, or, in the case of a rounded corner, from the point of intersection of their tangents; provided, however, signs, lights, or similar objects which are totally located at least twelve (12) feet above the finished grade shall be permitted. (See illustration.) 

                  3-13	Uses Prohibited. If either a use or class of use is not specifically indicated as being permitted in a district, either as a matter of right, or as a Special Exception, then such use, class of use, or structures for such uses, shall be prohibited in such district. 
                  3-14	Land Development Regulations to Apply When Lot is Divided by District Boundary Line. In the event that a district boundary line on the land development districts map divides a lot of record held in one (1) ownership on the date of passage of this ordinance, each part of the lot so divided shall be used in conformity with the regulations established by this ordinance for the district in which such parcel is located; except, however, that if the property owner of such a lot so desires, he may extend a use allowed on either portion of said lot fifty (50) feet beyond the district boundary line in accordance with setbacks and yard requirements of the district into which he is encroaching. 
                  3-15	Height Limitations of Walls and Fences. Within any residential district, no wall or fence shall exceed eight (8) feet in height within or along a boundary of a rear or side yard. Within the front yard, all fences shall have a height limit of four (4) feet. 
                  3-16	Required Buffers in RC, GB, WLI, and HI Districts. In an RC, GB, WLI, and HI land development district, where a lot abuts any residential district, a six (6) foot wide buffer the entire length of the lot abutting the residential property shall be provided with screening as specified in Section 3-19. Off-street parking associated with such uses shall be governed by this same provision. 
                  3-17	Screening of Service Areas Within One Hundred Fifty (150) Feet of Public Street. Any service area, loading area, refuse, or storage area between a principal building and a public street being visible from said street and lying within one hundred fifty (150) feet of said street shall be screened from view from the public street as specified in Section 3-19. 
                  3-18	Screening Required. Wherever screening is required by this ordinance, a durable masonry wall, or fence and hedge of sufficient opacity to provide a visual blind, designed to be compatible with the character of adjoining properties, shall be provided and maintained by the owner and his successors and assigns. Such fences and walls shall be at least six (6) feet in height, but no greater than eight (8) feet in height, measured from the ground along the common lot line of the adjoining properties. Hedges or comparable natural plantings shall be of such variety that an average height of at least six (6) feet could be expected by normal growth within no later than three (3) years from the time of planting. The owner/developer shall install the required screening prior to the issuance of the certificate of occupancy. Occupancy will not be allowed until the screening is completed as a part of the normal developmental requirements. 
                  3-19	Side and Rear Yards Not Required Next to Railroad. Within any non-residential district, side yards and rear yards shall not be required adjacent to railroad rights-of-way. 
                  3-20	Substandard Lots of Record. Any lot of record existing at the time of the adoption of this ordinance which has an area or a width which is less than that required by this ordinance may be used as a building site for a structure or use permitted in that zone; provided, however, that the same yard, setback, open space, and other dimensional requirements are met that would be required for a standard lot, except as stipulated in Section 3-25. 
                  3-21	Permitted Modification of Setback Requirement. When a building is proposed on a lot and when on either or both lots which adjoin such lot at the street right-of-way line there exists a principal building which does not conform to the setback requirements of this ordinance, the required setback for such building shall be as follows: (1) where only one said adjoining lot contains a principal building with a non-conforming setback the setback shall be the computed average of (a) the normal setback requirement with (b) the non-conforming setback, or (2) where both adjoining lots contain a principal building each with a non-conforming setback, the minimum setback shall be the computed average of the two non-conforming setbacks. 
                  3-22	Structures Permitted Above the Height Limit. The height limits of these regulations shall not apply to a church spire, belfry, cupola, dome, or ornamental tower not intended for human occupancy, monument, water tower, observation tower, transmission tower, chimney, smoke stack, conveyor, flag pole, radio or television tower, mast or aerial, parapet wall not extending more than four (4) feet above the roof line of the building, and necessary mechanical appurtenances. (See Section 3-26.) 
                  3-23	Permitted Encroachments of Yards and Setbacks. Architectural features such as cornices, eaves, steps, gutters, and fire escapes may project not more than three (3) feet beyond any required setback line, except where such projections would obstruct driveways which are or may be used for access for service and/or emergency vehicles; provided, however, that in the case of automobile service stations, motels, and similar uses which serve the motoring public, canopies shall be allowed over a driveway or walkways within the front yard not to extend from the principal building to a point any closer than fifteen (15) feet from the street right-of-way line. 
                  3-24	Modification of Side Yard Requirements. When a lot of record has a width less than the frontage required in the district in which it is located, then the Land Development Administrator shall be authorized to reduce the side yard requirements for such lot; provided, however, that there shall not be less than an eight (8) foot side yard. 
                  3-25	Variances to Height Requirements. Chimneys, water, fire, radio and television towers, church spires, domes, cupolas, stage towers, and scenery lofts, cooling towers, elevator bulkheads, smokestacks, flag poles, parapet walls, silos, grainaries, windmills, and similar structures and their necessary mechanical appurtenances may be erected above the height limits herein established after a proper variance has been obtained from the Board of Appeals. Any such approval of a greater height shall be in accord with the flight approach zone maps on file with the Land Development Administrator of the City of Lakeland, Georgia. All such height variances shall also be closely coordinated with the Lakeland/Lanier County Airport Authority and the Federal Aviation Administration. 
                  3-26	Prohibited Uses in All Residential Districts. 
                  1)	It shall be [a] prohibited use in all residential districts and residential lots to park or store in the open, wrecked or junked vehicles, power-driven construction equipment, used lumber, metal or rubbish, or any other miscellaneous scrap or salvageable material.

                  4-3	Interpretation of Land Development District Boundaries. When uncertainty exists with respect to the location of boundaries of any land development district as shown on the "Official Land Development Districts Map of Lanier County," the following rules shall apply: 
                  4-3.1	Unless otherwise specifically indicated, where district boundaries are indicated on the land development map as approximately following the centerline of a street right-of-way, highway, railroad right-of-way line, stream bed, or river bed; such centerlines shall be interpreted to be such district boundaries. 
                  4-3.2	Boundaries indicated as approximately following platted lot lines shall be interpreted as following such lot lines. 
                  4-3.3	Where district boundaries are indicated on the land development map as approximately following the corporate limit lines, then such corporate limit lines shall be interpreted to be such district boundaries. 
                  4-3.4	Where district boundaries are indicated on the land development map as being set back from the centerline of a street right-of-way, road, highway, railroad, stream, or river, and parallel thereto, then such district boundaries, unless otherwise specifically indicated, shall be interpreted as being at the scaled distance from the centerline of such street, road, highway, railroad, stream, or river as being parallel thereto. 
                  4-4	Planned Development District (PD). 
                  4-4.1	Purposes and Intent. Planned Development (PD) Districts are intended to provide an alternative method of land development and redevelopment not available within the framework of standard land development districts. The standards and procedures of approving these districts are intended to promote flexibility of design and allow for planned diversification and integration of uses and structures while at the same time, retaining in the Commission the absolute authority to establish such conditions, limitations and regulations as it deems necessary to maintain community aesthetics and to protect the public health, safety and general welfare. In doing so, the Planned Development Districts are designed to achieve the following objectives: 
                  a.	Accomplish a more desirable development pattern than would be possible through strict adherence of standard land development and subdivision regulations. 
                  b.	Accommodate a mixture of uses and/or development patterns which are compatible both internally and externally through limitations on sign control, building orientations, buffering or other techniques which may be appropriate to a particular development proposal. 
                  c.	Encourage flexible and creative concepts of site development planning which meet changing needs, technologies, economic and consumer preferences. 
                  d.	Permit the combining and coordinating of architectural styles, building forms and building relationships within a Planned Development. 
                  e.	Preserve natural amenities of the land by encouraging scenic and functional open areas.
                  f.	Encourage an efficient use of land, where appropriate and beneficial to the County, resulting in smaller networks of streets and utilities thereby lowering development and housing costs. 
                  g.	Maintain consistency with the Goals, Policies, and Future Land Use elements of the Comprehensive Plan. 
                  4-4.2	Relation to Land Development Districts and Other Regulations. Planned Development Districts are not the same as a land development district, but instead reflect a special development. A Planned Development approval may also be ignored and the property may still be developed at any time in accordance with the current land development district regulations. However, once development has commenced under a Planned Development approval, development must continue under the terms and conditions of the approval until it is completed or until the Planned Development approval is properly amended or deleted. 
                  a.	Planned Developments shall meet the intent of all applicable development regulations of Lanier County. These shall include, but not be limited to, the Land Development Ordinance, Land Subdivision Regulations, and Standard Construction Codes. Where these are in conflict, the approved Planned Development plans, terms and conditions shall take precedence. All proposed deviations from the County's development standards shall be itemized and depicted in the Planned Development proposal. If not, county construction standards regarding streets, parking and utilities shall be met in all Planned Development proposals without deviation or variance. 
                  b.	Planned Developments shall not be used as merely a means to avoid full compliance with standard development regulations for purposes of private gain. Development proposals that can easily be accomplished under standard development regulations and/or a different land development classification, will not be approved as a Planned Development District. 
                  4-4.3	Eligibility Requirements. [The] minimum acreage for Planned Development proposal shall be as follows: 
                  a.	All-residential developments: 10 acres.
                  b.	Non-residential or mixed use development: 20 acres.
                  4-4.4	Planned Development Review Process and Fees. Planned Developments shall be reviewed and advertised in a similar manner as a proposed Land Development Map amendment as described in Section 13 Amendment. Pre-application meeting(s) with appropriate County staff shall be required to discuss the proposal before the application is submitted. Base application fees shall be ($300) for an all-residential development and ($500) for a non-residential or mixed-use development. Additional fees for advertising shall be required in accordance with Section 13. 
                  4-4.5	Development Plan Submittal Requirements. Proposed development plans shall include, but not be limited to, the following. County staff at the pre-application meeting or during the review process may determine additional submittal requirements. 
                  a.	Completed application forms as provided by the Zoning Administrator.
                  b.	Letter of Intent. This shall be signed by the applicant and consist of a brief narrative describing the proposed project. This shall include, but not be limited to: location, specific list of proposed uses, gross/net acreages for development, building sizes, dwelling unit densities, development timeline. 
                  c.	If developed in phases, a master concept plan shall be submitted delineating the area of each phase. If deemed necessary, each phase of the development shall be reviewed and approved separately. 
                  d.	Mechanically drawn site plans. These shall be prepared by any of the following that are certified/registered in the State of Georgia: land surveyor, engineer, architect, and landscape architect. Appropriate numbers of copies shall be provided for necessary staff review and public hearings. These plans shall include, but not be limited to, the following: 
                  1.	Location map depicting subject property's relation to major roads, city boundaries, etc. 
                  2.	Title, scale, and North arrow.
                  3.	Existing and proposed site improvements which depict building locations with their approximate sizes, building setbacks, parking and other paved areas, all utility facilities and easements, and drainage structures. 
                  4.	Detention/retention areas with depicted outfalls and impervious surface calculations.
                  5.	Landscape plan showing any vegetative buffers, open spaces, and other landscaping. Plant species shall be depicted where appropriate. A minimum 15% of the gross property acreage shall be reserved as vegetated open space and/or outdoor recreation area. 
                  6.	Building front elevations where appropriate.
                  e.	Boundary survey and/or legal description in metes and bounds.
                  f.	Proposed list of deviations from the County's development standards.

This may include protective covenants, deed restrictions, maintenance agreements, etc. Conditions of approval for the development shall be made binding on all heirs, assigns, and successors to the development. 
                  h.	Written approval from the County Engineer stating that the proposal is in compliance with the County's street, parking and utilities regulations. 
                  4-4.6	Terms and Conditions of Approval. Development approval shall be tied to all approved site plans made part of the public hearing. Conditions of approval shall address, but not be limited to, the following: 
                  a.	Time limits by which to begin and/or complete the total development or each development phase where appropriate. 
                  b.	Dedications and/or maintenance of public rights-of-way, easements, and other public spaces. 
                  c.	Complete list of all land uses to be permitted under the Planned Development approval.
                  4-4.7	Planned Development Amendments or Deletions. 
                  a.	Amendment. Substantial amendments to an approved Planned Development District shall be reviewed and processed in the same manner as if it were a completely new development proposal. The term "substantial" shall include, but not be limited to, any of the following: 
                  1.	Greater than 10% increase in number of dwelling units, overall building size(s), building height, or total impervious surface area. 
                  2.	Reduction by greater than 10% of landscaped or open space areas, or building setbacks.
                  3.	Significant relocation of buildings or other site features.
                  4.	Any change in the boundaries of the Planned Development District.
                  Non-substantial amendments to an approved Planned Development District shall be reviewed and approved jointly by the Zoning Administrator, Planning Director and Director of Inspections. At their discretion, such amendments may be presented to the Planning Commission. 
                  b.	Deletion or revocation of an approved Planned Development District, or any portion thereof, shall be reviewed and considered in the same manner as a substantial amendment described above. The Planning Commission, the original applicant(s), or the County of Lanier may initiate said deletion or revocation. However, the total development or phased portion thereof has not commenced construction within its specified time period, then the Planned Development approval for all/that portion shall be automatically revoked. The applicant(s) would then need to re-apply for another Planned Development approval in order for the development to proceed. 
                  4-4.8	Enforcement and Penalties. The terms and conditions of approval for Planned Development Districts shall be enforceable in the same manner as any other provision of this Land Development Ordinance for Lanier County. Violations shall be punishable as provided in the Code of Ordinances of Lanier County for each separate offense.

                  Generalized Wetlands Map [means] the current U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory Maps for Lanier County, Georgia. 
                  Hazardous Waste means any solid waste which has been defined as a hazardous waste in regulations, promulgated by the administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to the federal act, which are in force and effect on February 1, 1988, codified as 40 CFR 261.3. 
                  Jurisdictional Wetland [means] an area that meets the definitional requirements for wetlands as determined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
                  Jurisdictional Wetland Determination [means] a delineation of jurisdictional wetlands boundaries by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, 33 USC Subscript 1344, as amended. 
                  Natural Vegetative Buffer means a river corridor containing the flora native to that area. The natural floras for specific areas are described in Georgia Geologic Survey Bulletin 114, "the Natural Environments of Georgia." Habitats for endangered and threatened species may require human management of the river corridor in order to maintain those species. 
                  Pollution Susceptibility means the relative vulnerability of an aquifer to being polluted from spills, discharges, leaks, impoundments, applications of chemicals, injections and other human activities in the recharge area. 
                  Pollution Susceptibility Map means maps of relative vulnerability to pollution prepared by the Department of Natural Resources, using the DRASTIC methodology. (Georgia Department of Natural Resources Hydrologic Atlas 20: Groundwater Pollution Susceptibility Map of Georgia.) 
                  Recharge Area means any portion of the earth's surface, where water infiltrates into the ground to replenish an aquifer. 
                  Regulated Activity [means] any activity which will, or which may reasonably be expected to, result in the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the U.S. excepting those activities exempted in Section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act. 
                  River/Stream Bank [means] the rising ground, bordering a river or a stream, which serves to confine the water to the natural channel during the normal course of flow. 
                  Significant Recharge Areas means those areas mapped by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources in Hydrologic Atlas 18 (1989 edition). 
                  Single-family Dwelling means a dwelling structure that is designed for the use of one family. 
                  Utility [means and includes] public, private water or sewer piping systems, water or sewer pumping stations, electric power lines, fuel pipelines, telephone lines, roads, driveways, bridges, river/lake access facilities, storm water systems and railroads or other utilities identified by a local government. 
                  Water Resource Districts [mean] a mapped area which imposes a set of requirements and/or specific development standards or use restrictions. 
                  Wetlands [mean] those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas. The ecological parameters for designating wetlands include hydric soils, hydrophytic vegetation, and hydrological conditions that involve a temporary or permanent source of water to cause soil saturation. 
                  10-4	Groundwater Recharge Area District. 
                  10-4.1	Findings of Fact. Recharge areas are vulnerable to urban development activities as well as agricultural activities. Pesticides, herbicides sprayed on crops, animal waste and septic tank effluents contribute to a deterioration in the groundwater quality and can threaten the health of residents relying on well water. Development usually means an increase in the amount of land covered with impervious surfaces. Paving land in recharge areas can alter or impair their recharge characteristics thereby decreasing groundwater supplies. 
                  10-4.2	Purpose. The purpose of this district is to establish criteria to protect significant groundwater recharge areas from pollution by spills, discharges, leaks, impoundments, application of chemicals, injections and other development pressures. 
                  10-4.3	District Delineation. The groundwater recharge area protection map is delineated according to the Georgia Department of Natural Resources' "Most Significant Groundwater Recharge Areas of Georgia, Hydrologic Atlas 18 (1989 Edition)" and the Georgia Department of Natural Resources "Groundwater Pollution Susceptibility Map of Georgia, Hydrologic Atlas 20, 1992 Edition". Standards for this district shall comply with the DNR Rule 391-3-16-02, Criteria for the Protection of Groundwater Recharge Areas. 
                  10-4.4	Permitted Uses. The following are requirements for specific uses in the Groundwater Recharge Area Protection District: 
                  A.	All above-ground chemical or petroleum storage tanks, having a minimum volume of 660 gallons, shall have secondary containment for 110% of the volume of such tanks or 110% of the volume of the largest tank in a cluster of tanks. Such tanks used for agricultural purposes are exempt, provided they comply with all Federal requirements.

                  H.	Permanent storm water infiltration basins shall not be constructed in areas having high pollution susceptibility. 
                  I.	Any new wastewater treatment basin shall have an impermeable liner.
                  10-5	Alapaha River Corridor Protection District. 
                  10-5.1	Description of District. The limits of the Alapaha River Corridor Protection District are hereby defined to be all land inclusive of islands, in areas of the Alapaha River and being within 100 feet horizontally on both sides of the river as measured from the river banks. This area shall remain in an undisturbed vegetative buffer. The 100-foot buffer is measured from the uppermost part of the river bank, usually marked by a break in slope. Although not within the buffer area, the area between the top of the river bank and the water's edge shall be included in the district. 
                  [A.]	Because stream channels move due to natural processes such as meandering, river bank erosion, and jumping of channels, the river corridor may shift with time. To address this potential, local staff will require that all applicants submit a site plan, prepared on a plat or survey, upon which the applicant or his design specialist has designated the river bank. Local planning/inspections staff will verify the river bank on site, and ensure its proper delineation on the site plan. The required 100-foot buffer will be clearly delineated on the plat and enforced as a part of the local inspections process. 
                  [B.]	The Alapaha River Corridor Protection District is not intended to prescribe a specific land use but rather, to define a range of acceptable land uses. Within the range of uses which can be located within the District, this Section establishes performance standards which apply to development within the District. 
                  10-5.2	Intent. The intent of the regulations within this River Corridor Protection District is to limit the use of the Alapaha River Corridor, in conjunction with other governmental entities along the Alapaha River Corridor, in order to: 
                  A.	Ensure that the section of the river in Lanier County will not become polluted and unsuitable as a source for potable water; 
                  B.	Protect the river corridor by establishing a natural vegetative buffer area bordering the river; 
                  C.	Preserve those qualities that make the river corridor suitable as a habitat for wildlife; and 
                  D.	Help control erosion and to absorb flood waters.
                  The further intent of this district is to protect and safeguard the health and welfare of all the citizens of Lanier and adjacent counties by providing protection of the section of the river that is or may be used as a future source of drinking water. 
                  10-5.3	Conditions and Performance Standards. Within the River Corridor Protection District, the following conditions and performance standards shall apply: 
                  10-5.4	Permitted Uses.

                  C.	Utilities, (except as discussed above in section 10-5.4(B). If such utilities cannot feasibly be located outside the buffer area (feasibility shall be decided conservatively by the local government), provided that: 
                  1)	The utilities shall be located as far from the riverbank as reasonably possible.
                  2)	Installation and maintenance of the utilities shall be such as to protect the integrity of the buffer area as well as is reasonably possible. 
                  3)	Utilities shall not impair the drinking quality of the river water.
                  D.	Specific forestry and agricultural activities except as discussed above in sections 10-5.4(C) and 10-5.4(H). 
                  10-5.7	Restoration of Buffer. The natural vegetative buffer shall be restored as quickly as possible following any land-disturbing activity or construction within the river corridor related to the acceptable uses above. 
                  10-5.8	Construction Prohibited. Except as noted above, all construction within the buffer area shall be prohibited. 
                  10-6	Wetlands District. 
                  10-6.1	Findings of Fact. The wetlands in Lanier County, Georgia are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion, and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; and open space and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well-being of many communities within the State of Georgia. Nationally, a considerable number of these important natural resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution and other acts. Piece meal or cumulative losses will, over time, destroy additional wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare. 
                  10-6.2	Purpose. The purpose of this ordinance is to promote wetlands protection, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational and aesthetic values. Activities that may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree as practicable as determined through a permitting process. 
                  10-6.3	Establishment of the Wetlands Protection District. The Wetlands Protection District is hereby established which shall correspond to all lands within the jurisdiction of Lanier County, Georgia that are mapped as wetland areas by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory Maps. This map shall be referred to as the Generalized Wetlands Map and is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this ordinance, together with all explanatory matter thereon and attached thereto. The Generalized Wetlands Map does not represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within Lanier County, Georgia and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this ordinance does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements. 
                  10-6.4	Requirement for Local Permit or Permission. No regulated activity will be permitted within the Wetlands Protection District without written permission or a permit from Lanier County, Georgia. If the area proposed for development is located within 50 feet of a Wetlands Protection District boundary, as determined by the Building Official and/or his designee using the Generalized Wetlands Map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required. If the Corps determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site, the local permit or permission will not be granted until a Section 404 Permit or Letter of Permission is issued. 
                  10-6.5	Permitted Uses. The following uses shall be allowed as of right within the Wetlands Protection District to the extent that they are no prohibited by any other ordinance or law, including laws of trespass, and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining, or dredging except as provided herein. (The activities listed in this section are exempted from Section 404 regulations provided they do not have impacts on a navigable waterway that would necessitate acquisition of an individual 404 permit. However, under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act, a permit may be required in some circumstances.) 
                  A.	Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish and other wildlife, provided it does not affect waters of Georgia or of the United States in such a way that would require an individual 404 Permit. 
                  B.	Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding, and canoeing. 
                  C.	Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the Georgia Forestry Commission and as specified in Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. 
                  D.	The cultivation of agricultural crops. Agricultural activities shall be subject to best management practices approved by the Georgia Department of Agriculture. 
                  E.	The pasturing of livestock, provided that riparian wetlands are protected, that soil profiles are not disturbed and that approved agricultural Best Management Practices are followed. 
                  F.	Education, scientific research, and nature trails.
                  10-6.6	Prohibited Uses. The following uses are not permitted within the Wetlands Protection District: 
                  A.	Receiving areas for toxic or hazardous waste or other contaminants;
                  B.	Hazardous or sanitary waste landfills.
                  10-7	Special Administration and Enforcement Procedures for Water Resource Protection Districts. Any applications for building permits shall be accompanied by two (2) site plans drawn to scale showing the actual dimensions of the lot to be built upon, the size and location of the proposed buildings, and any proposed land disturbing activities as may be essential for determining whether the provisions of this ordinance are being observed. The above referenced information is required on the site plan before the site plan is considered by the Building Official and/or his designee and any local permits are approved. Any building permit shall become void if the work involved has not begun within six (6) months after the date of issuance of the permit or if the work or development authorized by such permit is suspended or abandoned for a period of six (6) months after the work or development is commenced; provided that extensions of time and periods not exceeding six (6) months each may be allowed in writing by the Building Official and/or his designee.

                  11-1	Land Development Administrator. An administrative official designated as the Land Development Administrator by the Board of Commissioners, Lanier County, Georgia, shall administer and enforce the provisions of this ordinance. 
                  11-2	Building/Development Permit Required. A building/development permit issued by the Land Development Administrator is required in advance of the initiation of construction, erection, moving, demolition, or alteration of any building or structure or any land development. No building or development permit shall be issued except in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance; however, a building permit issued before the adoption of this ordinance shall remain valid with the same qualifications as issued under this ordinance. 
                  11-3	Application for Building/Development Permit. All applications for building/development permits, except single-family residential, duplexes and agricultural buildings not intended for human occupancy, and their accessory uses shall be accompanied by two (2) site plans drawn to scale showing the actual dimensions of the lot to be built upon, the size and location of the lot, the number of dwelling units the building is designed to accommodate, the setback lines of the building on the "permit lot," the various easements on the lot and such other information as may be essential for determining whether the provisions of this ordinance are being observed. The following is required on the site plan before the site plan is considered by the Land Development Administrator and any permits are approved (single-family residential, duplexes and agricultural buildings, and their accessory uses are excluded from the following items except number 3 below): 
                  1.	Topography (MSL) existing and proposed.
                  2.	Drainage plans.
                  3.	Location and size of ingress/egress.
                  4.	Water mains and services, both existing and proposed.
                  5.	Water services as well as fire hydrants in the lot and the specific meter size and location. 
                  Any building/development permit shall become void if the work involved has not begun within six (6) months after the date of issuance of the permit or if the work or development authorized by such permit is suspended or abandoned for a period of six (6) months after the work or development is commenced; provided that extensions of time and periods not exceeding six (6) months each may be allowed in writing by the Land Development Administrator. Any unapproved deviation from the site plan shall cause the Land Development Administrator to not issue a Certificate of Occupancy. 
                  Single-family residential, duplexes and agricultural buildings, and their accessory uses, site plans need not be drawn to scale, but must be accurate as to dimensions of lot and proposed building. 
                  The applicant for a building/development permit shall submit a certificate with his application which certifies that the lot which he proposes to develop is a lot of record. When the lot in question does not meet the lot width and lot area requirements of this ordinance, then the applicant shall certify that such lot was a lot of record prior to the adoption of this ordinance or is a lot which has been created through governmental taking of property. 
                  All applications for a building/development permit shall be closely coordinated with Lanier County's Soil and Sedimentation and Erosion Control Ordinance. 
                  11-3.1	Coordination with Development of Regional Impact Requirements. The Georgia Department of Community Affairs, pursuant to the Georgia Planning Act, has established criteria for the identification of certain large scale developments which have the potential to cause land use impacts beyond the boundaries of the respective local government where a project might be proposed. These developments, known as Developments of Regional Impact (DRIs), shall be submitted, based on established DCA standards, procedures, and format, to the South Georgia Regional Development Center (SGRDC) for review and recommendation prior to issuance of any local building or development permit or utility tap (does not apply to any activity reviewed under any earlier land development district amendment.) As such, these requirements establish an official delay in the local permitting and/or review process to allow for compliance with these requirements. 
                  11-3.2	Coordination with Water Resource District Requirements. As identified in Section 10, Water Resource Districts, Lanier County contains three identified water resources: Groundwater Recharge Areas, River Corridor Protection Areas, and Potential Wetlands Areas. The Groundwater Recharge Areas, Protected River Corridor segments and generalized wetlands are available as digital overlays. Prior to issuance of any local building/development permits, these databases shall be checked, and if any are found applicable to the subject project or property, all requirements of Section 10, Water Resource Districts, shall be enforced as part of the permitting process. 
                  11-3.3	Reserved. 
                  11-4	Activities to Comply with Site Plan. All development activities or site work conducted after approval of the site plan shall conform with the specifications of said site plan.

Each day of continued violation shall be considered a separate offense. When removal of vegetative cover, excavation or fill has taken place in violation of this ordinance, the violator may be required to restore the affected land to its original contours and to restore vegetation, as far as practicable, at the discretion of the Land Development Administrator and/or his designee. Such actions shall be closely coordinated with U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' supervision. If the Land Development Administrator and/or his designee discovers a violation of this ordinance that also constitutes a violation of provisions of the Clean Water Act as amended, the Land Development Administrator or his designee may issue written notification of the violation to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the landowner. 
                  11-6	Enforcement. The Magistrate's Court of Lanier County shall have jurisdiction over violators of this ordinance and all procedures for enforcement of such ordinance shall be as provided in Article 4, Chapter 10 of Title 15, Official Code of Georgia. Complaints of violations of any provision of this ordinance shall be brought before the Magistrate's Court by the Land Development Administrator or his designated representative and shall be prosecuted through that court. 
                  11-7	Remedies. In case any building or structure is or is proposed to be erected, constructed, reconstructed, altered, converted, or maintained, or any building, structure, or land is or is proposed to be used in violation of these regulations, the Land Development Administrator, County Attorney, or other appropriate county authority or any adjacent or neighboring property owner or occupant who would be damaged by such violation may, in addition to other remedies, institute injunction, mandamus, or other appropriate action or proceedings to prevent such unlawful erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, conversion, maintenance, or use; or to correct or abate such violation, or to prevent the occupancy of said building, structure, or land. 
                  11-8	Complaints Regarding Violations. When a violation of this Ordinance occurs, or is alleged to have occurred, any person may file a written complaint. Such complaint shall state fully the causes and basis thereof and shall be filed with the Land Development Administrator. He shall record properly such complaint, investigate within thirty (30) days and take action thereon as provided in these regulations. 
                  11-9	Cancellation of Permits. A demolition, building, or development permit shall be canceled by the Land Development Administrator when the method of demolition, construction, or use violates any provision contained in these regulations, or any state or local ordinance or resolution. Upon such cancellation, any further work upon the demolition, construction, alteration, or repair on said building or structure, and any further use of said building or structure or land, shall be deemed a violation. Each and every day such unlawful demolition, construction, alteration, or repair on said building or structure, or further use of said building or structure or land continues shall be deemed a separate offense. 
                  11-10	Certificate of Occupancy. Certificate of Occupancy shall be issued by the Land Development Administrator in accordance with the following provisions: 
                  11-10.1	Certificate of Occupancy Required. A Certificate of Occupancy issued by the Land Development Administrator is required in advance of occupancy or use of: 
                  a.	A building hereafter erected.

                  c.	Any building or premises where a change in the type of use will occur.
                  11-10.2	Issuance of Certificate of Occupancy. Upon payment of all required fees, the Land Development Administrator shall sign and issue a Certificate of Occupancy if the proposed use of land or building is found to conform to the applicable provisions of this ordinance, and if the building, as finally constructed, substantially complies with the sketch or plan submitted and approved for the building permit. One (1) copy of all Certificates of Occupancy issued which contain a statement of the intended use of the applicable property and other pertinent information, signed by the owner or his agent shall be kept on file in the office of the Land Development Administrator. 
                  11-10.3	Denial of Certificate of Occupancy.

The Lanier County Board of Appeals hereinafter referred to as the "Board" shall consist of three (3) members residing within Lanier County, Georgia. The members shall be appointed by the Board of Commissioners, Lanier County, Georgia. None of the Board members shall hold any other public office, except that one appointed member may also be a member of the Planning Commission. Board members may be removable for cause, upon written charges, and after public hearing. Any member of the Board shall be disqualified to act upon a matter before the Board with respect to property in which the member has an interest.

                  12-1.2	Term of Office. The term of office for each member of the Board shall be for five (5) years; however, in the appointment of the first Board, two (2) of the members shall be appointed for three (3) years and one for five (5) years.

No appeal requesting the same relief in regard to the same property shall be received or heard by the Board for a period of twelve (12) months following the date of said motion, except that this limitation shall not affect the right of said Board to grant a rehearing if provided in the rules of procedure adopted by said Board.

                  12-4.2	Legal Proceedings Stayed. An appeal stays all legal proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the Land Development Administrator certifies to the Board after the notice of appeal shall have been filed with him, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life and property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the Board or by a court of record on application, on notice to the Land Development Administrator, and on due cause shown. 
                  12-4.3	Presentation of Evidence.

                  12-6.2	Request for a Variance. The Board may authorize upon appeal in specific cases such variance from the terms of these regulations as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of provisions of these regulations will, in an individual case, result in unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of these regulations shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. Provided, however, that a variance shall not be granted for a use of land or building or structure that is prohibited by this ordinance in the district in question. Such variance may be granted in an individual case upon finding by the board that all of the following exists: 
                  a.	There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape, or topography; 
                  b.	The application of these regulations to this particular piece of property would create an unnecessary hardship; 
                  c.	Such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of property involved;
                  d.	Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purposes and intent of these regulations; provided that no variance may be granted for a use of land, building or structure that is prohibited by this ordinance. Applications for use variances shall not be accepted by the Land Development Administrator. Such requests shall be properly filed as requests for land development districts amendment, the authority for such being solely reserved for the Lanier County Commission; and 
                  e.	Provided that the Board of Appeals may impose or require such additional restrictions and standards (i.e., increased setbacks, buffer strips, screening, etc.) as may be necessary to protect the health and safety of residents and workers in the community, and to protect the value and use of property in the general neighborhood. Provided, that whenever the Board of Appeals shall find, in the case of any permit granted pursuant to the provisions of these regulations that any of the terms, conditions or restrictions upon which such permit was granted are not being complied with, said Board shall rescind and revoke such permit after giving due notice to all parties concerned and granting full opportunity for public hearing. 
                  12-6.3	Request for Extension of Non-Conforming Residential Uses. The Board may authorize upon appeal in specific cases an extension or replacement of an existing non-conforming residential use which the Board is specifically authorized to pass on under the terms of this ordinance. Said extension may be granted in an individual case upon finding by the Board that: 
                  a.	The use is a non-conforming use as defined in these regulations;
                  b.	the use is in full compliance with all requirements of these regulations applicable to non-conforming uses; 
                  c.	the extension of said use will not further injure a permitted use on adjacent property in the same district; and 
                  d.	This section is specifically designed to allow for the replacement of homeowner occupied residential units in areas no longer zoned for residential uses. As such, this provision is not subject to the limits of Section 8-5.

                  Sec. 13. - Amendment. 
                  13-1	General Conditions. These regulations, including the official land development districts map, may be amended by the Board of Commissioners on their own motion, on petition of a property owner or his duly authorized agent, or on recommendation of the Planning Commission, but no amendment shall become effective unless it shall have been proposed by or shall first have been submitted to the Planning Commission for review and recommendation. Before enacting an amendment to these regulations, the governing authority shall give public notice and hold a public hearing thereon as set forth in this section. 
                  13-1.1	Establishment of Comprehensive Plan. The 2015 Greater Lanier Comprehensive Plan, as duly amended, is established as official policy of Lanier County. As such, the goals and policies of the Plan, and the resultant Future Land Use Plan, shall serve as the guide under which the unincorporated areas of the county are divided into land development districts. The recommendations of the Plan are hereby established as official policy of the county, and shall receive due consideration in all land development districts reclassification requests. 
                  13-1.2	Limited Use Provision. The Lanier County Board of Commissioners establishes the "Limited Use" provision for the purpose of allowing an applicant to request that a certain area be designated as a limited use. In some areas of the county, a specific land use activity out of a general land development classification may have less community impact than some of the possibilities of use in that specific land development district. For this reason, an applicant may request in his development petition to limit the use of a proposed property to a specified use only (for example, R-C LU - Rural Commercial District limited to a bait and tackle store.) The requested limited use must be among the uses permitted in the land development district classification for which the limited use is requested. Alteration or change of an approved limited use shall be treated as any normal land development amendment. 
                  13-1.3	Special Conditions Limitations. An applicant may file site plans, renderings, construction specifications, written development restrictions and other site planning or development conditions which the applicant proposes as binding conditions upon the development and use of the property involved in the application. Should the application be approved with these conditions, any alteration or change of a special conditions limitation shall be treated as any normal land development district amendment. 
                  13-2	Application for Amendment. 
                  13-2.1	General. Applications for amendment of these regulations may be in the form of proposals for amendment of the text of these regulations, proposals for amendment of the land development districts map or requests for Special Exception approval. Applications for amendment shall be submitted to the Land Development Administrator and shall include a fee payable to the county to defray expenses as set from time to time by the County Commission. No application for a land development district amendment affecting the same parcel of property or part thereof shall be accepted by the Land Development Administrator until the expiration of at least twelve months immediately following the denial of the development district amendment request by the Lanier County Commission.

                  d.	Public Hearing Procedure. All public hearings on land development matters shall be placed on the County Commission agenda under a section entitled "Public Hearings". The County Commission Chairman, or his designee, shall officially declare the public hearing open and shall note that Lanier County's written Public Hearing Procedures, Lanier County's Standards for Exercise of Land Development Powers, and a copy of Georgia's Conflict of Interest Law are available to the attending public as a handout and are posted for public review. 
                  The Land Development Administrator and/or designee shall then announce the matter for consideration. The Chairman shall then call for acknowledgment of a potential conflict of interest by members of the Commission. (See Subsection 13-2.9h) The Land Development Administrator will then report the staff recommendation and the recommendation of the Greater Lanier Planning Advisory Commission. The Chairman shall then allow public input. General procedures to be followed will require citizen comments to be heard in an orderly fashion. Citizens speaking in favor of the request shall be heard first, followed by those opposed to the issue. All speakers will be asked to provide his or her name and address for the public record. Citizens are requested to keep their comments as brief as possible so that all who wish to be heard will have adequate time. Where there is a large number of citizens wishing to testify at a given hearing, the presiding officer may invoke reasonable time limitations on both the proponents and opponents of a request. In such cases, these time limits shall apply to both sides of an issue equally, such minimum time period to be no less than ten minutes per side. Citizens shall address their comments to the County Commission as a whole. Individual attacks or cross examination of Commission members, county employees or other citizens will be ruled out of order. The Commission retains the privilege to ask any questions of staff or any citizen present for clarification. 
                  After all citizen comments have been received, all further discussion of the specific application is reserved for the County Commission. The Chairman shall then declare the public hearing closed and no further public comment will be entertained. The County Commission will then render a decision on the application. So that the purpose of this Ordinance will be served, health, public safety, and general welfare secured, the County Commission may approve the application, reduce the land area for which the application is made, change the district requested, add or delete conditions of the application, deny an application, or defer consideration of an application to acquire additional information. An action by the Commission to defer the application shall include a statement of the date and time of the next meeting at which the application will be considered, which statement shall constitute public notice of the hearing on the application and no further notice is required. In the case of tabling of a matter, no further public comment will be entertained upon further consideration of the matter. 
                  When, in the opinion of the County Commission, the official public hearing has brought forth substantial new evidence or testimony not available to the Greater Lanier Planning Advisory Commission at the time of their review of a land development matter, or should the Commission desire to request further study by the Planning Commission of a particular aspect of an application, it shall be the policy of the Commission to table the issue and request that the Planning Commission restudy the issue and affirm or amend its recommendation, which action shall be reported to the County Commission prior to making a final decision. 
                  e.	Standards for Exercise of Land Development Powers. In order to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of Lanier County against the unrestricted use of property, the following standards, and other factors relevant to balancing the above stated public interests shall be considered as they apply to any application brought before the Planning Commission or the County Commission for a land development decision: 
                  1.	Is the proposed land development or use suitable in view of the land development and development of adjacent and nearby property? 
                  2.	Does the request represent the possible creation of an isolated district unrelated to adjacent and nearby districts and will the proposed use adversely affect the existing use or usability of adjacent or nearby property? 
                  3.	Will the proposed use cause an excessive or burdensome use of public facilities or services, including but not limited to streets, schools, water, sewer, or other public utilities, including police and fire protection? 
                  4.	Is the proposed use supported by new or changing conditions not anticipated by the Comprehensive Plan or is the proposed use compatible and consistent with the purpose and intent of the Comprehensive Plan? 
                  5.	Will the proposed change adversely influence existing conditions in the neighborhood or the city or county at large and are there substantial reasons why the property cannot or should not be used as currently districted? 
                  6.	Are there potential adverse impacts on the environment, including but not limited to drainage, soil erosion and sedimentation, flooding, air quality, and water quality and quantity?

                  8.	Will the proposed change be detrimental to the value or improvement of development of adjacent or nearby property in accordance with existing requirements and development standards? 
                  9.	Is the proposed change out of scale with the needs of the neighborhood or Lanier County or does the request reflect a reasonable balance between the promotion of the public health, safety, morality, or general welfare and the right to unrestricted use of property? 
                  10.	Will the proposed change constitute a grant of special privilege to the individual owner as contrasted with the adjacent or nearby neighborhood or with the general public? 
                  f.	Standards for Special Exception Review. In addition to the standards enumerated in subsection (e) above, the following additional standards shall be considered for Special Exception requests:

                  4.	Are refuse, service parking and loading areas on the property located or screened to protect other properties in the area from such adverse effects as noise, light glare and other negative impacts? 
                  5.	Will the hours and manner of operation of the Special Exception use have no adverse impacts on other properties in the area? 
                  6.	Will the height, size or location of the buildings or other structures on the property be compatible with the height, size or location of buildings or other structures on neighboring properties? 
                  7.	Provided, that the County Commission may impose or require such additional restrictions and standards as may be necessary to protect the health and safety of workers and residents in the community, and to protect the value and use of property in the general neighborhood; and provided that wherever the County Commission shall find in the case of any permit granted pursuant to the provisions of these regulations that any term, condition or restrictions upon which such permit was granted are not being complied with, said County Commission shall rescind and revoke such permit after giving due notice to all parties concerned and granting full opportunity for a public hearing. 
                  8.	Special Exceptions granted by the County Commission shall be executed within a twelve month period or become null and void and subject to procedures for resubmission. 
                  g.	Public Hearings Records Standards. The County Clerk shall mechanically record the proceedings of all land development public hearings. If requested by any party, verbatim transcripts of the public hearing can be prepared, but only if requested and purchased in advance by the requesting party, who must arrange at his expense for a certified court reporter to record and transcribe the hearing and furnish the original of the transcript to the Commission for its records. The record of the public hearing and all evidence (e.g., maps, drawings, traffic studies, etc.) submitted at the public hearing shall be noted as such and shall become a permanent part of the particular land development amendment file.
