         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE                   This Code constitutes a codification of the general and permanent ordinances of Madison County, Georgia. 
                  This 2012 republication was under the direct supervision of Eric Grant, Vice-President Supplement Department, and Connie Hamilton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for the sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
                  The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Rhonda Wooten, Administrative Assistant, and Michael C. Pruett, County Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this republication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the county readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the county's affairs. 
                  Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances adopted by the board of commissioners. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any ordinance included herein. 
                  This 2012 republication includes all amendatory legislation through an ordinance adopted August 27, 2012, and was accomplished under the supervision of Connie Hamilton, Editor. 
                  The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
                  Chapter and Section Numbering System 
                  The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
                  Page Numbering System 
                  The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

                   
                  Indexes 
                  The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
                  Looseleaf Supplements 
                  A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
                  Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.

               (d)  Any part of Madison County which is described in subsection (b) of this section as being in a particular district shall nevertheless not be included within such district if such part is not contiguous to such district. Such noncontiguous part shall instead be included within that district contiguous to such part which contains the least population according to the United States decennial census of 2010 for the State of Georgia.

               Section 6. - Reserved. 
               Editor's note— Res. of 06-05-2017(1) , adopted June 5, 2017, repealed § 6, which pertained to [executive or secret meetings] and derived from 1966 Ga. Laws 2667. 
               Section 7. - [Quorum.] 
               Three members of the board, not including the chairperson, shall constitute a quorum and no action shall be taken by the board without the concurring vote of at least three members. A majority vote of the entire board will control the determination of all policies on the board. All members of the board other than the chairperson shall be required to vote on all questions coming before the board unless a member shall be disqualified to vote thereon because of conflict of interest or other legal reason. The chairperson shall be the executive administrator of all policies of the board and shall be authorized to vote only to break a tie vote, unless the chairperson shall be disqualified to vote thereon because of conflict of interest or other legal reason. The chairperson shall have authority, with the concurrence and approval of a majority of the members of the board, to employ all personnel and county employees and such clerical help as is necessary, in their judgment, to conduct the affairs of the office properly, and at such salaries as they may deem proper. 
               (1988 Ga. Laws (Act No. 1044), page 4692, § 2; 1992 Ga. Laws (Act No. 648), page 4873, § 1; 1997 Ga. Laws (Act No. 238), page 4095, § 2) 
               Section 8. - [Chairman.] 
               The chairman shall act as county treasurer and shall have all the duties imposed by law upon the treasurer except such duties as may be in conflict with the duties specifically imposed herein, but no additional salary shall be allowed for such position as treasurer. 
               Section 9. - [Salary.] 
               (a)  [Generally.] 
               (1)  The chairperson of the board of commissioners of Madison County shall receive an annual salary in an amount equal to the annual salary now or hereafter received by the sheriff of Madison County; provided, however, that the chairperson shall receive an annual cost-of-living increase in salary as provided in this subsection notwithstanding the fact that such increase results in a salary higher than that of the sheriff. The salary of the chairperson shall be payable in equal monthly installments from county funds. 
               (2)  Members of the board other than the chairperson shall receive a salary of $7,200.00 per annum, plus an additional $25.00 per month for each full year of service as commissioner, not to exceed an additional $300.00 per month. Such salary shall be payable in equal monthly installments from county funds. Members of the board of commissioners other than the chairperson shall receive the increase in compensation set out in this paragraph only after performing the following procedures; the board of commissioners shall advertise, at least seven days in advance, a public hearing on the subject of the increase in compensation; at such public hearing or another meeting of the board of commissioners after due notice that the increase in compensation will be discussed, the board shall adopt, by majority vote, a resolution setting out the board's request for such increase in compensation. Failure or refusal to follow these procedures in full will make the increase in compensation set out in this paragraph void and of no effect. 
               (3)  Whenever the employees in the classified service of the state merit system receive a cost-of-living increase of a certain percentage or a certain amount, the salaries of the chairperson and other members of the board shall be increased by the same percentage or same amount applicable to such state employees. If the cost-of-living increase received by the state employees is in different percentages or different amounts as to certain categories of employees, the salaries of the chairperson and other members of the board shall be increased by a percentage or an amount equal to the average percentage or average amount of the general increase in salary granted to the state employees. The periodic changes in the salaries of the chairperson and other members of the board shall become effective six months following the date that the cost-of-living increases received by state employees become effective. 
               (4)  The vice chairperson of the board of commissioners shall receive an additional $600.00 per year, payable in equal monthly installments from county funds. 
               (b)  [Travel expenses.] In addition to the salaries provided in subsection (a) of this section, each member of the board, including the chairman, may receive up to, but not in excess of, $1,000.00 per annum in travel expenses. Such travel expenses shall be paid only for out-of-county travel on county business at actual transportation cost while traveling by public carrier or actual miles traveled at the prevailing rate paid per mile by the State of Georgia for its employees when using a personal automobile. Each member shall be paid such travel expenses upon submitting to the clerk of the board a statement of such travel supported by proper vouchers. If a member of the board fails to incur $1,000.00 in travel expenses, such balance remaining shall not be carried over to the next calendar year.

                  (5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meanings of ordinance sections inserted into the Code; but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code.

                  Sec. 2-2. - Agenda. 
                  The chairman of the board of commissioners ("chair") will set the agenda for all meetings. Suggested agenda items must be submitted to the chair or the county clerk 12:00 p.m. Monday of the week immediately preceding the next scheduled agenda-setting meeting. The chair will accept all agenda requests timely submitted by an elected commissioner. The chair will consider and may accept agenda requests timely submitted by other elected and appointed officials, and by county department heads. 
                  (1)  Publication. One week prior to each scheduled meeting, a copy of all agenda items will be sent to the newspaper designated as the legal organ of Madison County. 
                  (2)  Debating format. Agenda items shall be debated only by members of the board (including the chair). A commissioner wishing to speak must be recognized by the chair prior to speaking. Comment or discussion from persons other than members of the board may be allowed by the chair if he, in his discretion, determines such comment would be constructive and germane to the discussion. 
                  (3)  Non-agenda items. The agenda of the agenda-setting meeting shall be established by the chair, as set forth above. The agenda of the business meeting shall be as approved by the board at the agenda-setting meeting. However, the agendas for both meetings shall contain an agenda item titled "urgent matters." This agenda item will provide members and the chairman an opportunity to raise issues which have arisen since publication of the agenda, and which require action prior to the next regular business meeting. The member raising the issue shall describe the matter, including an explanation of why it must be acted upon prior to the next regular business meeting, why it could not have been placed on the published agenda, and shall make a motion, or ask another member to make a motion to add the matter to the agenda. If, and only if, said motion is seconded and unanimously approved by all members in accordance, then the matter may be discussed and acted upon as if it had been included on the published agenda. This agenda item may be used only for genuinely urgent matters that were not foreseeable prior to the deadline for placing matters on the published agenda, and not to circumvent the agenda publication requirements of O.C.G.A. § 50-14-1(e)(i). This procedure is to be used sparingly and only for genuinely urgent matters. Its use shall not become a regular feature of meetings. 
                  (4)  Consent calendar. At its agenda-setting meeting, the board may place matters that are routine or non-controversial under an item titled "consent calendar" on the agenda of the business meeting. Those matters will be voted upon in gross and without debate at the business meeting, unless one or more commissioners (including the chair) objects thereto prior to that vote in the business meeting, in which case the matter(s) objected to will be deferred to the regular agenda of that same meeting for consideration in the same manner as any other regular agenda item. 
                  (5)  Personnel issues. When any matter is on the agenda concerning a personnel issue, the human resources manager shall provide or make available to the chairman and to each commissioner, at least three days prior to the meeting, copies of any and all pertinent documentation, including, but not limited to, the employment application of persons being recommended for hire. The agenda shall describe the nature of the issue (hiring, discipline, etc.) and name the affected department of county government. 
                  (6)  Citizen comment. All meetings shall conclude with a citizen comment period, in which any person may address the board on the topic(s) of his choice. Each speaker is allowed a maximum of three minutes to speak. Members of the board shall not question the speaker nor make comment until the speaker has concluded his presentation. Any comments of a personal, insulting or derogatory nature shall be ruled out of order by the chair, and the speaker will forfeit any remaining time to speak.

                  Madison County participates in the loss control and safety incentive program of the ACCG Group Self-Insurance Workers' Compensation Fund, through which workers' compensation coverage is provided to county employees. In accordance with the requirements of that program, department heads and elected officials are directed/encouraged to make efforts to return injured workers to employment as soon as reasonable and practicable. In situations where the employee's treating physician has determined that temporary physical limitations do not permit the employee's return to his previous job, such efforts should include providing "transitional employment" (i.e., temporary duties that are less strenuous than the employee's normal job duties) where reasonable and practicable.

                  Employees provided with telephones for their primary benefit are responsible for the usage of those, and must receive authorization from their supervisor for any use which results in additional telephone charges, including, but not limited to, directory assistance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, employees may be authorized by their department head to incur reasonable long distance charges in the performance of their official duties without receiving authorization for each individual call. Any charges incurred in violation of this policy may be tracked to the telephone used and charged to the employee for whose primary benefit that telephone is provided.

                  With the rising onset of health problems and the top three being high blood pressure, diabetes, and obesity, the chairman and board of commissioners have a growing concern for their employees' health and well-being. Therefore, Madison County is dedicated to helping employees reach optimal health and improve their quality of life. 
                  Madison County recognizes the benefits, to both employees and employers, of programs that promote and support workplace health/wellness. The Madison County Health and Wellness Program is designed to provide employees with the tools they need to make positive lifestyle changes. The program's goals are to: 
                  (1)  Provide educational resources that promote healthy lifestyles; 
                  (2)  Develop activities to support the well-being of employees; 
                  (3)  Address the primary components that lead to unhealthy lifestyles; 
                  (4)  Create a culture of health awareness. 
                  Madison County intends to promote these goals by supporting exercise programs and contests, holding educational seminars, sending monthly flyers and weekly e-mails with health tips, and providing rewards to those that reach their desired goals. 
                  As part of the commitment to wellness, a health promotion leader has been appointed and a wellness committee formed who will monitor and encourage participation, keep a record of points earned by each employee for their participation, evaluate the success of each program and ensure that rewards are given at the end of each grant year.

                  All employees are responsible for helping to assure we avoid harassment, and have the responsibility for reporting any occurrence of harassment, or sexual harassment. If you feel that you have experienced or witnessed harassment you are to notify, either, your immediate supervisor, the human resources manager, the chairman of the board of commissioners, or the county clerk. Reports are to be made as soon as practicable, and within 24 hours unless extraordinary circumstances do not permit, and preferably in writing. Oral reports, however, will also be taken in the case of unusually sensitive circumstances. The Madison County Board of Commissioners' policy is to investigate all such complaints. To the fullest extent practicable, the Madison County Board of Commissioners will keep complaints and the terms of their resolution confidential. If an investigation confirms that harassment has occurred, the Madison County Board of Commissioners will take corrective action in accordance with the nature and extent of the offense. The Madison County Board of Commissioners also prohibits retaliation against any employee bringing a claim of sexual harassment.

                  Sec. 2-141. - Overview. 
                  Certain Madison County employees may be provided with access to the Internet to assist them in performing their jobs. The computer system belongs to Madison County, acting by and through its duly elected board of commissioners, and may only be used for county business purposes. The Internet can be a valuable source of information and research. In addition, e-mail can provide an excellent means of communicating with other employees, our customers and citizens, outside vendors, and other businesses. Use of the Internet, however, must be tempered with common sense and good judgment. If you abuse your right to use the Internet, this privilege may be revoked. In addition, you may be subject to disciplinary action, including possible termination, and civil and criminal liability. 
                  Your use of the Internet is governed by this policy. 
                  (Ord. of 1-9-2012, § 9) 
                  Sec. 2-142. - Disclaimer of liability for use of the Internet. 
                  Madison County is not responsible for material viewed or downloaded by users from the Internet. The Internet is a worldwide network of computers that contains millions of pages of information. Users are cautioned that many of these pages include offensive, sexually explicit, and inappropriate material. In general, it is difficult to avoid at least some contact with this material while using the Internet. Even innocent search requests may lead to sites with highly offensive content. In addition, you may receive e-mail containing offensive material. E-mail or pop-ups containing offensive material received on county computers shall be immediately reported to the department head or elected official who shall maintain a log of such occurrences. Users accessing the Internet do so at their own risk. 
                  (Ord. of 1-9-2012, § 9(A)) 
                  Sec. 2-143. - Employee's duty of care. 
                  Employees should endeavor to make each electronic communication truthful and accurate. You should use the same care in drafting e-mail and other electronic documents as you would for any other written communication. Please keep in mind that anything created or stored on the computer system may and likely will, be reviewed by others. Any information stored on your computer constitutes a public record under the State Open Records Act. 
                  (Ord. of 1-9-2012, § 9(B)) 
                  Sec. 2-144. - Duty not to waste computer resources. 
                  Employees must not deliberately perform acts that waste computer resources or unfairly monopolize resources to the exclusion of others. These acts include, but are not limited to, sending mass mailings or chain letters, spending excessive amounts of time on the Internet, playing games, engaging in online chat groups, printing multiple copies of documents, or otherwise creating unnecessary network traffic. Because audio, video and picture files require significant storage space, files of this sort may not be downloaded unless they are business related. 
                  (Ord. of 1-9-2012, § 9(C)) 
                  Sec. 2-145. - Internet access guidelines. 
                  These guidelines set the standards for appropriate behavior of county employees when accessing the Internet using government resources. Remember that the county name goes with you as an electronic signature wherever you go on the Internet. County employees must exercise great care to protect the county reputation and ability to conduct business in all Internet activities. Activities of county Internet users are logged, including visits to inappropriate sites (erotica, hate groups, etc.), and reported to management as necessary. 
                  The ability to "surf the web" (i.e., select links to unknown sites) carries with it new responsibilities for each user. Security problems with browser software, Netscape or Internet Explorer, are continually reported. These problems are potentially more serious for a large organization, such as Madison County, than for an individual user on his or her home machine. To protect county assets: 
                  (1)  Never surf the web on a computer that has been identified as a computer that contains highly sensitive information, such as medical records or critical financial information. 
                  (2)  Ensure your browser is kept up-to-date with the most current security patches. 
                  (3)  Visit only known and trusted sites on the Internet. Monitor the URL (internet address) shown in the box at the top of your browser screen. These addresses typically take the form of http://www.site.com. If you are unsure about the safety of a site, contact your support group. 
                  (4)  Be aware that selecting some links on web pages or in your e-mail will automatically download "applets" which are small programs that will automatically run on your computer. What the applet appears to be doing on your screen may not be all that is happening. Hostile applets can exploit security holes to gather information from the user's machine, such as user password files and critical network information. 
                  (5)  Always close your browser when you have finished surfing the web. 
                  "Netiquette" is the practice of good manners in a networked environment and is critical to successful county business practices. Each county Internet user is viewed as a representative of Madison County and must exercise good netiquette. You must use good judgment in assessing what form of communication is appropriate for particular information. If you have questions or concerns, consult your supervisor, or the relevant department for the particular issue. 
                  (Ord. of 1-9-2012, § 9(D)) 
                  Sec. 2-146. - Activities which may result in disciplinary action. 
                  (a)  Using the computer system, including, but not limited to, accessing the Internet, for other than county business purposes. 
                  (b)  Visiting inappropriate web sites (erotica, hate groups, etc.). 
                  (c)  Unauthorized attempts to break into any computer whether it belongs to Madison County or another organization (cracking). 
                  (d)  Sending or posting threatening messages. 
                  (e)  Sending or posting racially and/or sexually harassing messages. 
                  (f)  Sending or posting sexually suggestive or explicit messages. 
                  (g)  Theft or copy of electronic files without permission. 
                  (h)  Sending or posting confidential information that is not part of your job requirement. 
                  (i)  Refusing to cooperate with a reasonable security investigation. 
                  Failure to comply with these guidelines may be brought to the attention of management for appropriate action, which may result in loss of Internet privileges or disciplinary action, including termination of employment. Violations of applicable laws or regulations (e.g., Computer Security Act, export control laws, copyright laws) could result in criminal or civil prosecution.

                  Sec. 2-147. - No expectation of privacy. 
                  The computers and the computer accounts given to county employees are to assist them in performance of their jobs. Employees do not have an expectation of privacy in anything they create, store, send or receive on the computer system. The computer system belongs to the county and may only be used for business purposes.

                  Sec. 2-148. - No privacy in communications. 
                  Employees should never consider electronic communications to be either private or secure. E-mail may be stored indefinitely on any number of computers, including that of the recipient. Copies of your messages may be forwarded to others either electronically or on paper. In addition, e-mail sent to nonexistent or incorrect usernames may be delivered to persons that you never intended.

                  The county may use software/hardware to identify inappropriate or sexually explicit Internet sites. Such sites may be blocked from access by county networks. Nonetheless, in the event you encounter inappropriate or sexually explicit material while browsing on the Internet, immediately disconnect from the site, regardless of whether the site was subject to county blocking software and immediately report the incident to your department head or elected official who shall maintain a log of such occurrences.

                  Sec. 2-151. - Prohibited activities. 
                  Material that is fraudulent, harassing, embarrassing, sexually explicit, profane, obscene, intimidating, defamatory, or otherwise unlawful or inappropriate may not be sent by e-mail or other forms of electronic communication (bulletin board systems, newsgroups, e-groups, chat groups), downloaded from the Internet, or displayed on or stored on Madison County computers.

                  Employees may not illegally copy material protected under copyright law or make that material available to others for copying. You are responsible for complying with copyright law and applicable licenses that may apply to software, files, graphics, documents, messages, and other material you wish to download or copy. You may not agree to a license or download any material for which a registration fee is charged without first obtaining the express written permission of your department head.

                  Sec. 2-155. - Accessing the Internet. 
                  To ensure security and avoid the spread of viruses, employees accessing the Internet through a computer attached to the Madison County network must do so through an approved Internet firewall.

                  County vehicles are provided to support county activities and are to be used only by qualified and authorized employees. They are not to be considered a part of an employee's compensation and must not be used as an inducement for employment. In all cases, these vehicles are to be operated in strict compliance with motor vehicle laws of the jurisdiction in which they are driven and with the utmost regard for their care and cost efficient use.

                  Sec. 2-186. - Maintenance. 
                  Authorized drivers are required to properly maintain their county vehicles at all times. Vehicles should not be operated with any defect that would inhibit safe operation during current and foreseeable weather and lighting conditions. Preventive maintenance such as regular oil changes, lubrication and tire pressure and fluid checks determine to a large extent whether you will have a reliable, safe vehicle to drive and support work activities. You should have preventive maintenance completed on your vehicle as required in the owner's manual. This service should be done at the Madison County Road Department.

The county does not assume any liability for bodily injuries or property damage the employee may become personally obligated to pay arising out of an accident occurring in connection with operation of his/her own car. The reimbursement to the employee for the operation of his/her car on county business includes the allowance for the expense of automobile insurance. You must have liability insurance as required by Georgia law. The county does not specify and assumes no responsibility for any other coverage employees carry on their own cars since this is a matter of individual status and preference.

                  Fines for parking or moving violations are the personal responsibility of the assigned operator. The county will not condone nor excuse ignorance of traffic citations that result in court summons being directed to itself as owner of the vehicle. 
                  Each driver is required to report all moving violations to their department head by the end of the work day. This requirement applies to violations involving the use of any vehicle (county, personal or other) while on county business. Failure to report violations will result in appropriate disciplinary action. 
                  Please be aware that traffic violations incurred during non-business (personal use) hours will affect your driving status as well and are subject to review.

                  Sec. 2-203. - Registration. 
                  Registration fees may be paid through accounts payable using an authorization for payment form or by charging to the county charge card, subject to the requirements of subsection 2-202(1) above. According to the purchasing policy, a purchase order is not required for the registration; however, a purchase order is preferred when using the county charge card.

                  Sec. 2-204. - Transportation. 
                  Employees should use a county vehicle when available. Gas for county-owned vehicles can be obtained through the county road department. Out-of-town gas purchases for county vehicles may be obtained using a county gas card.

Requests for reimbursement of said personal vehicle mileage must be made within 30 days of the date the expense was incurred. Employees will not be allowed to purchase gas for their personal vehicles using a county credit card, or from the county road department gas pumps. A county personal vehicle log sheet should be completed when requesting mileage for a personal vehicle. 
                  (1)  Direct expenses of operating a personal vehicle, such as gasoline, oil, parts, or repairs shall not be an allowable reimbursable county expense.

                  (a)  Lodging may be charged to the county's charge card, paid in advance (using an authorization for payment), or billed direct to the county. Should lodging need to be charged to a county credit card or paid in advance, it is expected that the employee will arrange to have these expenses handled directly by the county purchasing agent. 
                  (b)  Meals served at a hotel or motel may be billed to the employee's room and expensed to the county provided they meet the set meal rates provided. Phone calls charged to the room that are directly related to county business may also be expensed to the county. One personal "safe arrival call" is allowed. No other personal phone calls shall be allowed as reimbursable by Madison County. 
                  (c)  The following lodging-related items would not be allowed as reimbursable by Madison County: 
                  (1)  Entertainment expenses. 
                  (2)  Charges such as beach or pool rental items, movie rentals, or other "extra" services. 
                  (d)  Should an employee choose lodging arrangements other than those provided as part of the training or conference, the county will not be responsible for lodging-related reimbursements unless approved in advance. In such cases, a partial reimbursement may be considered if presented in advance (Example: if an employee chooses to stay at a $100.00-per-night hotel as opposed to staying at an $80.00-per-night location that is offered as part of the conference package, the employee can request reimbursement for up to $80.00 per night. Such requests should have approval of the department head/elected official.) Should lack of availability with a conference package hotel cause the employee to have to choose other lodging, the county will pay these alternate arrangements. Authorized lodging fee is standard room rate. The appropriate "sales and use tax certificate of exemption" and "hotel/motel tax exemption request" will support all lodging arrangements. These forms may be found in the appendix section of this policy. 
                  (e)  Parking fees shall be allowed as a reimbursable expense.

Unauthorized charges should not be charged to the county credit card even if it is the intention to reimburse these expenses. Unauthorized charges or charges failing to meet the criteria set forth in these or other county policies will be the responsibility of the employee. The county reserves the right to deduct any unauthorized charges from the employee's wages. 
                  (b)  Under no circumstances should an employee who has signed for a card allow another employee to use the card.

                  Purchasing methods. The total purchase amount of a purchase dictates the method to be used in the acquisition of the goods or services needed. There are four standard methods of purchasing. They are:

Multiple departmental purchase orders shall not be used to circumvent the purchasing process. 
                  (2)  Written price quotes. The purchasing agent and the user department shall, in consultation with one another, complete a quotation specification form. The quotation form shall include, among other items, a complete description with detailed specifications for the purchase. The department or the purchasing agent shall obtain written price quotes.

                  (Ord. of 1-9-2012(1), § F); Ord. of 2-6-2017(1) ) 
                  Sec. 2-248. - Formal sealed bid process. 
                  (a)  [Legal notice.] The formal sealed bid process requires a legal notice to be published in the county legal organ of general circulation.

                  (b)  Bid packet. A formal sealed bid information packet will be prepared and forwarded to all qualified vendors.

                  (d)  Award of bid. When a bid opening is scheduled for a time other than at a meeting of the board of commissioners, the county clerk shall prepare a summary and comparison of all bids submitted, a copy of which shall be provided to each commissioner prior to any scheduled vote on the award of the bid. Bids may be awarded only by vote of the Madison County Board of Commissioners. The county reserves the right to reject any and all bids.

The contractor shall furnish such other bonds or insurances as may be required by law, the county, or bid specifications. The type of bonds and insurances shall be set forth in the bid specifications. 
                  (g)  Request for bids (RFB). The RFB method will be used when detailed technical specifications can be developed. Examples are road paving, vehicle purchases and certain types of materials.

                  (j)  Request for proposal (RFP). The RFP method is a formal request made to obtain offers of price and plans for handling a project. This process is used when the expertise of the bidders will be relied on to develop a solution for the county and price may not be the deciding factor in the bid award. These transactions are subject to the formal sealed bid process and allow for negotiations in certain areas (scope) of the proposal following the bid opening. 
                  (k)  Request for quotation (RFQ). The RFQ method is a request sent to suppliers along with a description of the commodity or services needed and requires a response from the supplier by a predetermined date. Evaluation and recommendation for award should be based on the quotation that best meets price, quality, delivery, service, past performance, and reliability. These transactions may or may not be subject to the formal sealed bid process and further negotiations are usually unnecessary.

                  (a)  Exceptions. No dog shall be classified as a vicious dog or dangerous dog for actions that occur while the dog is being used by a law enforcement or military officer to carry out the law enforcement or military officer's official duties. No dog shall be classified as a vicious dog or a dangerous dog if the person injured by such dog was a person who at the time was committing a trespass, was abusing the dog, or was committing or attempting to commit an offense under O.C.G.A. ch. 5 of tit. 16. 
                  (b)  Enforcement generally. 
                  (1)  A person carrying out the duties of dog control officer shall not be authorized to make arrests unless the person is a law enforcement officer having the powers of arrest. 
                  (2)  Any county or municipality or any combination of such local governments may enter into agreements with each other for the consolidation of dog control services. 
                  (c)  Procedures.

                  b.  Mail means to send by certified mail or statutory overnight delivery to the recipient's last known address. 
                  (2)  Upon receiving a report of a dog believed to be subject to classification as a vicious dog or dangerous dog within a dog control officer's jurisdiction, the dog control officer shall make such investigations as necessary to determine whether such dog is subject to classification as a vicious dog or a dangerous dog. 
                  (3)  When a dog control officer determines that a dog is subject to classification as a vicious dog or dangerous dog, the dog control officer shall mail a dated notice to the dog's owner within 72 hours. Such notice shall include a summary of the dog control officer's determination and shall state that the owner has a right to request a hearing from the authority on the dog control officer's determination within seven days after the date shown on the notice. The notice shall also provide a form for requesting the hearing and shall state that if a hearing is not requested within the allotted time, the dog control officer's determination shall become effective for all purposes under this article. 
                  a.  If an owner cannot be located within ten days of a dog control officer's determination that a dog is subject to classification as a vicious dog or dangerous dog, such dog may be released to an animal shelter or humanely euthanized, as determined by the dog control officer. 
                  (4)  When a hearing is requested by a dog owner in accordance herewith, such hearing shall be scheduled within 30 days after the request is received; provided, however, that such hearing may be continued by the authority for good cause shown. At least ten days prior to the hearing, the authority conducting the hearing shall mail to the dog owner written notice of the date, time, and place of the hearing. At the hearing, the dog owner shall be given the opportunity to testify and present evidence and the authority conducting the hearing shall receive other evidence and testimony as may be reasonably necessary to sustain, modify, or overrule the dog control officer's determination. 
                  (5)  Within ten days after the hearing, the authority which conducted the hearing shall mail written notice to the dog owner of its determination on the matter. If such determination is that the dog is a vicious dog or a dangerous dog, the notice of classification shall specify the date upon which that determination shall be effective. If the determination is that the dog is to be euthanized pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 4-8-26, the notice shall specify the date by which the euthanasia shall occur. 
                  (6)  Judicial review of the authority's final decision may be had in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 15-9-30.9.

All fines and all charges for service performed by a law enforcement or dog control officer shall be paid prior to owner recovery of the dog. Criminal prosecution shall not be stayed due to owner recovery or euthanasia of the dog. 
                  (3)  In the event the owner has not complied with these within 14 days of the date the dog was confiscated, such dog shall be released to an animal shelter, as such term is defined in O.C.G.A. § 4-14-2, or euthanized in an expeditious and humane manner. The owner may be required to pay the costs of housing and euthanasia. 
                  (e)  Court-ordered euthanasia.

The owner of the dog shall be responsible for all expenses incurred in caring for the dog while so impounded.

The notice shall be provided by personal service, registered mail or certified mail.

                  (c)  If the owner of a dog impounded fails to respond in writing within five business days of the date the notice of impoundment was served, or, if the owner is unknown or could not be found within 30 days of publication of the notice of impoundment, the impounded dog may be disposed of as provided in O.C.G.A. §4-11-9.6. 
                  (d)  If the owner of a dog impounded refuses to enter into a consent agreement with Madison County Code Enforcement/Dog Control that such dog will be given humane care and adequate and necessary veterinary care, the owner may request, in writing, a hearing within five business days of the date the notice of impoundment was served on such owner, or, if the owner is unknown or could not be found, within 30 days of the date of publication of the notice of impoundment. If no hearing is requested within the time limits specified in this paragraph and the failure to request such hearing is due in whole or in part of the reasonably avoidable fault of the owner, the right to a hearing shall have been waived.

                  (g)  If the dog probate court finds by preponderance of the evidence that the dog was improperly impounded, the dog shall be returned to the lawful owner and the care and maintenance of the dog while impounded shall be paid by the Madison County Code Enforcement/Dog Control.

                  (a)  It shall be the duty of the dog control officer to notify the owner, if known or reasonably ascertainable, of every dog impounded, by telephone or by mail, as quickly as possible after the impoundment. The owner of any impounded dog may claim and take custody of the dog within three days of such impoundment and by paying an impoundment fee of $25.00 plus payment of a daily boarding fee of $10.00 for each day of impoundment, and the cost of a rabies inoculation if the dog does not display a current rabies tag or if the owner cannot provide proof of rabies inoculation. 
                  (b)  If the owner reclaiming the dog pursuant to item (a) above presents proof, either at the time of reclamation or within three days of reclamation, that the dog has been spayed or neutered, the impoundment and boarding fees referenced in item (a) shall be waived or refunded, up to a maximum of $35.00.

The disposal of any dog or cat as provided herein does not relieve the owner of any liability for any violation of this chapter. If the owner of the dog or cat is known or reasonably ascertainable, but for any valid reason cannot be reached within the prescribed period, the dog control officer shall be authorized to hold the dog or cat until such a time as the owner can be reached.

                  (e)  Unsafe buildings or systems. All buildings, structures, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing systems which are unsafe, unsanitary, or do not provide adequate egress, or which constitute a fire hazard, or are otherwise dangerous to human life, or which in relation to existing use, constitute a hazard to safety or health, are considered unsafe buildings or service systems.

The provisions of the construction codes are not intended to prevent the use of any material or method of construction not specifically prescribed by them, provided any such alternate has been reviewed by the building inspector. The building inspector shall approve any such alternate, provided the building inspector finds that the alternate for the purpose intended is at least the equivalent of that prescribed in the construction codes, in quality, strength, effectiveness, fire resistance, durability and safety. The building inspector shall require that sufficient evidence or proof be submitted to substantiate any claim made regarding the alternate.

                  (1)  Decision of the building inspector. The owner of a building, structure or service system, or his duly authorized agent, may appeal a decision of the building inspector to the construction board of adjustment and appeals whenever any one of the following conditions are claimed to exist: 
                  a.  The building inspector rejected or refused to approve the mode or manner of construction proposed to be followed or materials to be used in the installation or alteration of a building, structure or service system. 
                  b.  The provisions of the construction codes do not apply to this specific case.

                  (2)  Variances.

The construction board of adjustments and appeals, when so appealed to and after a hearing, may vary the application of any provision of the construction codes to any particular case when, in its opinion, the enforcement thereof would do manifest injustice and would be contrary to the spirit and purpose of this or the construction codes or public interest, and also finds that: 
                  1.  Special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the building, structure or service system involved and which are not applicable to others. 
                  2.  The special conditions and circumstances do not result from the action or inaction of the applicant. 
                  3.  Granting the variance requested will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by the construction codes to other buildings, structures or service system. 
                  4.  The variance granted is the minimum variance that will made possible the reasonable use of the building, structure or service system. 
                  5.  The grant of the variance will be in harmony with the general intent and purpose of the construction codes and will not be detrimental to the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  b.  Condition of variances. In granting the variance, the board may prescribe a reasonable time limit within which the action for which the variance is required shall be commenced or completed or both. In addition, the board may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with the construction codes. Violation of the conditions of a variance shall be deemed a violation of the construction codes. 
                  (3)  Notice of appeal. Notice of appeal shall be in writing and filed within 30 calendar days after the building inspector renders the decision. Appeals shall be in a form acceptable to the building inspector. 
                  (4)  Unsafe or dangerous buildings or service systems. In the case of a building, structure, or service system, which, in the opinion of the building inspector, is unsafe, unsanitary or dangerous, the building inspector may, in his order, limit the time for such notice of appeals to a shorter period. 
                  (f)  Rules and regulations. The board shall establish rules and regulations for its own procedure not inconsistent with the provisions of these procedures. The board shall meet on call of the chairman. The board shall meet within 30 calendar days after notice of appeal has been received. 
                  (g)  Decisions. The construction board of adjustment and appeals shall, in every case, reach a decision without unreasonable or unnecessary delay. Each decision of the board shall also include the reasons for the decision. If a decision of the board reverses or modifies a refusal, order, or disallowance of the building inspector or varies the application of any provision of the construction codes, the building inspector shall immediately take action in accordance with such decision.

                  (1)  No license which has been issued or which may be issued pursuant to this article shall be suspended or revoked except for due cause and after hearing and upon prior three-day written notice to the holder of the license of the time, place and purpose of the hearing and a statement of the charges upon which the hearing shall be held. 
                  (2)  The term "due cause" for the purposes of this section shall include, but not be limited to: 
                  a.  Conviction of, or the entering of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere by, the licensee or any of his employees or any person holding an interest in the license for any felony, any law, administrative regulation or ordinance involving alcoholic beverages, gambling or narcotics, or tax laws. 
                  b.  Suspension or revocation of any state license required as a condition for the possession, sale or distribution of alcoholic beverages. 
                  c.  Material falsification of any fact given in an application for a license issued under this chapter or bearing upon the licensee's qualification therefor. Any act which may be construed as a subterfuge in an effort to circumvent any of the qualifications for a license under this chapter shall be deemed a violation of the requirement attempted to be circumvented. 
                  d.  Failure to meet or maintain any standard prescribed by this article as a condition or qualification for holding a license. 
                  e.  Any other factor known to or discovered by the county whereby it is objectively shown the licensee, any of the licensee's employees or any person holding an interest in a license, has engaged in conduct at or involving the licensed business or has permitted conduct on the licensed premises that constitutes a violation of federal or state law, local ordinance or administrative regulations involving alcoholic beverages, gambling or narcotics for all alcohol licensed businesses. With respect to this section, it shall be rebuttably presumed that the violative act was done with the knowledge or consent of the licensee; provided, however, that such presumption may be rebutted only by evidence which precludes every other reasonable hypothesis save that such licensee did not know, assist or aid in such occurrence, or in the exercise of full diligence that such licensee could not have discovered or prevented such activity. 
                  (3)  Notice of suspension or revocation proceedings shall be served on the person named as manager-agent or other representative of the licensee in the application. Notice shall be in writing. The notice may be served personally or by first class mail. If by mail, the notice shall be addressed to the licensee at its address as provided by the licensee to the county. The burden shall be on the licensee to provide notice, in writing, of any change of address for service of notices and process. In the case of service by mail of any notice required by this chapter, the service is complete at the time of deposit in the United States Postal Service. 
                  (4)  The hearing shall be conducted by a hearing officer appointed by the chairman of the board of commissioners. The hearing officer shall be an attorney licensed to practice in the state who is disinterested in the proceeding. 
                  (5)  Hearings shall be only as formal as necessary to preserve order and shall be compatible with the principles of justice. The county attorney shall present the county's case and bear the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that due cause exists to suspend or revoke the license. At the hearing the licensee shall have the right to be represented by counsel, may cross examine all witnesses offered by the county, and may call witnesses and present evidence in its own behalf. Formal rules of evidence shall not apply to hearings under this section, although the hearing officer shall have the right to exclude evidence which carries no indicia of reliability. All testimony shall be offered under oath or affirmation. 
                  (6)  The hearing officer shall make his final determination within ten business days of the completion of the hearing. The decision shall be placed in writing and contain the hearing officer's findings of fact, conclusions of law, and decision as to sanction, if any. Such sanction may include one or more of the following: revocation of the license, suspension of the license for no more than 12 months, imposition of a probationary period not to exceed 12 months, and/or a civil monetary penalty not to exceed the amount allowed under the County Charter. Where the remaining term of the license is less than 12 months, imposition of suspension or probation for a period in excess of the term of the existing license shall be applied to any renewal license. A subsequent violation within a probationary period shall be cause for revocation and/or denial of license renewal. A total of three separate and unrelated violations within 24 months, whether or not within a probationary period, shall be grounds for permanent revocation. 
                  (7)  The hearing officer's decision shall be personally served or mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested to the licensee and its attorney, with a copy to the county attorney, within ten business days of the close of the hearing. The decision of the hearing officer shall constitute final action by the county, subject to review upon petition for certiorari to the superior court. 
                  (8)  Upon receipt of notice of adverse action against the licensee under this section, the licensee may waive its right to a hearing and stipulate to a sanction, as recommended by the chairman of the board of commissioners. Any stipulation entered under this subsection shall be in writing, signed by the licensee, and non-appealable.

                  (a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land disturbing activities. Therefore, plans for those land disturbing activities which are not excluded by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion and sedimentation control plans. These provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion and sedimentation control plans. Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of this section. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion and sedimentation pollution during all stages of any land disturbing activity. 
                  (b)  Minimum requirements/bmp's. 
                  (1)  Best management practices as set forth in subsections (b) and (c) of this section shall be required for all land disturbing activities. Proper design, installation and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with subsection (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act." As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed to control soil erosion and sedimentation for all rainfall events up to and including a 25-year, 24-hour rainfall event. 
                  (2)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or by the division or of any general permit for construction activities issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or by the division or of any general permit for construction activities issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
                  (c)  Additional requirements. The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to this article for the purpose of governing land disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the state soil and water conservation commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)  Cut and fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type, so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  (7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control measures shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in runoff water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping surface of fills; 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts, except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)  Land disturbing activity plans for erosion and sedimentation control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection (b) of this section; 
                  (15)  Except as provided in subsection (16) of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from this point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, or where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; provided, however, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of article 5, chapter 5 of title 12, of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated (O.C.G.A. § 12-5-440 et seq.), the "Metropolitan River Protection Act," shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer, and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  (16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to article 2 of chapter 5 of title 12 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated (O.C.G.A. § 12-5-20 et seq.), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board providing for notice to the division or local issuing authority of location and extent of the piping and prescribed methodology for minimizing the impact of such piping and for measuring the volume for water discharged by the stream. Any such pipe must stop short of the downstream landowner's property, and the landowner must comply with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and the specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the streambed; and 
                  (17)  Construction site operators must control waste such as discarded building materials, concrete truck washout, chemicals, litter, and sanitary waste at the construction site that may cause adverse impacts to water quality. 
                  (d)  Regulations exceeding minimum requirements. Nothing contained in this article shall prevent an issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. 
                  (e)  Injury to the property of another. The fact that land disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit.

                  Sec. 26-171. - Purpose and intent. 
                  The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-development stormwater runoff and nonpoint source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment. It has been determined that proper management of post-development stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety, environment and general welfare of the public, and protect water and aquatic resources. This article seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives: 
                  (1)  Establish decision-making processes surrounding land development activities that protect the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources; 
                  (2)  Require that new development and redevelopment maintain the pre-development hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as practicable in order to reduce flooding, streambank erosion, nonpoint source pollution and increases in stream temperature, and maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats; 
                  (3)  Establish minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality; 
                  (4)  Establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater control facilities that can be used to meet the minimum post-development stormwater management standards; 
                  (5)  Encourage the use of nonstructural stormwater management and stormwater better site design practices, such as the preservation of greenspace and other conservation areas, to the maximum extent practicable. Coordinate site design plans, which include greenspace, with the county's greenspace protection plan; 
                  (6)  Establish provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of structural stormwater control facilities and nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained, and pose no threat to public safety; and, 
                  (7)  Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans, and for the inspection of approved active projects, and long-term follow up.

                  All structural stormwater management facilities shall be selected and designed using the appropriate criteria from the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. All structural stormwater controls must be designed appropriately to meet their intended function. For other structural stormwater controls not included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual, or for which pollutant removal rates have not been provided, the effectiveness and pollutant removal of the structural control must be documented through prior studies, literature reviews, or other means and receive approval from the Madison County Planning and Zoning Department before being included in the design of a stormwater management system. In addition, if hydrologic or topographic conditions, or land use activities warrant greater control than that provided by the minimum control requirements, the Madison County Planning and Zoning Department may impose additional requirements deemed necessary to protect upstream and downstream properties and aquatic resources from damage due to increased volume, frequency, and rate of stormwater runoff or increased nonpoint source pollution loads created on the site in question. 
                  Applicants shall consult the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual for guidance on the factors that determine site design feasibility when selecting and locating a structural stormwater control.

                  (1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; and 
                  (4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; 
                  (5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.

                  (1)  To protect human life and health; 
                  (2)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
                  (3)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas, 
                  (4)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
                  (5)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
                  (6)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; and 
                  (7)  To insure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

                  Specifically, the following information is required: 
                  (1)  Application stage. 
                  a.  Elevation in relation to mean sea level (or highest adjacent grade) of the lowest floor, including basement, of all proposed structures; 
                  b.  Elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any non-residential structure will be floodproofed; 
                  c.  Design certification from a registered professional engineer or architect that any proposed non-residential floodproofed structure will meet the floodproofing criteria of division 4, subsection 30-72(2); 
                  d.  Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of a proposed development; and 
                  (2)  Construction stage. For all new construction and substantial improvements, the permit holder shall provide to the administrator an as-built certification of the regulatory floor elevation or floodproofing level immediately after the lowest floor or floodproofing is completed. Any lowest floor certification made relative to mean sea level shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a registered land surveyor or professional engineer and certified by same. When floodproofing is utilized for non-residential structures, said certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a professional engineer or architect and certified by same. 
                  Any work undertaken prior to submission of these certifications shall be at the permit holder's risk. 
                  The zoning administrator shall review the above referenced certification data submitted. Deficiencies detected by such review shall be corrected by the permit holder immediately and prior to further progressive work being allowed to proceed. Failure to submit certification or failure to make said corrections required hereby, shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the project.

                  DIVISION 4. - PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

                  Sec. 30-71. - General standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard, the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure; 
                  (2)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage; 
                  (3)  New construction or substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
                  (4)  Elevated buildings. All new construction or substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully-enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater. 
                  a.  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
                  1.  Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
                  2.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and 
                  3.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both direction. 
                  b.  So as not to violate the "lowest floor" criteria of this article, the unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area, and 
                  c.  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms. 
                  (5)  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
                  (6)  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces. 
                  (7)  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system; 
                  (8)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters; 
                  (9)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding; and 
                  (10)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure, which is not compliant with the provisions of this article, shall be undertaken only if the non-conformity is not furthered, extended or replaced.

                  Sec. 30-72. - Specific standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard, the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and/or substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and/or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 30-71(4), "elevated buildings". 
                  a.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  (2)  Non-residential construction. New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH zones, may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in subsection 30-63(6). 
                  (3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available. 
                  a.  All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on: (1) individual lots or parcels, (2) in new and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, (3) in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or (4) on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  b.  Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
                  1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation, or 
                  2.  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
                  c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (Ref. subsection 30-71(6) above) 
                  d.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
                  1.  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days. 
                  2.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick-disconnect-type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions), or 
                  3.  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "new construction", including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsections 30-72(3)a—c., above. 
                  (4)  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 30-42, are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted, however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
                  b.  Only if subsection 30-72(4)a. above is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of division 4.

                  Sec. 30-73. - Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodway (A-zones). 
                  Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 30-42, where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A-zones), or where base flood data have been provided, but a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 30-42, then the zoning administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of division 4. Only if data are not available from these sources, then the following provisions (2) and (3) shall apply: 
                  (2)  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 20 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in more than a one foot increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
                  (3)  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. (NOTE: Require the lowest floor to be elevated one foot above the estimated base flood elevation in A-zone areas where a limited detail study has been completed). Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 30-71(4) "elevated buildings". 
                  a.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. 
                  The zoning administrator shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file.

                  Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 30-42 where streams with base flood elevations are provided but no floodways have been designated, (zones AE) the following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  No encroachments, including fill material, new structures or substantial improvements shall be located within areas of special flood hazard, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community. The engineering certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles. 
                  (2)  New construction or substantial improvements of buildings shall be elevated or floodproofed to elevations established in accordance with section 30-72. 
                  (Ord. of 7-5-2010, art. 4, § D) 
                  Sec. 30-75. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO zones). 
                  Areas of special flood hazard established in section 30-42 may include designated "AO" shallow flooding areas. These areas have base flood depths of one to three feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. The following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and non-residential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 30-71(4), "elevated buildings". 
                  The zoning administrator shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
                  (2)  New construction or the substantial improvement of a non-residential structure may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to the specified FIRM flood level plus one foot, above highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and as required in subsections 30-62(1)c. and (2). 
                  (3)  Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure.

                  Sec. 30-91. - [Requests for appeals or variances.] 
                  (a)  The Madison County Planning Commission, as established by Madison County, shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this article. 
                  (b)  The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the zoning administrator in the enforcement or administration of this article. 
                  (c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the zoning administrator may appeal such decision to the Superior Court of Madison County, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1. 
                  (d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (g)  In reviewing such requests, the Madison County Planning Commission shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article. 
                  (h)  Conditions for variances. 
                  (1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
                  b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  (2)  The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (4)  The zoning administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (i)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the Madison County Planning Commission may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

                  Accessory structure means a structure having minimal value and used for parking, storage and other non-habitable uses, such as garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, hay sheds and the like. 
                  Addition (to an existing building) means any walled and roofed expansion to the perimeter of a building in which the addition is connected by a common load-bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition, which is connected by a firewall or is separated by an independent perimeter load-bearing wall, shall be considered "new construction". 
                  Appeal means a request for a review of the zoning administrator's interpretation of any provision of this article. 
                  Area of shallow flooding means a designated AO or AH zone on a community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to three feet, and/or where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. 
                  Area of special flood hazard means the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one-percent-or-greater chance of flooding in any given year. In the absence of official designation by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, areas of special flood hazard shall be those designated by the local community and referenced in section 30-42. 
                  Base flood means the flood having a one-percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
                  Base flood elevation (BFE) means the elevation shown on the flood insurance rate map for zones AE, AH, A1-A30, AR, AR/A, AR/AE, AR/A1-A30, AR/AH, AR/AO, V1-V30, and VE that indicates the water surface elevation resulting from a flood that has a one-percent chance of equaling or exceeding that level in any given year. 
                  Basement means that portion of a building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides. 
                  Building means any structure built for support, shelter, or enclosure for any occupancy or storage. 
                  Critical facility means any public or private facility, which, if flooded, would create an added dimension to the disaster or would increase the hazard to life and health. Critical facilities include:

NOTE: The market value of the structure should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
                  For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include (1) those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project, or (2) any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure". 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions means where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this article, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article. 
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

Such notice shall include a statement of the substance of the proposed rule or the rule to be repealed, and the time, the place, and the manner in which interested persons may present their views thereon. The notice of the hearing shall be given to: 
                  1.  Affected parties, except when the parties are so numerous as to make individual notices impracticable; notice then shall be given by publication in one or more newspapers calculated to afford actual notice to affected parties; 
                  2.  The secretary of any association, corporation or organization having a membership likely to be affected by the intended action;

                  If the board finds that an imminent threat to the public health requires adoption of a rule upon fewer than seven calendar days notice of hearing and states in writing reasons for that finding, the board may proceed with an emergency notice of hearing and with an immediate hearing. After the hearing the board may take such action as it deems necessary relative to the adoption of the emergency rule, stating in writing the reasons for the particular action taken.

All persons shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to be heard, but the hearing officer may impose reasonable guidelines for the orderly conduct of the hearing when necessary due to time limitations, number of persons wishing to speak, and other factors. 
                  c.  Record of hearing. The board shall provide secretarial services at hearings to record data, pertinent views, and argument presented, or, in place of this, a recording device to record all orally submitted data, views, and arguments.

The hearing officer shall also furnish upon request a copy of this report to any party affected by the rule, amendment, or repeal. 
                  b.  Adoption of the rule. After the hearing and review as set forth above, the board in a regular or special called session shall consider the report submitted by the hearing officer and take such action as it deems appropriate. Upon majority vote favoring the adoption of the proposed rule, amendment or repeal, the secretary of the board shall insert or shall have inserted in the appropriate place on the record:

                  c.  Permanent record of rules. The chairperson and the secretary of the board shall sign the rule, amendment, or repeal and the board's secretary shall assure its placement in a book maintained for the purpose of keeping an orderly, properly indexed copy of each rule. This book shall be available for reasonable inspection by any person during regular business hours.

                  (3)  Without provocation, uses to or of another person in such other person's presence, opprobrious or abusive words which by their very utterance tend to incite to an immediate breach of the peace, that is to say, words which as a matter of common knowledge and under ordinary circumstances will, when used to or of another person in such other person's presence, naturally tend to provoke violent resentment, that is, words commonly called "fighting words"; or 
                  (4)  Without provocation, uses obscene and vulgar or profane language in the presence of or by telephone to a person under the age of 14 years which threatens an immediate breach of the peace.

For purposes of this subsection, the term "proper identification" means any document issued by a governmental agency containing a description of the person, such person's photograph, or both, and giving such person's date of birth and includes, without being limited to, a passport, military identification card, driver's license, or an identification card authorized under O.C.G.A. §§ 40-5-100 through 40-5-104. "Proper identification" shall not include a birth certificate and shall not include any traffic citation and complaint form. 
                  (e)  If such conduct is not otherwise prohibited pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 3-3-24, nothing contained in this Code section shall be construed to prohibit any person under 21 years of age from:

                  (h)  Any retailer or retail consumption dealer, or any person acting on behalf of such retailer or retail consumption dealer, who upon requesting proper identification from a person attempting to purchase alcoholic beverages from such retailer or retail consumption dealer pursuant to subsection (h) of this Code section is tendered a driver's license which indicates that such driver's license is falsified, is not the driver's license of the person presenting it, or that such person is under the age of 21 years, the person to whom said license is tendered shall be authorized to either write down the name, address, and license number or to seize and retain such driver's license and in either event shall immediately thereafter summon a law enforcement officer who shall be authorized to seize the license either at the scene or at such time as the license can be located.

                  Sec. 46-37. - Duties and powers of the recreation board. 
                  (a)  The recreation board shall be first and foremost a recommending body, in place to assist the Madison County Board of Commissioners and the recreation director in the smooth and effective operation of a countywide recreation program for the citizens of Madison County. The recreation board shall be accountable to the Madison County Board of Commissioners. The recreation board shall: 
                  (1)  Consult with and make recommendations to the Madison County Board of Commissioners and the recreation director regarding the establishment and conduct of recreational programs and activities. 
                  (2)  Promote recreational activities that are wholesome and constructive for all the citizens of Madison County. 
                  (3)  Participate in local, state, and national recreational affairs.

                  (8)  Recommend short and long term goals of the recreation program. 
                  (9)  Communicate with the public on matters of concern regarding recreation department programming, and relay those concerns with recommendations to the director and/or board of commissioners, as appropriate. 
                  (b)  The recreation department head, referred to herein as the recreation director, retains and bears ultimate power and responsibility over the operation of the recreation department. Final decision on all recreation department matters rests with the director, except as to those matters on which decision-making authority is vested in the board of commissioners, or chairman thereof, by state law, local legislation, or county policy. The director should seek input and recommendation from the recreation board on those matters on which decision-making authority is vested in the board of commissioners or chairman by state law, local legislation, or county policy. The director should seek input and recommendation from the recreation board on those issues, and the recreation board should promptly and cooperatively provide input to the director on those matters, but the recreation director retains final authority over these matters. 
                  (c)  The powers of the recreation board are limited to those stated in these bylaws. By way of clarification and example, but not limitation, the following specific areas over which the recreation board has no authority are noted: 
                  (1)  The recreation board shall not own, possess, or handle funds or property. Persons wishing to make gifts, devises, or bequests of funds or property for recreational purposes shall be referred to the county finance officer. 
                  (2)  The recreation board exercises no authority in the area of employee practices. All personnel decisions, including hiring, termination, and discipline, are vested in the department head, chairman of the board of commissioners, and/or board of commissioners, as set forth in the county personnel policy. 
                  (3)  Direct communication on recreation department issues between members of the recreation board and employees within the recreation department is discouraged. The recreation board should rather serve as a liaison between the recreation director, the board of commissioners, and the citizenry. 
                  (4)  All purchasing, financial, and contract decisions are vested in the board of commissioners, except as the board of commissioners may have lawfully vested in department heads or other county employees pursuant to county policy. The board of commissioners may if it so desires seek input or recommendations from the recreation board on any such decisions.

                  (b)  Employees covered. 
                  (1)  Except as noted otherwise in this subsection 50-31(b), this policy applies to all employees of Madison County holding classified positions, as defined in section 50-32 hereof. 
                  (2)  This policy does not apply to the following persons and positions: 
                  a.  Any elected position, including a person appointed to fill an expired term. 
                  b.  Any position of employment by an elected official, unless said official has adopted this policy, in writing, and the board of commissioners has agreed to accept such position of employment under this policy, as provided by O.C.G.A. § 36-1-21. 
                  c.  Membership positions on appointed boards, committees, and commissions. 
                  (c)  No property rights in employment. All employees under the jurisdiction of the board of commissioners are "at will" employees, have no property interest in or expectation of continued employment, and have no rights to "due process" in connection with discipline or termination. As "at will" employees, such persons may be subjected to disciplinary action in the sole discretion of the chairman of the board of commissioners, who is hereby vested with authority over such matters. 
                  (d)  Reservation of powers of amendment. The board of commissioners reserves the right in its sole and absolute discretion in the public interest to amend these policies. Any such amendment may, without limitation, reorganize, abolish, consolidate, or create departments or exempt departments, positions, or categories of positions from coverage of these policies, change positions from classified to unclassified positions, alter salary or benefits for services rendered after the date of such amendment, or abolish the system of personnel administration provided by these policies. Any such amendment shall apply to any then-current or future employee of the county and the service of such then-current or future employee after the date of the amendment, including all rights of compensation for services rendered after such amendment and tenure shall be governed by the amendment. 
                  (Ord. of 1-9-2012(3), pt. I,(§ 1)) 
                  Sec. 50-32. - Definitions. 
                  For the purpose of this policy, the following terms shall have the meanings respectively ascribed to them below, unless another meaning is specifically indicated. 
                  Classified position means a position of employment for which the compensation is specified by the pay plan. 
                  Continuous service means employment that is uninterrupted except for authorized leaves of absence, suspension or separation due to a reduction in work force. 
                  Department head means the position with overall administrative responsibility for a department. 
                  Elected official means the sheriff, tax commissioner, probate judge, magistrate judge, clerk of superior court, coroner, and county surveyor. 
                  Paid leave includes both annual (vacation) leave and sick leave. 
                  Pay plan means the schedule of employment positions and corresponding rate of compensation for each, adopted by the board of commissioners and as may be amended by the board of commissioners. 
                  (Ord. of 1-9-2012(3), pt. I,(§ 2)) 
                  Sec. 50-33. - Pay plan. 
                  (a)  Establishment. The board of commissioners shall adopt a pay plan for positions of employment under the jurisdiction of the board of commissioners. The board of commissioners may choose to omit positions from the pay plan (e.g., positions it chooses to fill by individual contracts of employment). By definition, positions omitted from the pay plan are not subject to this policy, unless and to the extent the board of commissioners specifies application of this policy to such position in the contract or other arrangement with the person so employed. 
                  (b)  Amendment. The board of commissioners, in its sole discretion, may amend the pay plan at any time and in any manner, including, but not limited to, creating positions, abolishing positions, altering the job descriptions for positions, and raising or lowering the rates of pay for positions. 
                  (Ord. of 1-9-2012(3), pt. I,(§ 3)) 
                  Sec. 50-34. - Recruitment and selection for vacant positions. 
                  (a)  Recruitment. 
                  (1)  Department heads shall be responsible for notifying the human resources manager of vacant, or soon to be vacant, positions in their departments. The department head and human resources manager shall confer at the earliest opportunity to determine whether recruitment should be limited to current county employees or open to the public; how postings, advertisements, and notices should be made; and whether a closing date for applications should be specified. 
                  (2)  If the human resources manager and department head wish, and the board of commissioners chair consents, a position may be filled from review of applications previously submitted, without the necessity of new postings or advertisements. It is anticipated this process would typically be used in situations where an applicant is hired and then resigns after only a short time. 
                  (b)  The human resources manager may design application forms, and may require their use in connection with any particular vacancy. 
                  (c)  The department head and human resources manager shall review applications and resumes, conduct interviews, and/or take such other review as they deem appropriate, and recommend one or more candidates to the board of commissioners chair for approval. For department head positions, the chair shall make the selection, with such assistance from the human resources manager as he directs. In all cases, the final hiring authority rests with the chair. 
                  (Ord. of 1-9-2012(3), pt. I,(§ 4)) 
                  Sec. 50-35. - Outside employment, financial interest. 
                  (a)  Outside employment. Employees shall not engage in any other employment or in any private business or profession during the hours for which they are employed and scheduled to work for the county, nor outside of such hours in a manner or to an extent that affects or is deemed likely to affect the employee's performance. 
                  (b)  Financial interest. Employees shall not knowingly have a financial interest in the profits of any contract, service or other work performed by the government. Nor shall employees profit directly or indirectly from any contract, purchase sale and/or service between the county and any person or company. 
                  (Ord. of 1-9-2012(3), pt. I,(§ 5)) 
                  Sec. 50-36. - Gifts and gratuities. 
                  An employee shall not accept gifts, gratuities, or loans from organizations, business concerns, or individuals with which he/she has official business. These limitations do not prohibit the acceptance of articles of negligible value, which are distributed generally, nor do they prohibit employees from obtaining loans from regular lending institutions. 
                  (Ord. of 1-9-2012(3), pt. I,(§ 6)) 
                  Sec. 50-37. - Political activity. 
                  Employees shall not make use of county time or equipment to aid a political candidate, political party, or political cause. 
                  (Ord. of 1-9-2012(3), pt. I,(§ 7)) 
                  Sec. 50-38. - Supervisory authority; references. 
                  (a)  Scope of authority. Supervisory employees should exercise such authority and discretion as set out in the employee's job description. If a supervisory employee has doubt as to his or her authority to make a decision or take an action, he or she should consult his or her own supervisor for direction. Department heads should consult the chairman of the board of commissioners for direction on questions as to their own scope of authority, and on such inquiries from subordinates when they are unsure as to the proper answer. 
                  (b)  Reference inquiries. All inquiries regarding current or former employees will be responded to by the human resources manager. Any employee who receives such an inquiry shall not give out any information concerning such current or former employee, but rather shall refer the inquirer to the human resources manager. 
                  (Ord. of 1-9-2012(3), pt. I,(§ 8)) 
                  Sec. 50-39. - Reinstatement and transfers. 
                  (a)  Reinstatement. If a previous employee is rehired by the county within 12 months, he/she will be given credit for prior time of service for purposes of compensation, leave time, and all other purposes hereunder. 
                  (b)  Transfers. Employees transferring to another department will receive a pay rate adjustment to the entry level rate for that position. The employee will retain years of service for reasons of pension and vacation pay. Also, the employee will receive an equity code adjustment for years of service as applied to the new pay rate after three full pay periods in the new position. 
                  (Ord. of 1-9-2012(3), pt. I,(§ 9)) 
                  Sec. 50-40. - Compensation policy. 
                  (a)  Permanent full-time employment. Employment for a 40-hour workweek, expected to continue indefinitely. 
                  (b)  Permanent part-time employment. Employment for a workweek of less than 40 hours, expected to continue indefinitely. Part-time employees shall be entitled to insurance benefits on a pro-rated basis (e.g., county will pay 50 percent on the amount it pays for full-time employees if employed for 20 hours per week, 100 percent if employed for 30 hours per week, etc.), and shall accrue leave time on a pro-rated basis (e.g., 50 percent if employed for 20 hours per week, 75 percent if employed for 30 hours per week, etc.) 
                  (c)  Temporary employment. Employment on either a full-time or part-time basis indefinitely. Temporary employees shall not be entitled to insurance benefits or paid leave time. 
                  (d)  On call. Employment simply by being placed on an approved list of persons who may be called upon by a department head when additional personnel are needed due to absences, vacations, or other reasons. On-call employees shall not be entitled to insurance benefits or paid leave time. Placement on a call list is no guarantee of being called upon at all or of being called upon for any specific number of hours. 
                  (e)  Hours of work. The department head shall, in his or her discretion, establish the weekend hours of work for employees under his or her supervision, subject to the Fair Labor Standard Act and any other applicable law. For employees in offices located in the county government complex, work hours shall be consistent with the office hours established in the general county policy. 
                  (f)  Workers' compensation. Any employee who is accidentally injured on the job is covered under the Georgia Workers' Compensation Act. An employee may elect to receive his/her accumulated sick, or sick and annual leave in lieu of workers' compensation benefits while he/she is disabled. In the event the available leave is inadequate to cover the entire period of disability (in excess of the first seven days of disability) the employee would be entitled to weekly benefits as of the day his/her leave was exhausted. Alternatively, an employee may opt to receive only the workers' compensation benefits that are authorized by law, which most often will be monetarily less than an individual's normal salary. 
                  (g)  Return to work policy. Madison County participates in the Loss Control and Safety Incentive Program of the ACCG Group Self-Insurance Workers' Compensation Fund, through which workers' compensation coverage is provided to county employees. In accordance with the requirements of that program, department heads and elected officials are directed/encouraged to make efforts to return injured workers to employment as soon as reasonable and practicable. In situations where the employee's treating physician has determined that temporary physical limitations do not permit the employee's return to his previous job, such efforts should include providing "transitional employment" (i.e., temporary duties that are less strenuous than the employee's normal job duties) where reasonable and practicable. 
                  (h)  Overtime and compensatory time. 
                  (1)  Definitions. The county will comply with the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and applicable state laws governing minimum wages, overtime pay, and child labor. The county determines "exempt" or "non-exempt" of positions in accordance with FLSA guidelines. Questions regarding exempt/non-exempt status should be directed to the human resources manager. 
                  Exempt employees are not subject to the overtime pay provisions of the FLS(a) 
                  Non-exempt employees are subject to the wage and hour provisions. Under the FLSA, most non-exempt employees must be paid: 
                  a.  At least the federal minimum wage, and 
                  b.  FLSA overtime, which consists of time and one-half the employee's regular rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of 40 [hours] in a standard workweek (except as to fire protection and law enforcement personnel who have a work period of at least seven but fewer than 28 consecutive days, for whom overtime compensation is required when the ratio of the number of hours worked to the number of days in the work period exceeds a specified ratio as set forth in 29 U.S.(c)(a) § 207(k) and 29(c)(f)R. § 55(3)201(a)). Paid leave or holiday time used is not counted as hours worked in determining overtime. 
                  The payment of overtime to non-exempt employees is a legal requirement. Department heads may not tell non-exempt employees that they are ineligible for overtime pay, and any who make such statements may be subject to progressive counseling up to and including termination. 
                  (2)  Overtime/compensatory time. It is the county's intent to schedule work activities during the standard 40-hour workweek. However, in order to meet customer and business needs, it may be necessary for non-exempt employees to work in excess of those hours. When this is necessary, department heads will provide as much notice as possible to the employees required to work. 
                  Authorization to work in excess of the standard 40-hour workweek must be obtained in advance from the department head. Employees who work in excess of 40 hours in a standard workweek without prior authorization may be subject to progressive counseling up to and including termination of employment. 
                  (3)  Compensatory time maximums. Employees engaged in public safety or emergency response may not accrue more than 480 hours of compensatory time. Since compensatory time is accumulated at time and one-half, this is 320 hours of actual overtime work (320 hours of overtime work × 1.5 = 480 hours). All other non-exempt employees may not accrue more than 240 hours of compensatory time (160 hours of overtime work × 1.5 = 240 hours). If a non-exempt employee's compensatory time balance exceeds the accumulation limits of 240 or 480 hours, the employee must be paid for any hours over the limit at time and one-half the employee's regular rate of pay. 
                  (4)  Conditions of use of compensatory time. An employee of a public agency who has accrued compensatory time and requests use of this compensatory time shall be permitted to use such time off within a reasonable period after making the request, if such use does not unduly disrupt the operations of the county and department within which the employee works. What constitutes a "reasonable period" will be determined by considering the customary work practices within the department based on the facts and circumstances in each case. Such practices include, but are not limited to, (a) the normal schedule of work, (b) anticipated peak workloads based on past experience, (c) emergency requirements for staff and services, and (d) the availability of qualified substitute staff. 
                  (5)  Cash in lieu of compensatory time. 
                  a.  Overtime compensation due under the FLAS may be paid in cash at the county's option, in lieu of providing compensatory time off hereunder, in any workweek or work period. The FLSA does not prohibit an employer from freely substituting cash, in whole or part, for compensatory time off; and overtime payment in cash would not affect subsequent granting of compensatory time off in future workweeks or work periods. 
                  b.  Cash overtime compensation must be paid at a rate not less than one and one-half times the regular rate at which the employee is actually paid. 
                  (6)  Cash compensation at termination of employment. 
                  a.  Upon termination of employment, an employee shall be paid for unused compensatory time at a rate of compensation not less than: 
                  1.  The average regular rate received by such employee during the last three years of the employee's employment, or 
                  2.  The final regular rate received by such employee, whichever is higher. 
                  b.  The phrase "last three years of employment" means the three-year period immediately prior to termination. Where an employee's last three years of employment are not continuous because of a break in service, the period of employment after the break in service will be treated as new employment. However, such a break in service must have been intended to be permanent and any accrued compensatory time earned after April 14, 1986, must have been cashed out at the time of initial separation. Where the final period of employment is less than three years, the average rate still must be calculated based on the rate(s) in effect during such period. 
                  (i)  Call-ins. If an employee is called into work on a date he or she was not scheduled to work, the employee will be paid for the greater of: 
                  (1)  Actual time worked plus travel time from and return to the employee's home, or 
                  (2)  Two hours. 
                  (Ord. of 1-9-2012(3), pt. I,(§ 10); Res. of 1-6-2014(4) , § 1; Ord. of 2-6-2017(2) ) 
                  Sec. 50-41. - Employee performance evaluation. 
                  (a)  Objective. The purpose of the employee performance evaluation is to inform employees of how well they are performing their work and how they can improve their work performance. 
                  (b)  Evaluations. Evaluations shall be prepared by the immediate supervisor of each employee and reviewed by the department head. Evaluations should typically be given one time per year, but may be done more or less often, at the option of the department head. 
                  (c)  Review with employees. The immediate supervisor shall discuss each performance evaluation with the employee being evaluated. If an employee disagrees with a statement(s) in an evaluation, such employee may submit, within ten days following the conference with his or her immediate supervisor, a written statement, which shall be attached to the evaluation form and forwarded to the human resource manager. 
                  (Ord. of 1-9-2012(3), pt. I,(§ 11)) 
                  Sec. 50-42. - Separations. 
                  (a)  Resignation. An employee shall submit to the department head written notice of resignation at least 14 days in advance of the date of resignation. A resigning department head shall submit such written notice to the chairman of the board of commissioners. Resignations are deemed accepted upon submission. 
                  (b)  Abandonment of job. An employee not on authorized leave of absence who fails to report for work or three consecutive days may be deemed to have abandoned employment. An employee who abandons employment forfeits all accrued vacation time. 
                  (c)  Layoff or reduction in force. Any employee may be laid off because of shortage of funds or work, abolishment of the position, material changes in the duties or organization, or related reasons beyond the employer or the employee's control which do not reflect dissatisfaction to other employees holding positions appropriate classes shall be affected. 
                  (d)  Dismissals. Employees may be dismissed by the chairman of the board of commissioners at any time and in his/her sole discretion. 
                  (e)  Retirement. The retirement of an employee shall consist of the voluntary separation of an employee who has met the requirements of age and length of service under the laws governing any applicable retirement plan of which such employee is a member. 
                  (f)  Death. Separation shall be effective as of the date of the death of the employee. All compensation, including annual leave pay, due to such employee, as of the effective date of separation, shall be paid to the beneficiary of the employee, the surviving spouse of such employee, or to the estate of such employee, as may be determined by law or by the applicable executed documents in the personnel folder of such employee. 
                  (g)  Mandatory certification; reimbursement. Whenever an employee obtains a professional or trade certification at county expense, which certification is required as a condition of holding the employee's job position, no reimbursement shall be required from the employee if he or she remains in the employ of the county for two or more years after obtaining such certification. If the employee leaves the employ of the county within one year of obtaining such certification, the employee shall be liable to the county for reimbursement of 100 percent of all expenses incurred by the county for such certification, including, but not limited to, registration fees for training courses and certification examinations. If the employee leaves the employ of the county after one year but within two years of obtaining such certification, the employee shall be liable to the county for reimbursement of 50 percent of all expenses incurred by the county for such certification, including, but not limited to, registration fees for training courses and certification examinations. 
                  (Ord. of 1-9-2012(3), pt. I,(§ 12)) 
                  Sec. 50-43. - Disciplinary actions. 
                  (a)  Prohibited conduct. Disciplinary action may be warranted by improper conduct, including, but not limited to, the following: 
                  (1)  The conviction of a felony, or of a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude.

                  ARTICLE III. - DRUG AND ALCOHOL POLICY 

                  Sec. 50-71. - Rationale and employees covered. 
                  Madison County is committed to maintaining a work environment free from the adverse impact of employee drug and alcohol abuse. Employee drug and alcohol abuses create serious risks of physical harm to employees, persons who rely on Madison County's services, and to the public. It constitutes a direct threat to the lives and property of the citizens of Madison County and the public health, safety and welfare of all persons in Madison County. Drug and alcohol abuse leads to increased accident rates and absenteeism, causes job performance and efficiency to suffer, seriously compromises safety in the workplace and community, and discredits the county government's reputation; therefore, Madison County will not tolerate an employee's possession, sale, distribution, consumption or presence in the body of alcoholic beverages or illegal drugs while on county property or on county business at any time. In order to further the objective of protecting their persons and property of its employees, citizens and the general public, Madison County hereby adopts and implements the following policy. 
                  (Ord. of 1-9-2012(3), pt. II,(§ 1)) 
                  Sec. 50-72. - Drug and alcohol use prohibited. 
                  Substance and alcohol abuse by Madison County Employees during assigned working hours, in county building or on county grounds, or otherwise on county business is prohibited. This shall include the use of illegal substances, the abuse of prescription medications, and the use or abuse of alcohol. 
                  (1)  Illegal drugs. 
                  a.  Madison County prohibits employees from manufacturing, dispensing, using, consuming, possessing, distributing, purchasing or selling or otherwise transferring any illegal drug or controlled substance while on the job, on county property, operating county equipment or vehicles or operating any other equipment or vehicles on county business. "Illegal drug or controlled substance" means any drug or substance the law prohibits individuals from manufacturing, dispensing, using, consuming, possessing, distributing, purchasing or selling or otherwise transferring, including, without limitation, marijuana and cocaine, as well as drugs listed as controlled substances under the Controlled Substances Act, 21U.S.(c) 81(2) 
                  b.  Madison County prohibits employees from being on the job, on county property, operating county equipment or vehicles or operating any other equipment or vehicles on county business while impaired due to any illegal drug or controlled substance. An employee is impaired due to the influence of an illegal drug or controlled substance. An employee is impaired due to the influence of an illegal drug or controlled substance if drug test results indicate the presence of an illegal drug or controlled substance in the employee's system in an amount that constitutes a positive test result under accepted scientific standards. 
                  c.  Off-the-job illegal drug use or activity or arrest relating to such illegal drug use or activity is a violation of the policy. Off-the-job drug use or activity or arrest relating to such use or activity is likely to adversely affect the functioning of Madison County in many ways, including, without limitation, one or more of the following: adverse effects on job performance or attendance, jeopardizing the safety or welfare of the employee or fellow employees, jeopardizing the safety or welfare of persons which county services seek to protect, or risking damage to county or other property. An employee convicted for a violation of a criminal drug stature in the workplace or elsewhere or cited for a DUI, must notify the county no later than five days after such conviction. 
                  (2)  Legally obtained drugs. 
                  a.  Employees must not be on the job, on county property, operating county equipment or vehicles, or operating any other equipment or vehicles on county business while impaired due to any drug, legal or illegal, that renders the employee unfit for duty. An employee is "unfit for duty" if, in the county's opinion, the employee's use of legally obtained drugs jeopardizes the employee's ability to work safely or efficiently. An employee who is using legally obtained drugs must notify the employee's immediate supervisor of any and all symptoms that may render the employee unfit for duty. If an employee's medically-required use of legally obtained drugs renders the employee unfit for duty and, in the opinion of the county, a temporary alternative job assignment is not available, the employee will be considered as an employee unfit for duty due to illness. 
                  b.  Employees using prescription medication while on the job shall do so in strict accordance with medical directions. It is the employee's responsibility to notify the prescribing physician of the duties required by the employee's position and to insure the physician approves the use of the prescription medication while the employee is performing the employee's duties. 
                  c.  The abuse or inappropriate use of legally prescribed drugs during assigned work hours is prohibited. Job performance or attendance deficiencies resulting from abuse or inappropriate use shall be cause for disciplinary action. If an employee's behavior or job performance gives rise to a reasonable suspicion that the employee is abusing or inappropriately using prescription medication, the employee may be required to submit to drug testing and to take any accrued sick or annual leave or leave without pay until such time as the employee is cleared to return to work by the employee's physician and department head. 
                  (3)  Alcohol. 
                  a.  Madison County prohibits employees from using, consuming, possessing, distributing, purchasing, selling or otherwise transferring alcoholic beverages on the job, on county property, while operating county equipment or vehicles or operating any other equipment or vehicles on county business. 
                  b.  Madison County also prohibits employees from being at work or on county property or operating any other equipment or vehicles on county business under the influence of alcohol. An employee is under the influence of alcohol if, based on the employee's speech, statements, behavior, conduct, appearance or odor, the county believes the employee is under the influence of alcohol. An employee is also under the influence if test results indicate the employee's blood alcohol concentration level is .04 or higher. An employee is also under the influence of alcohol if he has been arrested for operating, under the influence of alcohol, county equipment or vehicles or any other equipment or vehicles or any other equipment or vehicles on county business. 
                  c.  Off-the-job uses of alcohol that the county reasonably believes adversely affect job performance or attendance, jeopardize the safety or welfare of the employee or fellow employees, jeopardize the safety, health or welfare of persons covered by the county's insurance programs or risks damage to county or other property are also a violation of this policy. 
                  d.  Penalty for violation of the policy. An employee who, in the opinion of the county, violates any provision of this section 50-72 of this policy is subject to discipline as set forth in the Madison County Personnel Policy, up to and including discharge. 
                  (Ord. of 1-9-2012(3), pt. II,(§ 2)) 
                  Sec. 50-73. - Pre-employment drug and alcohol testing. 
                  (a)  Drug screening. To further the goal of providing a drug-free workplace and protecting the health, safety and welfare of the employees, citizens, and general public of Madison County, all job applicants being considered for employment shall be required to pass a drug screening test prior to employment. As a part of the pre-employment physical, the test will be required after the interview process has verified the applicant has the necessary skills required to perform the job duties. All job applicants will be informed in advance that the test shall be required. A candidate for employment shall not be allowed to start working until the drug test results have been reviewed and approved by the MRO, as defined below. 
                  (b)  Positive test results. An applicant who has an initial screening positive test result for an illegal drug or controlled substance will not be hired and will not be reconsidered for any subsequent employment for a period of six months. 
                  (c)  Consent. An applicant who refuses to consent to the test will not be hired. 
                  (Ord. of 1-9-2012(3), pt. II,(§ 3)) 
                  Sec. 50-74. - Testing for employees. 
                  (a)  Requirement. To ensure the success of this drug and alcohol policy, the county will require employees to undergo urinalysis or other medical drug and alcohol detection procedures under the circumstances described below. All required medical tests, all procedures in connection therewith, the interpretation thereof and the determination of positive results will be conducted in accordance with the procedures for drug and alcohol testing set out in 49 CFR Part 40, which is incorporated herein by reference, at the county's expense, by qualified, county designated medical personnel under the direction of the person designated as the medical review officer, the "MRO". All job applicants and employees who are required to undergo testing must sign a consent form authorizing the medical personnel to conduct testing. 
                  (b)  Random testing. 
                  (1)  Certain positions are critical to the public welfare and the safety and health of fellow employees. Employees in safety and health sensitive positions or employees whose job duties require maintenance or operation of a motor vehicle or motorized equipment shall be required to submit to a drug and alcohol screening at unannounced times or on a periodic basis from time to time as determined by the county. The following positions are considered safety sensitive: the chairman and members of the board of commissioners; buildings and grounds custodian supervisor and maintenance supervisor; courthouse security; sheriff's department chief deputy, deputy sheriff's, investigators and lieutenants; jail cook, detention officers, jail administrator and nurse; D.A.R.E. officers; ambulance service director, assistant director, EMTs, paramedics, and supply manager; EMA director; E-911 director, assistant director and dispatchers; road department supervisor, assistant supervisor, drains and bridges technicians, heavy equipment operators, maintenance detail, mechanics, mowing crew and truck drivers; transfer station heavy equipment operators; senior center van drivers; recreation department maintenance coordinator, park maintenance supervisor and park maintenance technicians; building inspectors; code enforcement officer. 
                  (2)  Employees in safety and health sensitive positions or employees whose job duties require maintenance or operation of a motor vehicle or motorized equipment may expect to be tested on an unannounced basis. The chairman of the board of commissioners, subject to review by the board, is authorized to develop an unannounced and anonymous method of selecting employees for testing on a periodic basis. In each unannounced selection, the names of all employees subject to testing shall be included for each draw of names to be tested. The chairman shall determine a percentage of employees to be tested each time that is deemed both cost effective and sufficient to insure that the goals of the policy are implemented. The chairman may direct the testing of any or all of the employees subject to testing on an occasional or periodic basis. 
                  (3)  The board of commissioners may designate additional positions which are deemed to be safety sensitive and subject to testing on an unannounced or periodic basis. 
                  (4)  Employees selected for random testing shall not be notified of the test until it is time to proceed to the collection site, and shall proceed to the collection site as quickly as possible upon notification and, in any event, no later than 4:30 p.m. If a selected employee is off duty or otherwise unavailable at the time the employer desires to conduct the test, the test will be rescheduled. 
                  (5)  It is understood that firefighters and rescue personnel are volunteers and contribute their time unselfishly for the protection of the citizens of the county. The county recognizes that volunteer firefighters, first responders, and rescue personnel ordinarily hold full-time employment elsewhere. In order to avoid disrupting their employment, volunteers shall be given a reasonable period of time in which to report for such testing, but not less than 24 hours. 
                  (c)  Reasonable suspicion testing. 
                  (1)  Testing will be required when a supervisor reasonably suspects an employee is impaired or unfit for duty due to illegal drugs, controlled substances, or alcohol. Testing based on a reasonable belief an employee is using or has used drugs or alcohol in violation of the policy may be drawn from specific objective and documented facts and reasonable inferences drawn from those facts and may be based upon, among other things: 
                  a.  Observable phenomena, such as direct observation of possession, transfer or use of such drugs, controlled substances, or alcohol, or the physical symptoms of being impaired or unfit for duty due to any of same; 
                  b.  Abnormal conduct or erratic behavior while at work including, but not limited to: slurred speech, staggered gait, flushed face, dilated or pinpoint pupils, deterioration of work performance including absenteeism and tardiness; or a report of alcohol or drug use during assigned working hours provided by reliable and credible sources and independently corroborated. 
                  (2)  Each employee is subject to, but not entitled to, drug or alcohol testing whenever the county reasonably suspects the employee uses illegal drugs or controlled substances, abuses legally obtained drugs, or abuses alcohol. 
                  (3)  An employee who is tested pursuant to section 50-74(c) will be suspended pending the test outcome. If the test is negative, the employee will be allowed to return to work with full back pay, unless the suspension was imposed for additional reasons unrelated to this policy. 
                  (d)  Post-accident testing. All employees involved in a work-related incident which requires medical attention, involves personal injury, or involves property damage may be tested promptly for drug and alcohol use in accordance with county policies, at the discretion of the department head. Any employee involved in a motor vehicle accident while driving a county vehicle on a public roadway shall be tested for drugs and alcohol. This section shall also apply to any employee involved in a motor vehicle accident while driving a private vehicle on county business. 
                  (e)  Test results will be kept confidential. All information from an employee's or job applicant's drug and alcohol test shall be confidential and only available to the department head, board of commissioners and their legal counsel, the medical review officer, those employees of Madison County who have valid need to know, and those involved in any appeal process should it become necessary. Disclosure of test results to any other person, agency, or organization shall be prohibited unless written authorization is obtained from the employee or job applicant. The results of a positive drug or alcohol test shall not be released until the results are confirmed. These confidentiality provisions are subject to and may be superseded by requirements of the Georgia Open Meetings Act, Georgia Open Records Act, and other state or federal laws or regulations, including, but not limited to, the requirement that evidence for disciplinary action by the board of commissioners be taken in open session. 
                  (f)  List of medications. If an applicant or employee tests positive for drugs or alcohol, Madison County will ask the individual to provide a list of those prescriptions and over-the-counter medications recently used. The list of medications shall be kept confidential. The list of medications shall be disclosed only to the medical review officer who will determine whether the positive result was due to the lawful use of any of the listed medications. 
                  (g)  Drugs for which employees will be tested. 
                  (1)  The drugs to be tested for include, but are not limited to, the following: 

                   
                  (2)  Any employee who undergoes any test for alcohol and the results indicate a blood alcohol concentration of 0.04 or more shall be considered to be in violation of this policy which shall subject the employee to all the terms and conditions of the policy. 
                  (h)  Consent. Before a test is administered, employees and job applicants will be asked to sign a consent form authorizing the test and permitting release of test results to the employer and the medical review officials. The consent form shall provide a space for employees and job applicants to acknowledge they have been notified of the requirements of this policy. 
                  (i)  Refusal to consent. 
                  (1)  Job applicants. Any applicant for a job with Madison County who refuses to consent to a drug test shall be denied employment. 
                  (2)  Employees. Any employee who refuses to sign the consent form or submit to a drug and alcohol test as required herein shall be subject to termination. Employees who fail to appear at the designated collection site to take the test when so directed shall also be subject to termination. 
                  (j)  Failure to cooperate. Any employee, who (1) fails to cooperate with a county investigation into possible violations of this policy or (2) refuses to sign the consent to or to take a drug or alcohol test; will be discharged.

                  Sec. 50-75. - Searches. 
                  When a supervisor reasonably suspects, as outlined in section 50-74 of the policy, that an employee is impaired or unfit for duty due to an illegal drug, controlled substance, or alcohol, or that an employee is manufacturing, dispensing, using, consuming, possessing, distributing, purchasing or selling or otherwise transferring any illegal drug, controlled substance or alcohol while on the job, on county property, operating county equipment or vehicles or operating any other equipment or vehicles on county business, the county shall have the right to conduct reasonable searches of the employee's clothing, briefcase, purse, lunch box, tool box, or motor vehicle. Prior to conducting a search pursuant to this section, the county will explain to the employee the reasons and grounds for the search and request the employee's consent to the search. Searches will be conducted in a manner that minimizes any intrusions into the employee's privacy. No search will be conducted if the employee refuses to consent to the search, but the employee's refusal to cooperate with search efforts may subject the employee to discipline up to and including discharge. If a search uncovers evidence of employee wrongdoing, illegal activity, or employee violations of county rules or policies, the evidence may be used to support disciplinary actions up to and including discharge. In cases involving suspected illegal activities, the evidence may be turned over to the proper legal authorities. 
                  (Ord. of 1-9-2012(3), pt. II,(§ 5)) 
                  Sec. 50-76. - Drivers of commercial motor vehicles. 
                  (a)  Applicability; conflict with federal law. The provisions of this drug and alcohol policy apply to all persons in the employ of Madison County, Georgia, who are required to have a commercial driver's license and who operate a commercial motor vehicle while performing duties for Madison County (hereafter "drivers"). This section 50-76 imposes certain additional policies and procedures on such drivers. The purpose of this section is to comply with 49 U.S.(c)(a) section 31306 and all regulations promulgated thereunder, and to the extent anything herein should be deemed to conflict with such statute or regulations, the statute and regulations shall control. 
                  (b)  Return-to-duty and follow-up testing. 
                  (1)  In addition to any other requirements hereunder, any driver who has engaged in conduct in violation of this policy concerning alcohol shall be required to undergo an alcohol test with a result of less than 0.02 prior to returning to duty. In addition to any other requirements hereunder, any driver who has engaged in conduct in violation of this policy concerning controlled substances shall undergo a controlled substance test with a result indicating a verified negative result for controlled substance use prior to returning to duty. 
                  (2)  In addition to any other requirements hereunder, following a determination that a driver is in need of assistance in resolving problems associated with alcohol misuse or use of controlled substances, the driver shall be subject to unannounced follow-up testing as directed by a substance abuse professional. Such testing shall be conducted only while, just before and just after the driver is performing safety-sensitive functions. 
                  (c)  Test results, record retention and confidentiality. 
                  (1)  Record retention. The county will maintain records in connection with this policy in accordance with the requirements of CFR § 38(2)40(1).

                  (4)  Medical review officer notifications to Madison County. The medical review officer, herein MRO, shall report to the county official designated by the board of commissioners the results of the MRO's review made pursuant to 49 CFR Part 40. The report shall be in writing, signed and received by the county within three business days of the completion of the review. The MRO shall notify the county if unable to contact the driver as set out in 49 CFR Part 40. The county shall immediately require the driver to contact the MRO and notify the MRO that the driver has been notified to contact the MRO. 
                  (5)  Record retention by the medical review officer. The MRO shall maintain all records, identified by individual, for five years for verified positive controlled substance tests and for one year for negative or canceled tests. Other than as allowed by law and this policy, the MRO shall not release the test results to any third person without the specific written authorization of the driver. 
                  (6)  County notifications. Any driver tested under this policy shall be notified by the county of the results of the tests conducted and, if positive for controlled substances, shall request the driver contact the MRO, if the driver has not already done so. 
                  (7)  Previous employers. It shall be a condition of employment that a driver applying for employment consent to the county obtaining information maintained by any previous employer under CFR § 38(2)401(b)(1)(i) through (iii). The county shall obtain and review such information prior to employing the driver. If the county obtains information showing a refusal to be tested, a verified positive controlled substance test or an alcohol test with a concentration of 0.04 or greater, the driver shall not be employed by the county. 
                  (d)  Testing procedures. All tests shall be performed in accordance with 49 CFR Part 40-Procedures for Transportation Workplace Drug Testing Programs. The controlled substances for which tested shall include only those approved by the U.S. Department of Transportation. The county will contract for the services of a medical review officer and a certified laboratory for controlled substance testing. The county will use county employees for alcohol testing. The county reserves the right to change any of these. Any contract for service will include a requirement for compliance with 49 CFR Part 40.

                  h.  Refusal to consent to a reasonable search pursuant to section 50-75 of the policy. 
                  (2)  Additional factors to be considered. Additional factors may be reviewed to determine disciplinary action for violations of this policy. These factors include, but are not limited to: 
                  a.  Public safety and law enforcement personnel shall be held to a higher standard; 
                  b.  Positions of leadership within the county shall be held to a higher standard;

                  (c)  Voluntary admissions. An employee with a drug or alcohol abuse problem may voluntarily report such to his or her department head, to the human resources manager, or to the chairman of the board of commissioners. For purposes of this section, a voluntary admission is one made by the employee prior to actual or constructive notice that he or she is, or may in the immediate future be, asked or required to undergo a random, post-accident, or reasonable suspicion drug and alcohol test. If an employee makes a voluntary admission of drug or alcohol abuse pursuant hereto, he or she may be transferred to another position of employment within the county under the following conditions: 
                  (1)  The position must be one not classified as safety sensitive under subsection 50-74(b)(1) hereof; the position must be one that does not require operation of equipment, machinery, or motor vehicles; and the position must be one which does not require direct contact with members of the public. 
                  (2)  The position must be one that is in existence and vacant at the time of the voluntary admission; i.e., a position may not be created for the employee. 
                  (3)  The employee must, at his or her own expense (to the extent not covered by any applicable insurance), immediately enter into evaluation and treatment with a substance abuse professional ("SAP"), in accordance with the terms and conditions prescribed under 49 CFR Part 40, which terms and conditions are incorporated herein by reference. The employee must comply with the treatment plan prescribed by the SAP, and shall provide evidence of same to the county upon request. 
                  (4)  The employee must, prior to transfer, present written certification from the SAP that he or she is capable of performing the duties of the proposed new position. 
                  (5)  The employee shall, until satisfactory completion of the treatment program and certification of fitness to return to a safety sensitive position, in accordance with the terms and conditions set out in 49 CFR Part 40, submit to drug and alcohol testing upon request. Failure to so submit, or a confirmed positive test, shall result in immediate dismissal. 
                  (6)  The position vacated by the employee upon his or her voluntary admission shall not be held open; however, upon satisfactory completion of the treatment program and certification of fitness to return to a safety sensitive position, in accordance with the terms and conditions set out in 49 CFR Part 40, the employee may apply and be considered for employment for vacant safety-sensitive positions in the same manner as any other county employee or applicant. 
                  (7)  For purposes of determining whether a vacant position requires operation of a motor vehicle, it shall be presumed that all positions of employment in the county require the employee to hold the license and ability to operate a motor vehicle unless at least 75 percent of the positions within the department, or three positions within the department, whichever is greater, are already filled by employees holding such license and ability. 
                  (8)  Failure to comply with any of the terms and conditions hereunder, including, but not limited to, failure to seek or make adequate progress in evaluation and treatment, or failure to provide evidence same upon request, shall constitute grounds for immediate dismissal.

                  Sec. 58-161. - Policy. 
                  (a)  Private roads constructed or established after the effective date of this article shall not be accepted into the county road system unless the road meets all standards set forth in the Madison County Roads Ordinance and, if applicable, the Madison County Subdivision Regulations. 
                  (b)  Private roads established or constructed prior to the effective date of this article and which do not meet current county road standards (as may be amended from time to time) may be accepted by the board into the county road system if the following criteria are met and procedures followed: 
                  (1)  Any person desiring the board to accept a private road shall confer with the chairman of the board and the county road superintendent to address issues, including, but not limited to, current road condition; appropriate right-of-way width if road is accepted; estimated cost of maintenance/improvement; appropriate routing of road if accepted; whether rights-of-way should be acquired in fee simple, by lease, or other manner; and other such issues. 
                  (2)  The road superintendent and chairman shall determine the appropriate width and routing, have right-of-way acquisition document(s) or prepared as necessary to obtain the determined width and route, and give such right-of-way acquisition document(s) over to the person for him or her to obtain the required signatures of each and every owner, appropriately witnessed and notarized. 
                  (3)  Once the person has obtained the required signatures on 100 percent of the right-of-way acquisition document(s), he or she shall turn the original right-of-way acquisition document(s) over to the county clerk for verification that all have been appropriately executed. Upon such verification, the clerk shall place the issue on the next available board agenda, and shall notify the person as well as the road superintendent to be present at that board meeting. 
                  (4)  The board shall, at that meeting, consider whether to accept the road, applying the following criteria: 
                  a.  The road must be regularly used by county or other governmental agencies to provide services to residents thereon (e.g., school buses, U.S. Postal Service, ambulance, fire and police protection). 
                  b.  The road must provide the only means of egress and ingress to at least three residences, each occupied by one or more persons. 
                  c.  The residences referenced above must each have a road name/number assigned by the county's 9-1-1 service. 
                  d.  In deciding whether to accept a road, the board shall receive and consider information related to the options for improving and/or maintaining the road, the cost of such options, and available funds. As a general rule, the board will accept annually into the county road system no more miles of private roads not meeting county paved road specifications than the miles of unpaved road that have been formally abandoned, improved to paved road specifications, or otherwise removed from the county road system during the same annual period. 
                  e.  The county, if it accepts a road, shall not be required to improve such road to current standards, but rather the board shall consider the appropriate level of improvement and maintenance to be provided in light of all relevant criteria. 
                  f.  The board may direct the person or the road superintendent to gather and provide additional information to be provided at a later time. 
                  g.  Once the board has been presented all information it has requested, it shall vote to accept or reject the road, applying the criteria set forth herein. If the road is rejected, the right-of-way acquisition document(s) shall be considered rejected, shall not be recorded, and shall be destroyed. If the road is accepted, the board shall determine the appropriate level of maintenance/improvement to be initially provided and shall assign the priority of such work in the context of the county's road improvement and maintenance schedule, and such direction shall be included in the motion to accept the road. 
                  (c)  Nothing herein shall be construed to restrict the board's discretion to acquire right-of-way by purchase, gift, or condemnation for the construction or improvement of new or existing county roads, nor to restrict the board's discretion to establish special tax districts for the construction of new roads or improvement and/or maintenance of existing roads. 
                  (d)  In exceptional cases where public safety concerns are implicated, the board may waive the requirement that the person requesting acceptance of a private road provide signatures for 100 percent of the right-of-way and instead employ the means available to the county, including the power of eminent domain, to acquire part or all of the required right-of-way.

                  AN ORDINANCE TO ESTABLISH AN ANNEXATION DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS BETWEEN THE CITY OF COLBERT, GEORGIA AND MADISON COUNTY, GEORGIA 
                  THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLBERT HEREBY ORDAINS THAT: 
                  Whereas, the Georgia General Assembly has mandated that all municipalities and local county governments implement a strategy to resolve land use disputes over annexation, pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 36-70-24(4)(c) the City of Colbert hereby adopts the following ordinance: 
                  The City of Colbert, Georgia and Madison County, Georgia hereby agree to implement the following process for resolving land use disputes over annexation, effective July 1, 1998: 
                  1.  Prior to initiating any formal annexation activities, the city will notify the county government of a proposed annexation and provide information on location of property, size of area, and proposed land use or zoning classification(s) (if applicable) of the property upon annexation. 
                  Within five working days following receipt of the above information, the county will forward to the city a statement either: 
                  (a)  Indicating that the county has no objection to the proposed land use for the property; or 
                  (b)  Describing its bona fide objection(s) to the city's proposed land use classification, providing supporting information, and listing any possible stipulations or conditions that would alleviate the county's objection(s); 
                  2.  If the county has no objection to the city's proposed land use or zoning classification, the city is free to proceed with the annexation. If the county fails to respond to the city's notice in writing within the deadline, the city is free to proceed with the annexation and the county loses its right to invoke the dispute resolution process, stop the annexation or object to land use changes after the annexation. 
                  3.  If the county notifies the city that it has a bona fide land use classification objection(s), the city will respond to the county in writing within five working days of receiving the county's objection(s) by either: 
                  (a)  Agreeing to implement the county's stipulations and conditions and thereby resolving the county's objection(s); 
                  (b)  Agreeing with the county and stopping action on the proposed annexation; 
                  (c)  Disagreeing that the county's objection(s) are bona fide and notifying the county that the city will seek a declaratory judgment in court; or 
                  (d)  Initiating a 30-day (maximum) mediation process to discuss possible compromises. 
                  4.  If the city initiates mediation, the city and county will agree on a mediator, mediation schedule and determine participants in the mediation. The city and county agree to share equally any costs associated with the mediation. 
                  5.  If no resolution of the county's bona fide land use classification objection(s) results from the mediation, the city will not proceed with the proposed annexation until two months have elapsed, at which time the city shall then have the options available in paragraph 3, above. 
                  6.  If the city and county reach agreement as described in step 3(a) or as a result of the mediation, they will draft an annexation agreement for execution by the city and county governments and the property owner(s).
