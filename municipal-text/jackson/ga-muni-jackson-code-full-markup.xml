PREFACE 
</p>
        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE This volume is a republication of The Code of Jackson, Georgia, originally published in 1996, with certain revisions as directed by the city. 
The Preface to the 1996 codification is set out below: 
This Code constitutes a complete codification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Jackson, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative table appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Palmer Carr, Supervising Editor, and Robert MacNaughton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Mayor Charles J. Brown, Ms. Jeanene Fitzgerald, City Clerk, and Mr. Richard G. Milam, City Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

                  (1)  Engage in any business or transaction or have a financial or other personal interest, direct or indirect, which is incompatible with the proper discharge of that person's official duties or which would tend to impair the independence of that person's judgment or action in the performance of that person's official duties;

                  Sec. 1-8. - Provisions considered continuations of existing ordinances. 
                  The provisions appearing in this Code, so far as they are the same as ordinances adopted prior to this Code and included in such Code, shall be considered as continuations thereof and not as new enactments.

                  (a)  All ordinances passed subsequent to this Code which amend, repeal or in any way affect this Code may be numbered in accordance with the numbering system of this Code and printed for inclusion herein. In the case of repealed chapters, sections and subsections or any part thereof, by subsequent ordinances, such repealed portions may be excluded from the Code by omission from reprinted pages affected thereby. The subsequent ordinances as numbered and printed or omitted, in the case of repeal, shall be prima facie evidence of such subsequent ordinances until such time that this Code and subsequent ordinances numbered or omitted are readopted as a new Code by the city council. 
                  (b)  Amendments to any of the provisions of this Code may be made by amending such provisions by specific reference to the section number of this Code.

All sentences may be in the alternative and fines may be imposed with the alternative of sentence to imprisonment and labor in the event the fines are not paid.

                  ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

                  Sec. 2-1. - Adoption of ordinances. 
                  An ordinance may be introduced by the mayor or any councilmember and be read at a regular or special meeting of the city council. The ordinance, if approved by a majority vote of the council, must be submitted to the city attorney for approval as to form and must be advertised a minimum of one time in the county's legal organ. The city clerk shall distribute a copy of the ordinance to the mayor and each councilmember and shall file a reasonable number of copies in the office of the city clerk. The council will consider adoption or rejection of an ordinance only at a regular meeting after it has been approved in form by the city attorney and properly advertised. This procedure does not apply to emergency ordinances as provided in section 2.24 of the city Charter.

                  Sec. 2-2. - Credit card payments. 
                  (a)  All sums due the city including, but not limited to, ad valorem taxes, occupation taxes, fines, forfeitures, penalties, license fees, permit fees and registration fees may be paid by the use of credit cards. The city council will establish the procedures for acceptance of credit card payments for amounts due the city. The mayor is authorized to enter into agreements with credit card issuers to facilitate the acceptance of credit card payments by the city. 
                  (b)  A credit card agreement may provide for the acceptance of the credit card payments from the credit card company at a discount from the face amount of the payment or for the withholding of administrative fees from the face amount of the payment. Such discounted fee is granted in exchange for the improved governmental cash flow, reduction of administrative expenses and increased public convenience as a result of credit card payments. 
                  (c)  A surcharge equal to the administrative fees charged by the credit card issuer to the city shall be imposed upon any person making a payment by credit card, when such surcharges are permitted by the operating rules and regulations of the credit card issuer. 
                  (d)  Any agreement with a credit card issuer for the acceptance of payments via credit shall contain a provision that the agreement may be canceled at any time by the city. 
                  (e)  No person making payment by credit card to the city is relieved from liability for the underlying obligation except to the extent that the city actually receives final payment of the obligation in cash or its equivalent. If final payment is not made by the credit card issuer or other guarantor of payment in the credit card transaction, the underlying obligation for the money due is not extinguished. All applicable penalties, interest and collection fees on the unpaid amount shall be due from the person making the payment by credit card. Such penalties, interest and fees on an unpaid amount shall accrue from the date the unpaid obligation was first due under the applicable statute or ordinance. The city shall follow the collection procedures for the unpaid amount that would have otherwise been applicable had the credit card payment not been attempted.

                  Editor's note— Pursuant to an ordinance adopted June 5, 1972, the city established a retirement plan for city employees. The subject ordinance set forth the joint trust agreement and the contract for the administration of such plan by the city and the Georgia Municipal Employees Benefit System as provided by O.C.G.A. § 47-5-1 et seq. An official copy of the retirement plan and amendments is on file in the office of the city clerk. 

                  DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

                  Sec. 2-31. - Personnel system established. 
                  The city hereby creates a personnel system establishing rules and procedures which shall serve as a guide to administrative action concerning various personnel activities and operations. These rules and regulations shall cover all employees except the city manager, the assistant city manager and the city clerk. These rules and regulations shall be administered by the city clerk.

                  Editor's note— The city's handbook of personnel policies is compiled and published separately by the city. An official copy of the handbook is on file in the office of the city clerk.

                  The mayor and each councilmember shall be entitled to reimbursement for actual expenses incurred while representing the city. The amount of reimbursement and the procedure for reimbursement shall be the same as that shown for employees in the city handbook. 
                  (Ord. No. 96-4, 1-2-1996) 
                  Sec. 2-33. - Political activities of employees. 
                  (a)  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish rules and procedures for deciding whether a city employee may continue in such employment upon qualifying as a candidate for nomination or election to any public office. 
                  (b)  Generally. This section shall establish the procedure and rules by which the city council shall decide whether a city employee shall continue in such employment upon qualifying as a candidate for nomination or election to any public office. The city council hereby finds and declares that the city Charter, article II, section 2.14(f), is overbroad in its absolute prohibition against any city employee continuing such employment upon qualifying as a candidate for nomination or election to any public office. The purpose of such subparagraph was to prevent conflicts of interest detrimental to the citizens of the city. The following rules shall apply in all cases where an employee of the city wishes to qualify as a candidate for nomination or election to any public office: 
                  (1)  Generally, no appointed officer of the city shall be allowed to continue in such employment upon qualifying as a candidate for nomination or election to any public office. However, an appointed officer may seek a decision from the city council that an exception should be made in his case, because the public office is not inconsistent, incompatible or in conflict with the duties of the appointed office. Those appointed officers serving at the pleasure of the mayor are not entitled to any type of hearing before the city council. Those appointed officers serving at the pleasure of the city council may make application for a hearing, but nothing contained in this section changes the fact that the employment of an appointed officer may be terminated at any time for any reason or no reason, unless such a person has a specific contract of employment for a stated period of time. 
                  (2)  No employee of the city shall continue in such employment upon election to any public office in the city or any other public office which is inconsistent, incompatible or in conflict with the duties of the city employee. Such determination shall be made by the city council, following a hearing. 
                  (3)  A city employee wishing to seek public office will be required to notify the city council of his intentions. The city council shall carefully consider whether campaigning for and/or serving in the particular public office will be inconsistent, incompatible or in conflict with the duties of the particular city employee. After considering all of the facts and circumstances relevant upon the issue, the city council may take the following action: 
                  a.  If the city council believes that the campaign activities required to obtain the public office are inconsistent, incompatible or in conflict with the duties of the city employee, it may require in its discretion that the city employee take leave without pay for the period of time that is in its opinion necessary. Nothing in this section prevents a city employee otherwise entitled to vacation, annual leave or other types of leave to take same in lieu of leave without pay, to the extent available to the employee. 
                  b.  If the city council is of the opinion that campaigning for the public office can be accomplished in a way not inconsistent, incompatible or in conflict with the duties of the city employee, it may allow the employee to remain an active employee of the city during the time between qualification and election, or it may allow the employee to modify his work schedule or duties so as to avoid any such problem. 
                  c.  If the city council believes that the public office sought is inconsistent, incompatible or in conflict with the duties of the city employee, it may decide that the employee must either take leave without pay or forfeit his employment with the city. The commencement of such leave or forfeiture may either be the day of election to the office or the day of taking office, depending on the city council's opinion as to when the inconsistency, incompatibility or conflict will arise. 
                  d.  If the city council is of the opinion that the public office sought will not create an unacceptable inconsistency, incompatibility or conflict with the duties of the city employee, it may allow the city employee to continue his employment without change or it may modify the schedule or duties of the city employee so as to avoid any such problem. 
                  e.  Because employment with the city and holding public office are ongoing and sometimes changing responsibilities, the city council may reconsider its decision at a later time, but only after notice to the employee and a full hearing before the city council. Reconsideration could only be had when there is a substantial change of circumstances materially affecting the employee's job performance as a city employee. Such change of circumstances could be a change in the duties and responsibilities of the public office from those in effect at the time of the previous hearing or a change in the duties and responsibilities of the employee in his job with the city since the time of the previous hearing. Under no circumstances will a city employee's employment with the city be affected in any way by his decisions while serving in public office. Under no circumstances would the city council attempt to influence an employee's performance as a public official by use of any power contained in this section. After such a reconsideration hearing, the city council would have the full range of options that it had at the first hearing, but it could never impose any condition retroactively. 
                  (c)  Notice and hearing. 
                  (1)  Notice required. Any person actively employed by the city, either on a full-time or part-time basis, must notify the city council in writing within five business days of qualifying as a candidate for nomination or election to any public office. Notification shall be considered received by the city when delivered to the city clerk. Any employee desiring to have the city council make a decision in advance of his qualification as a candidate may obtain such a decision by notifying the city council of his proposed qualification at least five days prior to a regular meeting of the city council scheduled before the deadline for qualification as a candidate. 
                  (2)  Content of notice. The city employee shall provide written notice containing the following: 
                  a.  Full name and social security number of the employee; 
                  b.  Job title with the city; 
                  c.  Official title and jurisdiction of the public office to be sought; and 
                  d.  A written statement from the employee as to how he plans to fully perform his duties for the city while seeking and serving in such public office. 
                  (3)  Hearing and decision. 
                  a.  Upon receiving notice as described in this subsection, the city clerk shall place the issue upon the next regularly scheduled meeting of the city council, where the issue will be decided under the same rules of procedure as in personnel matters. 
                  b.  The employee wishing to seek public office shall have the right to attend the hearing and address the councilmembers, and the council shall be entitled to address questions concerning relevant issues to the employee. 
                  c.  The council may consider any matter that it considers relevant including, but not limited to, the following: 
                  1.  The complete personnel file of the employee or appointed officer. 
                  2.  Any official statement of the qualifications, powers, duties and geographical jurisdiction of the public office to be sought. 
                  3.  The testimony or written statements of supervisory personnel and the department superintendent of the employee seeking public office. 
                  (4)  Reconsideration. At any time after a hearing and decision under this section, the city council may decide that a reconsideration is in order because of substantial changes in circumstances materially affecting the employee's job performance. Such a hearing can only be conducted based upon facts and circumstances which arose after the first hearing or which were not reasonably available to the city council at the first hearing. In order to conduct such a hearing, the city council must first serve upon the employee a notice stating specifically how the public office held by the employee or the city job of the employee, or both, have changed in duties, responsibilities, jurisdiction or otherwise and how such changes substantially affect the employee's job performance so as to make the public office inconsistent, incompatible or in conflict with the duties of the employee. Such notice would inform the employee of the time and date of the hearing, which would be no sooner than five days following the service of notice. The hearing would be conducted in the same manner as the first hearing, with the limitations upon issues raised stated herein and in subsection (b)(3)e of this section.

                  By my signature below, I certify that I have received and reviewed a complete copy of the attached materials explaining the requirements of the city's drug and alcohol testing policies and procedures. I understand that my failure to abide by the city's drug and alcohol testing policy is grounds for termination of employment.

                  Sec. 2-45. - Prohibitions of alcohol and drug use. 
                  (a)  Alcohol use. Drivers are prohibited from reporting for duty or remaining on duty requiring the performance of safety-sensitive functions while having an alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater. Drivers with an alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater will be immediately removed from safety-sensitive functions. A driver whose test results indicate an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater, but less than 0.04, will not be allowed to perform safety-sensitive functions until the start of the driver's next regularly scheduled duty period, but not less than 24 hours following the alcohol test. Drivers are prohibited from possessing or using alcohol while on duty. Drivers are prohibited from performing safety-sensitive functions within four hours after using alcohol. Following an accident, drivers are prohibited from using alcohol for eight hours or until undergoing a post-accident test. Misuse of alcohol is grounds for discharge from the city. 
                  (b)  Drug use. Drivers are prohibited from reporting for duty or remaining on duty requiring the performance of safety-sensitive functions when the driver uses drugs, unless the use is due to a physician's instruction that has advised the driver that the substance does not adversely affect the driver's ability to safely operate a motor vehicle. The driver must inform the employer of any such therapeutic drug use. If tested positive for drugs, drivers are prohibited from reporting for duty, remaining on duty, or performing a safety function. A positive test for use of controlled substances is grounds for discharge from the city. 
                  (c)  Refusal of test. Refusal to submit to a drug or alcohol test has the same consequences as a positive test result. If a driver fails to provide an adequate testing sample without a valid medical explanation or engages in conduct that obstructs the testing process, that driver will be deemed to have refused to submit to testing. 
                  (Ord. No. 96-8, § II, 1-2-1996) 
                  Sec. 2-46. - Types of testing. 
                  (a)  Preemployment testing. A driver applicant whom the city intends to hire or use shall be tested for the use of drugs, but not alcohol, as a condition of qualification for employment. A drug test is also required whenever a current employee moves into a safety-sensitive position. No driver shall perform any safety-sensitive functions until a preemployment test has indicated a verified negative result. 
                  (b)  Post-accident testing. As soon as possible after a reportable accident, every driver who was performing safety-sensitive functions with respect to the vehicle, if the accident involved the loss of human life, or who receives a citation for a moving traffic violation arising from the accident shall be tested for alcohol and drug use. If an alcohol test is not performed within two hours of the accident, the city will prepare and maintain on file a record stating why the test was not promptly administered. If an alcohol test has not been conducted within eight hours of the accident, no test will be conducted, and the city will maintain the same record. If a drug test has not been administered within 32 hours of the accident, no test will be administered, and the city will maintain on file a statement of the reasons the test was not promptly administered. If a driver subject to post-accident testing does not remain readily available for such testing, he will be deemed to have refused to submit to testing. However, a driver is allowed to get necessary emergency medical attention for injured people, or, if necessary, to leave the scene of an accident for the period necessary to obtain assistance in responding to the accident, or to obtain necessary emergency medical care. The driver is responsible for ensuring that he complies with this section of the city's drug and alcohol testing program. 
                  (c)  Random testing. All drivers are subject to unannounced drug and alcohol testing. A random selection process will be used to select drivers to be tested. Each driver will have an equal chance of being tested each time selections are made. At least 50 percent of all drivers subject to testing will be tested each year for drug use. At least 25 percent of all drivers subject to testing will be tested each year for alcohol use. The dates of testing will be spread reasonably throughout the calendar year. Drivers will be tested for alcohol use while performing safety-sensitive functions, just before performing safety-sensitive functions, or just after performing such functions. 
                  (d)  Reasonable suspicion testing. A driver shall submit to testing whenever the city has reasonable suspicion to believe that the driver is using a prohibited drug or is using alcohol in a prohibited manner. A decision to test will be made based on specific, contemporaneous, articulable observations concerning the appearance, behavior, speech or body odors of the driver. The observations may include indications of the chronic and withdrawal effects of controlled substances. The term "reasonable suspicion" means that the city believes that the appearance, behavior, speech or body odors of the driver are indicative of the use of drugs or alcohol. A reasonable suspicion of drug or alcohol use will be made by a supervisor or, when possible, two supervisors. A reasonable suspicion of alcohol misuse can only be made during, or just before or after, that period of the workday when the driver is engaged in the performance of a safety-sensitive function. After observation of suspect conduct, the driver should be transported immediately to a testing site. Once behavioral, speech, and performance indicators show a driver is under the influence of or impaired by alcohol, the driver must not report for, or remain on duty requiring the performance of safety-sensitive functions. A driver will only be permitted to resume performance after an alcohol test shows the driver's alcohol concentration at less than 0.02 or 24 hours have elapsed following the determination of reasonable suspicion. If an alcohol test is not administered within two hours following the supervisor's observation, a statement of the reasons for the delay must be prepared and maintained on file. If an alcohol test is not administered within eight hours, the driver will not be tested, and a statement of the reasons for failure to administer the test will be prepared and maintained on file. Within 24 hours of the observations being made or before the results of the drug test are released, whichever is earlier, documentation of the suspicion must be prepared and signed by the supervisor or company official who made the observations. 
                  (e)  Return-to-duty testing. Any driver who has engaged in prohibited drug or alcohol use must undergo a drug or alcohol test before returning to duty requiring the performance of safety-sensitive functions. A drug test must indicate a verified negative result for drug use. An alcohol test must indicate an alcohol concentration of less than 0.02. 
                  (f)  Follow-up testing. A driver who returns to duty after a positive test is subject to follow-up testing. If a substance abuse professional determines that a driver needs help in resolving drug or alcohol abuse problems, follow-up drug and alcohol testing will be administered as directed by that substance abuse professional. At least six tests are required in the first 12 months following the driver's return to duty. Follow-up testing will not exceed 60 months from the date of the driver's return to duty. After the first six tests, a driver may be released from the requirement of follow-up testing if the substance abuse professional determines that such testing is no longer necessary.

                  Sec. 2-47. - Drug testing procedures. 
                  Drug testing procedure will be in accordance with the federal DOT's drug testing procedures at 49 CFR 40. Drug testing will be performed using urine samples. The driver will be tested for marijuana, cocaine, opiates, amphetamines and phencyclidine (PCP). Upon notification that a drug test is required, a driver must report immediately to a drug collection site. Unreasonable delay in reporting to a site after notification will be deemed a refusal to submit to testing.

                  Sec. 2-48. - Alcohol testing procedures. 
                  Alcohol testing procedures will be in accordance with the federal DOT's alcohol testing procedures at 49 CFR 40. The test will be performed using breath or saliva samples. Upon notification that an alcohol test is required, a driver must report immediately for alcohol testing and provide a breath or saliva specimen. If a driver fails to report to a testing facility in a reasonable time, that driver will be deemed to have refused to submit to alcohol testing. If the result of the initial test is an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater, a confirmation test will be performed. For the purposes of this policy, alcohol means the intoxicating agent in beverage alcohol, ethyl alcohol, or other low molecular weight alcohols including methyl and isopropyl alcohol in any beverage, mixture, or preparation, including any medication. 
                  (Ord. No. 96-8, § V, 1-2-1996) 
                  Sec. 2-49. - Supervisory training. 
                  The city has established an education and training component for supervisory personnel who are authorized to determine whether reasonable suspicion exists to require a driver to undergo reasonable suspicion testing under this policy. Every such supervisor shall receive at least two hours of training on the specific indicators of probable drug or alcohol abuse.

In addition, federal, state and local officials will have access to all records and facilities used in complying with drug and alcohol program laws. The city will release a driver's record to a subsequent employer, or other person identified by a driver, upon receipt of a written request from the driver. The subsequent employer or other individual may only disclose the information as expressly authorized by the driver. The city may also provide information to a driver or decision maker when a grievance or other proceeding has been initiated by or on behalf of the driver which arises from the results of a drug or alcohol test given by the city or from the city's determination that the driver engaged in prohibited conduct. Such proceedings may pertain, for example, to workers' compensation, unemployment compensation, or other claims or benefits sought by the driver.

                  Sec. 2-53. - Release of test information by previous employers. 
                  Within 14 days of the first time a driver performs a safety-sensitive function for the city, the city is required by law to obtain information from a driver's previous employer on the driver's positive drug test results, alcohol test results of 0.04 or greater and refusals to be tested for drugs or alcohol within the preceding two years. This information must be obtained with the consent of the driver. Other information relating to a driver's drug and alcohol use may be obtained, pursuant to the driver's consent, by the city. Any such request must be accompanied by the driver's written authorization for release of the information. Refusal to consent to release of this information by the driver has the same consequences as a positive test result.

                  Sec. 2-54. - Referral, evaluation, and treatment. 
                  (a)  Any driver, except for any driver applicant, who tests positive for drug use or alcohol misuse, will be advised of the resources available to the driver in evaluating and resolving problems associated with the misuse of alcohol and use of drugs including the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of substance abuse professionals and counseling and treatment programs. The city will bear the cost of providing this referral information. 
                  (b)  In order for a driver who has tested positive for drug use or alcohol misuse to return to a position requiring the performance of a safety-sensitive function, that driver must be evaluated by a substance abuse professional who will determine what assistance, if any, the driver needs in resolving problems associated with alcohol misuse and drug use. Any driver identified as needing assistance in resolving such problems must successfully complete any rehabilitation program that is prescribed by a substance abuse professional before performing a safety-sensitive function. Follow-up testing will be conducted under the supervision of the substance abuse professional. Evaluation, assistance, rehabilitation, and follow-up testing will be obtained, if at all, at the cost of the driver. The city will not bear the cost of counseling, care or treatment. Because all drivers are at-will employees, the city will be under no obligation to rehire any driver whose employment was terminated because of substance abuse.

                  (g)  No emergency power as set forth herein may be effective for more than 72 hours after the declaration of an emergency by the mayor.

                  (i)  Violation of any section of this division or of any order of the mayor under this division shall be punishable by a fine of up to $500.00 and/or 30 days or both in the city jail.

                  Sec. 2-89. - Decorum. 
                  All councilmembers must conduct themselves in a professional and respectful manner. A councilmember is not allowed to speak at a meeting until he has been recognized by the mayor. All comments made by a councilmember shall address the motion being discussed. The mayor shall enforce these rules of decorum. If a councilmember believes that a rule has been broken, he can raise a point of order. A second is not required. The mayor can rule on the question or he can allow the council to debate the issues and decide the issue by majority vote. 
                  (Ord. No. 96-5, § 1.10, 1-2-1996) 
                  Sec. 2-90. - Public participation. 
                  Public participation in meetings of the council shall be permitted in accordance with the following provisions of this section: 
                  (1)  Public comments. The final agenda item of the meetings shall be reserved for comments from the public relating to matters that were either on the published agenda, added to the agenda or the subject of discussion by the mayor and city council at the meeting. Individuals from the public will be allotted five minutes to make their comments and their comments must be limited to their announced topic. Public comment on matters that were neither on the agenda nor discussed at the meeting will not be allowed without a majority vote of the council. These limits can be waived by a majority vote of the council. 
                  (2)  Public participation on agenda items. Public comment on an agenda item at the time the item is being considered by the council is allowed. These comments must be limited to the subject that is being debated. Members of the public may speak for five minutes and may only speak once. This privilege or these limits can be waived by a majority vote of the council. Anyone wishing to speak at any council meeting must be recognized by the mayor before addressing the council. 
                  (3)  Decorum. Members of the public shall not make inappropriate or offensive comments at a council meeting and are expected to comply with the rules of decorum that are established for the mayor and council. Individuals who violate any rules of the council may be ruled out of order by the mayor or on a point of order made by a councilmember. A majority vote of the council will rule on the point of order. Any individual who violates the rules of decorum may be removed from the meeting at the direction of the mayor. 
                  (4)  Public hearings. The council may schedule public hearings for the purpose of soliciting public comment on any subject of interest to the council. Hearings may be held immediately prior to, during, or following a meeting of the council or at such other places and times as the council may determine. No official action shall be taken at any such public hearing unless it is conducted during a regular or called meeting of the council.

                  Sec. 2-92. - Amendments to rules. 
                  Any amendments to these rules of order must be submitted by a councilmember in writing to the city clerk three business days before a regular meeting of the council. The proposed amendment shall be included in the agenda for that meeting and distributed to all councilmembers. All amendments require a majority vote of the council.

                  Rules of order may be suspended in the case of an emergency. A motion to suspend the rules requires a second, is debatable and requires a majority vote of the council. Rules governing quorum (section 2-81), voting methods and requirements (sections 2-82 and 2-83), the notification to councilmembers of meetings (sections 2-78 and 2-79) and rules necessary for compliance with state law cannot be suspended.

                  Sec. 2-94. - Committees. 
                  The mayor may create committees of members of the council to study any issue before the council. Any such committees may make recommendations to the council, but no committee shall be empowered to make any final decisions on any matter before it for consideration. In addition to councilmembers, committees may include other city officials, staff or citizens at large. Whenever a committee is created, its duties, any limitation of the scope of its duties, and the times, places and periods of time for which the committee may operate shall be determined by the mayor.

                  DIVISION 3. - PARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURE 

                  Sec. 2-116. - Main motion. 
                  In order for the council to take any official action on any subject, a councilmember must propose a main motion. A proposed main motion will not be recognized by the mayor until another councilmember agrees to second the motion. A second does not require the councilmember seconding the motion to support the motion. A councilmember may withdraw a main motion that he has made at any time before the council has voted on that motion. 
                  (Ord. No. 96-6, § 1.01, 1-2-1996) 
                  Sec. 2-117. - Debate. 
                  After the main motion is recognized by the mayor, the council shall debate the motion. The debate shall be managed by the mayor in a manner that is fair to all members of the council. Councilmembers can participate in the debate only when they are recognized by the mayor. During the course of debate, councilmembers may introduce subsidiary motions that propose that the council take a particular action on a motion (section 2-120). There are two classes of subsidiary motions: debatable subsidiary motions and undebatable subsidiary motions. Debatable subsidiary motions consist of motions to postpone indefinitely, amend, refer to committee, and postpone to a time certain. Debatable subsidiary motions require a second before they can be voted on or debated. There are three undebatable subsidiary motions: limit debate, vote immediately, and lay on the table. They require a second and cannot be debated. Councilmembers may also introduce privileged motions (section 2-122). Privileged motions facilitate the running of the meeting and can be introduced during the course of debate. Privileged motions consist of a motion to raise a question of privilege and motions to recess and adjourn. The motions to recess and adjourn require a second. Debate is not allowed on privileged motions. 
                  (Ord. No. 96-6, § 1.02, 1-2-1996) 
                  Sec. 2-118. - Voting procedure. 
                  Voting on debatable motions and voting on undebatable motions shall take place in accordance with the following provisions: 
                  (1)  Debatable motions. In the case of debatable motions, the vote can be proposed in one of two ways: 
                  a.  If debate has been completed and no other councilmember wishes to speak, the mayor can call for the vote. If there are no objections, then the mayor can proceed with the vote. 
                  b.  If the mayor calls for the vote and there is an objection, a councilmember may move to vote immediately (move the question). If this motion is seconded and approved by a majority vote, debate will stop. The mayor will then read the proposed motion to the council and ask for the votes of the council. 
                  (2)  Undebatable motions. In the case of undebatable motions, the vote shall occur immediately after the motion is recognized by the mayor. The mayor shall read the proposed motion to the council and then call for the vote. 
                  (Ord. No. 96-6, § 1.03, 1-2-1996) 
                  Sec. 2-119. - Ranking of motions. 
                  Each subsidiary and privileged motion is assigned a specific rank. A motion of higher precedence can interrupt a motion of lower precedence. The higher motion must be decided before the council returns to consider the motion of lower precedence. A main motion has the lowest rank and does not take precedence over any other motion. A motion to adjourn has the highest rank and will take precedence over all other subsidiary and privileged motions. The order of precedence of motions shall be in accordance with this section. Motions at the bottom of the following list take precedence over motions at the top of the list: 
                  (1)  Lowest rank, main motion. 
                  (2)  Subsidiary motions (debatable): 
                  a.  Postpone indefinitely; 
                  b.  Amend; 
                  c.  Refer to committee (commit); and 
                  d.  Postpone to a time certain. 
                  (3)  Subsidiary motions (undebatable): 
                  a.  Limit debate or extend limits; 
                  b.  Vote immediately (previous question); and 
                  c.  Lay on the table (postpone temporarily). 
                  (4)  Privileged motions (undebatable): 
                  a.  Question of privilege; 
                  b.  Recess; and 
                  c.  Highest rank, adjourn. 
                  (Ord. No. 96-6, § 1.04, 1-2-1996) 
                  Sec. 2-120. - Subsidiary motions. 
                  During the course of debate, councilmembers may introduce motions that propose that the council take a particular action on a main motion. These motions are called subsidiary motions, and they allow the council to reach a conclusion on the main motion. Subsidiary motions require a second before they can be voted on or debated. Three subsidiary motions: amend, limit debate, and vote immediately, can also apply to subsidiary motions. 
                  (1)  Postpone indefinitely. If a councilmember believes that the main motion should not be considered by the council, that councilmember may move to postpone the consideration of the main motion indefinitely. If the motion is successful, consideration of the main motion stops and the main motion is tabled. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (2)  Amend. If a councilmember believes that a main motion that is on the table should be changed in order to make it more acceptable, he can move to amend the motion. Amendments must be closely related to the original motion and must not change the nature of the motion that they amend. Motions to refer, amend, postpone to a time certain, and the motion to recess can also be amended. A motion cannot be amended more than two times. Debate is allowed on a motion to amend only if the original motion is debatable. A majority vote is required for the council to adopt an amendment. If the amendment is adopted, then the council shall consider the amended version of the motion. 
                  (3)  Refer to a committee (commit). If the mayor believes that further information is needed before the council can act on a main motion, the mayor may propose that the motion be referred to a specific committee or department for further study. If an appropriate committee does not already exist, then a committee may be formed as a part of the motion. A motion to refer should specify the date that the committee or department will report back to the council. 
                  (4)  Postpone to a time certain (postpone definitely). A motion to postpone to a certain time may be proposed if a councilmember believes that the main motion should not be considered until a future time. This motion shall set a particular time for the main motion to be considered again. It is debatable and can be amended. If this motion is passed, the mayor will bring the original motion back to the council for consideration at the specified time. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (5)  Limit or extend limits of debate. A motion to limit debate places a time constraint on the length of debate. The details of such a motion are to be decided by the councilmember who makes the motion. This motion can also be used to extend the limits of debate if a limit on debate already exists. Debate is not allowed on this motion and a majority vote is required. 
                  (6)  Vote immediately (previous question). If a councilmember believes that the motion that is being considered should be voted on, the councilmember can move to vote immediately. The motion is undebatable, and a majority vote is required. 
                  (Ord. No. 96-6, §§ 1.05.01—1.05.06, 1-2-1996) 
                  Sec. 2-121. - Lay on the table (postpone temporarily). 
                  A motion to lay on the table proposes that the consideration of a main motion be postponed until a later time in the meeting. The motion can be brought up for consideration only if a motion to resume consideration is accepted by the council during the same meeting. The motion will die if it is not taken up during the meeting. Debate is not allowed on this motion and the motion is not amendable. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (Ord. No. 96-6, § 1.05.07, 1-2-1996) 
                  Sec. 2-122. - Privileged motions. 
                  Privileged motions facilitate the running of the meeting. They do not address or relate to a main motion and can be introduced whether or not there is a main motion under consideration. Privileged motions take precedence over all subsidiary motions. Debate is not allowed on the following motions: 
                  (1)  Question of privilege. A formal question addressed to the mayor concerning the rights of a councilmember or of the council as a whole is referred to as a question of privilege. It does not require a second and cannot be debated or amended. The mayor is required to make a ruling on the question. 
                  (2)  Recess. A motion to recess proposes that the meeting be suspended for a particular amount of time. The motion must specify the length of the recess. The motion must also be seconded. Debate is not allowed on this motion, but the motion can be amended. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (3)  Adjourn. In order for a meeting to come to a close, a councilmember must make a motion to adjourn. The motion to adjourn has the highest rank of any motion and as a result it can be introduced at any time. The motion requires a second, but is not debatable or amendable. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (Ord. No. 96-6, § 1.06, 1-2-1996) 
                  Sec. 2-123. - Incidental motions. 
                  Incidental motions allow councilmembers to exert their right as a councilmember. The following incidental motions can be introduced at any time during a meeting: 
                  (1)  Appeal. If a councilmember disagrees with a decision that is made by the mayor, that councilmember may appeal the decision. If the appeal is seconded, the appeal will be considered by the council. The mayor has the opportunity to explain the ruling that has been challenged. The council may then debate the appeal. The council shall decide by majority vote if the mayor's decision is to be upheld or overturned. An appeal is high in precedence and can only be interrupted by a privileged motion or by a motion to lay on the table. 
                  (2)  Parliamentary inquiry. If a councilmember has a question about the rules of order, he may ask the mayor to give an opinion on that question. This question should take the form of a parliamentary inquiry and should relate to the current business of the council. This motion takes precedence over all motions except privileged motions. This motion does not require a second and is not debatable or amendable. 
                  (3)  Point of order (question of order). If a councilmember believes that a violation of the rules of parliamentary procedure has occurred, he can raise a point of order. A second is not required. The mayor can make a ruling on the question or can allow the council to debate and then rule on the question by majority vote. A point of order can only be interrupted by a privileged motion or a motion to lay on the table. 
                  (4)  Point of information (request for information). If a councilmember has a question about the facts of a particular issue that is being considered, he may ask a point of information. This motion is addressed first to the mayor and then to the appropriate person. A second is not required and the motion is not debatable or amendable. 
                  (Ord. No. 96-6, § 1.07, 1-2-1996) 
                  Sec. 2-124. - Supplementary main motions. 
                  Three motions allow the council to act on a main motion that has either been passed or tabled by the council. The following motions are considered to be main motions but differ from usual main motions in the ways specified: 
                  (1)  Reconsider. The motion to reconsider allows the council to debate whether or not to overturn a decision made at the meeting that is in progress. It allows the council to consider new information that may affect the decision that has already been made. Any councilmember can make a motion to reconsider and any councilmember may second the motion. The motion is debatable but it cannot be amended. A majority vote of the council is required for the motion to pass. If a motion to reconsider is passed, the original decision will be voided and the council will return to debate and vote the original motion. 
                  (2)  Rescind. A motion to rescind proposes that the council overturn a motion passed at a previous meeting. A motion to rescind can be made by any councilmember. It is in order as long as the original motion has not been implemented. An announcement of the intention to rescind a motion may be made at the meeting where the decision was made, or the councilmember seeking to rescind may place the matter on the agenda for the next meeting pursuant to section 2-86. The motion to rescind will then be placed on the agenda for the next meeting. At the next meeting, the motion to rescind will formally be made. If it is seconded, then the council shall debate and vote on rescission. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. If a motion to rescind is passed, the original decision will be voided. 
                  (3)  Resume consideration. The motion to resume consideration allows the council to consider a motion that has been temporarily postponed. This motion requires a second and is not debatable or amendable. It is a main motion but ranks higher than any debatable motion. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass.

                  (a)  Recomputation of tax; authority to make; basis of recomputation. If the license department is not satisfied with the return or returns of the tax or the amount of the tax or the amount of the tax required to be paid to the city by any person, it may compute and determine the amount required to be paid upon the basis of any information within its possession or that may be made of the amount due for one or more than one calendar month. 
                  (b)  Estimate of gross receipts in absence of a return. If any licensee fails to make a return, the license department shall make an estimate of the amount of the gross receipts of the licensee, or as the case may be, of the amount of the total sales in the city which are subject to the tax. The estimate shall be made for the period or periods in respect to which the licensee failed to make the return and shall be based upon any information which is or may come into the possession of the license department. Upon the basis of this estimate, the license department shall compute and determine the amount required to be paid to the city.

                  (b)  Duty of successors or assignees of operator to withhold tax from purchase money.

The time within which the obligation of a successor may be enforced shall begin at the time the licensee sells out his business or at the time that the determination against the licensee becomes final, whichever event occurs later.

The claim shall be audited. If the claim is approved by the city, the excess amount paid the city may be credited on amounts then due and payable from the licensee by whom it was paid or its administrators or executors.

                  (d)  Penalty for fraud or intent to evade.

                  Sec. 8-32. - Purpose. 
                  The purpose of this article is to regulate adult entertainment establishments, including but not limited to adult bookstores, adult movie houses, adult video stores or adult dancing establishments. Such establishments are known to attract persons involved in criminal activity. Such establishments tend to create an atmosphere and environment contrary to the best interests of minors. However, it is recognized that regulation of such businesses cannot be used to prohibit otherwise constitutionally protected forms of expression. The purpose of the policies and procedures contained in this article are to reduce the possibility of criminal activity, to avoid negative impact upon minors and neighborhoods and to provide a method whereby persons interested in conducting constitutionally-protected businesses can seek and obtain a permit to do so from the city government.

                  Sec. 8-68. - Permits nontransferable. 
                  No adult entertainment establishment permit may be sold, transferred or assigned by a permittee. This absolute prohibition against transfer applies to voluntary sales, transfers by operation of law, inheritance, automatic transfer to a bankruptcy trustee or other fiduciary or levy by creditors. If the permittee named in the permit issued ceases to do business under that permit in that location for any reason, the permit shall be automatically canceled and thereafter null and void. However, if the permittee is a partnership, and one or more of the partners should die, the surviving partner or partners may acquire, by purchase or otherwise, the interest of the deceased partner or partners without affecting a surrender or termination of such permit. In such case, the surviving partner may obtain a renewal of the permit in his own separate name from the city clerk, provided that the surviving partner is not otherwise disqualified from holding the permit.

Therefore, if an applicant wishes to relocate, the entire application procedure shall be recommenced as if no permit had ever been issued.

If the city council believes that there is any failure to maintain any of the qualifications to hold a permit, any variance between the permitted use and the actual use in violation of this article, any material misrepresentation in any application which was not discovered until after the permit was granted, any violation of any provision of this article or any other reason to believe that the continued operation of an adult entertainment establishment is harmful to the health, morals, peace and dignity of the community, then it shall issue to the permittee a notice of hearing. The notice shall include sufficient information for the permittee to prepare its defense and shall notify the permittee of the time and date of the hearing before the city council wherein the issue of revocation of the permit shall be decided. Such hearing shall be no less than ten days following the date that the notice is mailed to the address of the permittee. At the hearing, the permittee will be allowed to present evidence and examine any witness or evidence submitted before the city council. Following the hearing, the city council shall issue its written decision within a reasonable period of time and mail a copy to the permittee.

                  (2)  The permit may be modified so as to place reasonable restrictions upon the permittee's conduct of business for a reasonable period of time so as to deter or prevent a repeat of the type of conduct that led to the disciplinary action; or 
                  (3)  The permit may be revoked, effective immediately.

                  (2)  Violation of code provisions. The building official may revoke a permit upon determination by the building official that the construction erection, alteration, repair, moving, demolition, installation or replacement of the building, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical, or plumbing systems for which the permit was issued is in violation of, or not in conformity with, the provisions of the construction codes. 
                  (e)  Unsafe buildings or systems. All buildings, structures, electrical, gas, mechanical, or plumbing systems which are unsafe, unsanitary, or do not provide adequate egress, or which constitute a fire hazard, or are otherwise dangerous to human life, or which in relation to existing use, constitute a hazard to safety or health, are considered unsafe buildings or service systems. 
                  (f)  Requirements not covered by code.

The building permit application shall indicate the proposed occupancy of all parts of the building and of that portion of the site or lot, if any, not covered by the building or structure, and shall contain such other information as may be required by the building official. 
                  (5)  Time limitations. An application for a permit for any proposed work shall be deemed to have been abandoned six months after the date of filing for the permit, unless before then a permit has been issued. One or more extensions of time for periods of not more than 90 days each may be allowed by the building official for the application, provided the extension is requested in writing and justifiable cause is demonstrated. 
                  (b)  Drawings and specifications. 
                  (1)  Requirements.

                  c.  Buildings and structures 5,000 square feet (465 m 2 ) or more in area. 
                  For all other buildings and structures, the submittal shall bear the certification of the applicant that some specific state law exception permits its preparation by a person not so registered. 
                  EXCEPTION: Single-family dwellings, regardless of size, shall require neither a registered architect nor engineer, nor a certification that an architect or engineer is not required. 
                  (4)  Structural and fire resistance integrity. Plans for all buildings shall indicate how required structural and fire resistance integrity will be maintained where a penetration of a required fire resistance wall, floor, or partition will be made for electrical, gas, mechanical, plumbing, signal and communication conduits, pipes, and systems and also indicate in sufficient detail how the fire integrity will be maintained where required fire resistance floors intersect the exterior walls. 
                  (5)  Site drawings. Drawings shall show the location of the proposed building or structure and of every existing building or structure on the site or lot. The building official may require a boundary line survey prepared by a qualified surveyor. 
                  (6)  Hazardous occupancies. The building official may require the following: 
                  a.  General site plan.

                  (c)  Examination of documents. 
                  (1)  Plan review. The building official shall examine or cause to be examined each application for a permit and the accompanying documents, consisting of drawings, specifications, computations, and additional data, and shall ascertain by such examinations whether the construction indicated and described is in accordance with the requirements of the construction codes and all other pertinent laws or ordinances. 
                  (d)  Issuing permits. 
                  (1)  Action on permits. The building official shall act upon an application for a permit without unreasonable or unnecessary delay. If the building official is satisfied that the work described in an application for a permit and the contract documents filed therewith conform to the requirements of the construction codes and other pertinent laws and ordinances, he shall issue a permit to the applicant. 
                  (2)  Refusal to issue permit. If the application for a permit and the accompanying contract documents describing the work do not conform to the requirements of the construction codes or other pertinent laws or ordinances, the building official shall not issue a permit, but shall return the contract documents to the applicant with his refusal to issue such permit. Such refusal shall, when requested, be in writing and shall contain the reason for refusal. 
                  (3)  Special foundation permit. When application for permit to erect or enlarge a building has been filed and pending issuance of such permit, the building official may, at his discretion, issue a special permit for the foundation only. The holder of such a special permit is proceeding at his own risk and without assurance that a permit for the remainder of the work will be granted nor that corrections will not be required in order to meet provisions of the construction codes. 
                  (4)  Public right-of-way. A permit shall not be given by the building official for the construction of any building, or for the alteration of any building where said building is to be changed and such change will affect the exterior walls, bays, balconies, or other appendages or projections fronting on any street, alley, or public lane, or for the placing on any lot or premises of any building or structure removed from another lot or premises, unless the applicant has made application at the office of the director of public works for the lines of the public street on which he/she proposes to build, erect, or locate said building; and it shall be the duty of the building official to see that the street lines are not encroached upon. 
                  (e)  Contractor responsibilities. It shall be the duty of every contractor who shall make contracts for the installation or repairs of buildings, structures, electrical, gas, mechanical, sprinkler, or plumbing systems, for which a permit is required, to comply with state or local rules and regulations concerning licensing which the applicable governing authority may have adopted. In such case that the state requires a contractor to have obtained a state license before they are permitted to perform work, the contractor shall supply the local government with their license number before receiving a permit for work to be performed. 
                  (f)  Conditions of the permit. 
                  (1)  Permit intent. A permit issued shall be construed to be a license to proceed with the work and not as authority to violate, cancel, alter, or set aside any of the provisions of the construction codes, nor shall issuance of a permit prevent the building official from thereafter requiring a correction of errors in plans, construction, or violations of the construction codes. Every permit issued shall become invalid unless the work authorized by such permit is commenced within six months after its issuance, or if the work authorized by such permit is suspended or abandoned for a period of six months after the time the worked is commenced. One or more extensions of time, for periods not more than 90 days each, may be allowed for the permit. The extension shall be requested in writing and justifiable cause demonstrated. Extensions shall be in writing by the building official. 
                  (2)  Permit issued on basis of an affidavit. Whenever a permit is issued in reliance upon an affidavit or whenever the work to be covered by a permit involves installation under conditions which, in the opinion of the building official, are hazardous or complex, the building official shall require that the architect or engineer who signed the affidavit or prepared the drawings or computations shall supervise such work. In addition, they shall be responsible for conformity with the permit, provide copies of inspection reports as inspections are performed, and upon completion make and file with the building official written affidavit that the work has been done in conformity with the reviewed plans and with the structural provisions of the construction codes. In the event such architect or engineer is not available, the owner shall employ in his place, a competent person or agency whose qualifications are reviewed by the building official. 
                  (3)  Plans. When the building official issues a permit, he/she shall enforce, in writing or by stamp, both sets of plans "reviewed for code compliance." One set of drawings so reviewed shall be retained by the building official and the other set shall be returned to the applicant. The permitted drawings shall be kept at the site of work and shall be open to inspection by the building official or his/her authorized representative. 
                  (g)  Fees. 
                  (1)  Prescribed fees. A permit shall not be issued until the fees prescribed by the governing body have been paid. Nor shall an amendment to a permit be released until the additional fee, if any, due to an increase in the estimated cost of the building, structure, electrical, plumbing, mechanical, or gas systems, etc. has been paid. 
                  (2)  Work commencing before permit issuance. Any person who commences any work on a building, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical, or plumbing, etc. system before obtaining the necessary permits, shall be subject to a penalty of 100 percent of the usual permit fee in addition to the required permit fees. 
                  (3)  Accounting. The building official shall keep a permanent and accurate accounting of all permit fees and other money collected, the names of all persons upon whose account the same was paid, along with the date and amount thereof. 
                  (4)  Schedule of permit fees. On all buildings, structures, electrical, plumbing, mechanical, and gas systems or alterations requiring a permit, a fee for each permit shall be paid as required at the time of filing application, in accordance with the fee schedules as set by the governing body. 
                  (5)  Building permit valuations. If, in the opinion of the building official, the valuation of building, alteration, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical, or plumbing systems appears to be underestimated on the application, the permit shall be denied, unless the applicant can show detailed estimates to meet the approval of the building official. Permit valuations shall include total cost, such as electrical, gas, mechanical, plumbing equipment, and other systems, including materials and labor. 
                  (h)  Inspections. 
                  (1)  Existing building inspections. Before issuing a permit the building official may examine or cause to be examined any building, electrical, gas, mechanical, or plumbing systems for which an application has been received for a permit to enlarge, alter, repair, move, demolish, install, or change the occupancy. He shall inspect all buildings, structures, electrical, gas, mechanical, and plumbing systems, from time to time, during and upon completion of the work for which a permit was issued. He shall make a record of every such examination and inspection and of all violations of the construction codes. 
                  (2)  Manufacturers and fabricators. When deemed necessary by the building official he shall make, or cause to be made, an inspection of materials or assemblies at the point of manufacture or fabrication. A record shall be made of every such examination and inspection and of all violations of the construction codes. 
                  (3)  Inspection service. The building official may make, or cause to be made, the inspections required by subsection (6), herein below. He/she may accept reports of inspectors of recognized inspection services provided that after investigation he/she is satisfied as to their qualifications and reliability. A certificate called for by any provision of the construction codes shall not be based on such reports unless the same are in writing and certified by a responsible officer of such service. 
                  (4)  Inspections prior to issuance of certificate of occupancy or completion. The building official shall inspect or cause to be inspected at various intervals all construction or work for which a permit is required, and a final inspection shall be made of every building, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical, or plumbing system upon completion, prior to the issuance of the certificate of occupancy or completion. 
                  (5)  Posting of permit. Work requiring a permit shall not commence until the permit holder or his/her agent posts the permit card in a conspicuous place on the premises. The permit shall be protected from the weather and located in such position as to permit the building official or representative to conveniently make the required entries thereon. This permit card shall be maintained in such position by the permit holder until the certificate of occupancy or completion is issued by the building official. 
                  (6)  Required inspections. The building official upon notification from the permit holder or his agent shall make the following inspections and such other inspections as necessary, and shall either release that portion of the construction or shall notify the permit holder or his agent of any violations which must be corrected in order to comply with the technical code:

Regulatory fees do not include development impact fees as defined by O.C.G.A. § 36-71-2(8), or other costs or conditions of zoning or land development.

                  (10)  In order to maintain a high standard of care and to eliminate sunken graves caused by the collapse of wooden boxes, it is required that all materials be made, of reinforced concrete.

                  a.  Material: All monuments and/or markers and benches must be of first quality marble or granite. All monuments and markers are to be guaranteed for a period of five years against sap and components which cause rust stains, and from natural faults which might cause checks or cracks.

No holes are to be dug in the ground. The city reserves the right to remove any flowers, wreaths, flower pots, vases, trees, shrubs or objects of any kind, if, in the opinion of the city they become unsightly, or a menace to safety.

                  (a)  Declaration of local emergency. 
                  (1)  Grant of authority. In the event of an actual or threatened occurrence of a disaster or emergency, which may result in the large-scale loss of life, injury, property damage or destruction or in the major disruption of routine community affairs, business or governmental operations in the city and which is of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant extraordinary assistance by federal, state and local departments and agencies to supplement the efforts of available public and private resources, the mayor may declare a local emergency for the City of Jackson. The form of the declaration shall be similar to that provided in subsection (b) of this Code section. 
                  (2)  Request for state assistance. Consistent with a declaration of local emergency, the mayor may request the Governor to provide assistance, provided that the disaster or emergency is beyond the capacity of the city to meet adequately and state assistance is necessary to supplement local efforts to save lives and protect property, public health and safety, or to avert or lessen the threat of a disaster. 
                  (3)  Continuance. The declaration of local emergency shall continue until the mayor finds that emergency conditions no longer exist, at which time, the mayor shall execute and file with the city clerk a document marking the end of the state of emergency. No state of local emergency shall continue for longer than 30 days, unless renewed by the mayor. The city governing authority may, by resolution and in accordance with the city charter, end a state of local emergency at any time.

The city police chief (see subsection 30-32(a)(4)a.1.) is authorized to execute a right of entry and/or agreement to use property for these purposes on behalf of the city; however, any such document shall be later presented for ratification by the city governing authority. 
                  3.  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the city who requests entry for purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials. Nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while that individual is in the process of carrying out his or her official duties. 
                  b.  Emergency powers. Following a declaration of emergency and during the continuance of such state of emergency, the mayor is authorized to implement local emergency measures to protect life and property or to bring the emergency situation under control.

                  c.  Authority to waive procedures and fees. Pursuant to a declaration of emergency, the city governing authority is authorized to cause to be effective any of the subsections of section 30-34 of this chapter as appropriate.

                  8.  To suspend any law, code provision or regulation prescribing the procedures for conduct of city business, or the orders, rules or regulations of any city agency, if strict compliance with any ordinance, resolution, order, rule or regulation would in any way prevent, hinder or delay necessary action in coping with the emergency or disaster, provided that such suspension shall provide for the minimum deviation from the requirements under the circumstances and further provided that, when practicable, specialists shall be assigned to avoid adverse effects resulting from such suspension; 
                  9.  To provide welfare benefits to citizens upon execution of an intergovernmental agreement for grants to meet disaster-related necessary expenses or serious needs of individuals or families adversely affected by an emergency or disaster in cases where the individuals or families are unable to meet the expenses or needs from other means, provided that such grants are authorized only when matching state or federal funds are available for such purposes;

The existence of overcharging shall be presumed from a 25 percent or greater increase in the price at which the merchandise or rate, fee or cost/rental of housing was offered in the usual course of business immediately prior to the onset of the emergency or disaster, but shall not include increases in cost to the supplier directly attributable to the higher cost of material, supplies and labor costs resulting from the emergency. 
                  Subsequent recovery period means that period during which the emergency or disaster continues to cause disruptions in the area designated in the declaration of emergency, but shall not exceed three months after the declaration has been terminated, unless extended by action of the city governing authority.

                  (a)  Whenever a public officer issues a citation to a property owner as provided in this article, and the property owner fails to respond by taking the necessary action to correct the condition within ten days of the service of citation, the public officer shall notify the city clerk, who shall forthwith cause to be filed a complaint in the name of the city seeking to abate the condition on grounds it constitutes a public nuisance. The complaint shall state all charges giving rise to such action, including a reference to the specific code, regulation, ordinance or statute deemed to be violated, if any, and those facts known in support of the complaint. If the complaint is based upon the petition of five or more residents of the city, it shall identify the petitioners and the specific injury alleged.

                  (1)  If the repair, alteration or improvement of the dwelling, building or structure can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the value of the dwelling, building or structure, requiring the owner or parties in interest, within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter or improve such dwelling, building or structure so as to render it fit for human habitation or for current commercial, industrial or business use or to vacate, close and secure the dwelling, building or structure as a human habitation; or 
                  (2)  If the repair, alteration or improvement of the dwelling, building or structure cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the value of the dwelling, building or structure, requiring the owner or parties in interest, within the time specified in the order, to remove or demolish such dwelling, building or structure. 
                  In no event shall the court order the removal or demolition of any dwelling, building or structure except upon a finding, based upon competent evidence, that the cost of repair, alteration or improvement thereof exceeds one-half the value such dwelling, building or structure will have when repaired to satisfy the minimum requirements of law; provided, however, nothing contained in this section shall prevent the mayor and city council from exercising the power of eminent domain for the taking of such dwelling, building or structure for public purposes. 
                  (e)  If the owner or parties in interest fail to comply with an order to vacate, close and secure a dwelling, building or structure within the time specified therein, the city clerk may cause the dwelling, building or structure to be vacated, closed and secured and may post conspicuously thereon a placard with the following words: 
                  This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial or business use; the use or occupancy of this building for human habitation or for commercial, industrial or business use is strictly prohibited and unlawful. 
                  If the owner or parties in interest fail to comply with an order to remove and demolish a dwelling, building or structure within the time specified therein, the city clerk may cause the demolition thereof; provided, however, that such power may not be exercised until the mayor and city council shall have by resolution directed the city clerk to proceed. 
                  (f)  The cost of bringing a complaint pursuant to this article, together with any costs reasonably incurred by the city in abatement of a public nuisance after determination thereof by the municipal court, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred. Such lien shall attach to the real property upon the filing of an itemized statement of the total sum of the costs by the city clerk in the office of the city clerk on a lien docket maintained for such purposes. If a dwelling, building or structure is removed or demolished by the city, the city clerk shall sell in a commercially reasonable manner all salvageable materials therefrom and deduct the proceeds from the costs of demolition. Any surplus of proceeds over costs shall be paid to the owner and parties in interest. 
                  (g)  The city may enforce its lien in the following manner: 
                  (1)  The owner or parties in interest shall be allowed to satisfy the amount due on such lien by paying to the city, within 30 days after the perfection of such lien, a sum of money equal to 25 percent of the total amount due and by further paying the remaining balance due on such lien, together with interest at the rate of seven percent per annum, in three equal annual installments, each of which shall become due and payable on the anniversary date of the initial payment; 
                  (2)  Should the property upon which such lien is perfected be sold, transferred or conveyed by the owner or parties in interest at any time prior to the termination of the three-year period, then the entire balance due on such lien shall be due and payable to the city; and 
                  (3)  Should the amount due on such lien, or any portion thereof, not be paid as provided in this section or be unpaid after the passage of the three-year period, the city may enforce the collection of the full amount due in the same manner as provided in O.C.G.A. § 48-5-358 and other applicable tax statutes; provided, however, this procedure shall be subject to the right of redemption by any person having any right, title or interest in or lien upon the property, all as provided by O.C.G.A. § 48-4-40 et seq. 
                  (h)  Nothing contained in this section shall prevent or prohibit the municipal court from punishing by its contempt powers any owner or parties in interest that willfully fail or refuse to comply with an order entered in accordance with this article.

                  (a)  In any case where the owner, agent, or tenant fails to abate the nuisance in the time specified, or where the owner, agent or tenant cannot be served with notice, or where the nature of the nuisance is such, in the opinion of the judge, that it must be immediately abated, the judge may issue an order to the chief of police directing the nuisance to be abated. The chief of police, in such case, shall keep a record of the expenses and cost of abating same, and the costs shall be billed against the owner, agent or tenant for collection as for city revenues generally and shall become a lien on the property of such persons. 
                  (b)  Other city departments shall assist the chief of police as is necessary in abating nuisances hereunder.

                  Sec. 34-138. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control, using best management practices. 
                  (a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the article and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of this section. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit. 
                  (b)  Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
                  (1)  Best management practices as set forth in Section IV B. and C. of this article shall be required for all land-disturbing activities.

As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
                  (2)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This subsection shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a Local Issuing Authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land-disturbing activities occur. 
                  (5)  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsections (c)(15) and (16), in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
                  (c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  (7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in runoff water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this subsection, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments onsite or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection (b)(2) of this section; 
                  (15)  Except as provided in subsection (16) of this section, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the groundwater table year round; for which groundwater is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow, unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to Part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this subsection. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
                  (i)  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
                  (ii)  Stream crossings for sewer lines. 
                  (16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
                  (i)  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
                  (ii)  Stream crossings for sewer lines. 
                  (d)  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. 
                  (e)  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
                  (Ord. No. 10(01)-2009, § IV, 10-20-2009) 
                  Sec. 34-139. - Application/permit process. 
                  (a)  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
                  (b)  Application requirements. 
                  (1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the city without first obtaining a permit from the county community services department to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
                  (2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the county community services department and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection (c) of this section. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of subsections 34-138(b) and (c) of this article will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by two copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
                  (3)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the Division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  (4)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by subsections 34-138(c)(15) and (16) has been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per subsection (b)(6) [of this section], have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
                  (5)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this article section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
                  (6)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  (c)  Plan requirements. 
                  (1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in subsections 34-138(b) and (c) of this article, or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this article. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and storm water management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land-disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
                  (2)  Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
                  (d)  Permits. 
                  (1)  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
                  (2)  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this article, any variances required by subsections 34-138(c)(15) and (16) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per subsection (b)(6) [of this section] are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
                  (3)  Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this article, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
                  (4)  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
                  (5)  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this article. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
                  (6)  The LIA may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(f)(1). 
                  (Ord. No. 10(01)-2009, § V, 10-20-2009) 
                  Sec. 34-140. - Inspection and enforcement. 
                  (a)  The county community services department will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article. 
                  (b)  The local issuing authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within 12 months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975. 
                  (c)  The county community services department shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this article, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities. 
                  (d)  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the Local Issuing Authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
                  (e)  The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). The district or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
                  (f)  The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within 90 days after notification by the division, the division shall revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority.

                  Sec. 34-141. - Penalties and incentives. 
                  (a)  Failure to obtain a permit for land-disturbing activity. If any person commences any land-disturbing activity requiring a land-disturbing permit as prescribed in this article without first obtaining said permit, the person shall be subject to revocation of his business license, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a business and associated work activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. 
                  (b)  Stop-work orders. 
                  (1)  For the first and second violations of the provisions of this article, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have five days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within five days, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a stop-work order requiring that land-disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided, however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land-disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order in lieu of a warning. 
                  (2)  For a third and each subsequent violation, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order. 
                  (3)  All stop-work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. 
                  (4)  When a violation in the form of taking action without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer, or significant amounts of sediment, as determined by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee, have been or are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained, a stop work order shall be issued by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee. All such stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop work orders shall apply to all land-disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls. 
                  (c)  Bond forfeiture. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities has failed to comply with the approved plan, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to have forfeited his performance bond, if required to post one under the provisions of subsection 34-139(b)(6). The local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. 
                  (d)  Monetary penalties. 
                  (1)  Any person who violates any provisions of this article, or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant to this article, or who negligently or intentionally fails or refuses to comply with any final or emergency order of the director issued as provided in this article shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 per day. For the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this article, notwithstanding any provisions in any city Charter to the contrary, municipal courts shall be authorized to impose penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Notwithstanding any limitation of law as to penalties which can be assessed for violations of county ordinances, any magistrate court or any other court of competent jurisdiction trying cases brought as violations of this article under county ordinances approved under this article shall be authorized to impose penalties for such violations not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Each day during which violation or failure or refusal to comply continues shall be a separate violation.

                  Editor's note— Ord. No. 99-1, §§ 1—10, adopted February 2, 1999, did not specifically amend the Code; hence, inclusion as §§ 34-235—34-244 was at the discretion of the editor. 

                  Sec. 34-235. - Findings and purpose. 
                  (a)  Findings of fact. The wetlands within the city are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion, and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife, and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; open space; and recreational opportunities. In addition, wetlands affect the economic well-being of many communities within the state. 
                  Nationally, a considerable number of these important natural resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution, and other acts. Piecemeal or cumulative losses will, over time, destroy additional wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare. 
                  The state department of natural resources and the state department of community affairs have determined that each local government with classified wetlands located in its jurisdiction must adopt a wetlands protection ordinance. 
                  It is therefore necessary for the city to ensure maximum protection for wetlands by discouraging development activities in wetlands that may adversely affect wetlands. 
                  (b)  Purpose. The purposes of this article are to promote wise use of wetlands and protect wetlands, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational, and aesthetic values. Activities which may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practicable as determined by a permitting process. The objective of this article is to protect wetlands from alterations which will significantly affect or reduce their primary functions for water quality, floodplain and erosion control, groundwater recharge, aesthetic nature, and wildlife areas and to comply with the requirements of state law related to wetland protection. 
                  (Ord. No. 99-1, § 1(1.1), (1.2), 2-2-1999) 
                  Sec. 34-236. - Wetland protection district. 
                  (a)  Wetland protection district. This article shall apply to all wetlands within the wetland protection district as defined herein and located within the jurisdiction of the city. The generalized wetland map, adopted as part of this article, shows the general location of wetlands and of the wetland protection district and shall be consulted by persons contemplating activities in or near wetlands before engaging in a regulated activity. The generalized wetland map, together with all explanatory matter thereon and attached thereto, is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this article. The generalized wetland map shall be on file in the office of the county zoning administrator. 
                  (b)  Wetland protection district boundaries. The generalized wetlands map is a general reference document and wetland boundaries indicated on the map are approximations. The purpose of the generalized wetland map is to alert developers/landowners if they are within proximity to a wetland, which means that there is a high likelihood of the presence of a jurisdictional wetland and a need for the developer/landowner to seek U.S. Army Corps of Engineers guidance as to whether a Section 404 Permit will be required prior to any activity. The generalized wetland map does not necessarily represent the exact boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the jurisdiction of the city and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this article does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements. 
                  (Ord. No. 99-1, § 2(2.1), (2.2,) 2-2-1999) 
                  Sec. 34-237. - Local development permits. 
                  (a)  Local development permit requirements. No regulated activity will be allowed within the wetland protection district without written permission from the city or its designee in the form of a local development permit. Issuance of a local development permit is contingent on full compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable regulations. All activities that are not exempted in subsection (b) below, or by other local development ordinances, shall be prohibited without prior issuance of a local development permit. If the area proposed for development is located within 50 feet of the wetland protection district boundary, as determined from the generalized wetland map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required. If the Corps of Engineers determines that wetlands are present and that a Section 404 Permit or letter of permission is required, a local development permit will be issued only following issuance of the Section 404 Permit or letter of permission. 
                  (b)  Permissible uses (use as a right). The following uses shall be allowed as a right within the wetland protection district to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining, or dredging except as provided herein. 
                  (1)  Operations conducted during normal silvicultural activities, including minor dredge and fill associated with road construction, harvesting, and reforestation practices provided they meet the performance standards and road construction best management practices required under section 404 of the Clean Water Act. 
                  (2)  Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish, and other wildlife, provided they do not affect waters of Georgia or of the United States in such a way that would require an individual 404 Permit. 
                  (3)  Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding, and canoeing. 
                  (4)  Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the state forestry commission. 
                  (5)  The cultivation of agricultural crops. Agricultural activities shall be subject to best management practices approved by the state department of agriculture. 
                  (6)  The pasturing of livestock provided that riparian wetlands are protected, that soil profiles are not disturbed and that approved best management practices are followed. 
                  (7)  Education, scientific research, and nature trails. 
                  (8)  Temporary emergency permit. A temporary emergency permit can be issued by the city or its designee for the following reasons: 
                  *  Maintenance or repair of lawfully located roads or structures and of facilities used in the service of the public to provide transportation, electric, gas, water, telephone, telegraph, telecommunication or other services, provided that such roads, structures, or facilities are not materially changed or enlarged and that, prior to the commencement of work, written notice has been given to the city or its designee and provided that the work is conducted using best management practices to ensure that flow and circulation patterns, and chemical and biological characteristics of the wetland, are not impaired and that any adverse effect on the aquatic environment will be minimized. 
                  *  Temporary water level stabilization measures associated with silvicultural operations, provided that they are necessary to alleviate abnormally wet or dry conditions that would have an adverse impact on the conduct of silvicultural activities if not corrected. 
                  *  Limited ditching, tilling, dredging, excavating, or filling done solely for the purpose of maintaining or repairing existing drainage systems necessary for the cultivation of agricultural crops, provided that the maintenance or repair activity does not result in the impairment, alteration, or loss of wetlands not previously subject to agricultural and silvicultural use under the terms and provisions of subsection (b). 
                  *  Limited excavating and filling necessary for the repair and maintenance of piers, walkways, nature trails, observation decks, wildlife management shelters, boathouses, or other similar water-related structures, provided that they are built on pilings to allow unobstructed flow of water and preserve the natural contour of the wetland. 
                  (c)  Site plans. Applications for a development permit within the generalized wetland protection district shall include a site plan, drawn at a scale of one inch equals 50 feet (the city may approve a different scale where necessary to clearly provide the required information) with the following information: 
                  (1)  A map of all planned excavation and fill, including calculations of the volume of cut and fill involved, and cross-sectional drawings showing existing and proposed grades. Elevations, horizontal scale, and vertical scale must be shown on the cross-sectional drawings. 
                  (2)  Location, dimensions and area of all impervious surfaces, both existing and proposed, on the site and adjacent to the site for a distance of 200 feet. 
                  (3)  The orientation and distance from the boundaries of the proposed site to the nearest bank of an affected perennial stream or water body. 
                  (4)  Elevations of the site and adjacent lands within 200 feet of the site at contour intervals of no greater than two feet. 
                  (5)  Location and detailed design of any spill and leak collection systems designed for the purpose of containing accidentally released hazardous or toxic materials. 
                  (6)  All proposed temporary disruptions or diversions of local hydrology. 
                  (d)  Activities to comply with site plan. All development activities or site work conducted after approval of the site plan shall conform with the specifications of said site plan. The site plan may be amended only with the approval of the city or its designee. The city may require a bond up to the larger of $5,000.00 or $1,000.00 per acre of project area and with surety and conditions sufficient to secure compliance with the conditions and limitations set forth in the permit. The particular amount and conditions of the bond shall be consistent with the purposes of this article. In the event of a breach of condition of any such bond, the city or its designee may collect such bond or institute an action in a court of competent jurisdiction upon such bond and prosecute the same to judgment and execution. 
                  (e)  Filing fee. At the time of the application, the applicant shall pay a filing fee specified by the city or its designee. Filing fees up to the larger of $500.00 or $100.00 per acre may be required to evaluate the application. This fee may be used to retain expert consultants who will provide services pertaining to functional assessment and mitigation measures as deemed necessary by the city or its designee. In any case, the following fees shall not be less than the amount necessary for evaluation of the application in a manner consistent with the intent of this article. 
                  (f)  Enforcement authority. The county zoning and inspection department is hereby established as the administrator of this article. 
                  (g)  Review procedures. The application shall be made to the county zoning and inspection department and will be reviewed within 60 days or in accordance with established review procedures for the type of development being considered, whichever is greater. The review period shall include the preparation of findings (approval or disapproval) by the county zoning and inspection department. The applicant will receive written notification of the findings thereof. If the review process is not completed within the time period specified herein, the application is considered to be approved for the purposes of this article. 
                  (h)  Appeals. Decisions on permit application made by the county zoning and inspection department may be appealed to the city council. The appeal must be made within ten days of the decision rendered by the county zoning and inspection department. A public hearing shall be held for appeals. Public announcement of the hearing may be printed in local newspapers at least 15 but no more than 45 days prior to the hearing. Any person may offer testimony at the hearing. The decision of the city council may be appealed to a court of competent jurisdiction, as discussed in section 34-240. 
                  (i)  Duration of permit validity. 
                  (1)  If construction described in the development permit has not commenced within 12 months from the date of issuance, the permit shall expire.

Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid.

The tax commissioner shall remit the amount collected to the governing authority of the city.

                  (m)  Nothing in this article shall be construed to impair or limit in any way the power of the city to define and declare nuisances and to cause their removal or abatement by summary proceedings or otherwise.

                  Sec. 38-31. - Authorization. 
                  Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a) have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the city council does ordain as follows.

                  Sec. 31-32. - Findings of fact. 
                  (a)  The flood hazard areas of Jackson, Georgia are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (b)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
                  (Ord. No. 09(07)-02, art. 1, § B, 7-21-2009) 
                  Sec. 38-33. - Statement of purpose. 
                  It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
                  (4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and 
                  (5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.

                  Sec. 38-34. - Objectives. 
                  The objectives of this article are: 
                  (1)  To protect human life and health; 
                  (2)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
                  (3)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; 
                  (4)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
                  (5)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
                  (6)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; and 
                  (7)  To insure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

                  The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in its Flood Insurance Study (FIS), dated August 18, 2009, with accompanying maps and other supporting data and any revision thereto, are adopted by reference and declared a part of this article. 
                  For those land areas acquired by a municipality through annexation, the current effective FIS dated August 18, 2009, with accompanying maps and other supporting data and any revision thereto, for Butts County, are hereby adopted by reference. 
                  Areas of special flood hazard may also include those areas known to have flooded historically or defined through standard engineering analysis by governmental agencies or private parties but not yet incorporated in a FIS (no known flood hazards).

                  (1)  Considered as minimum requirements;

                  Sec. 38-41. - Warning and disclaimer of liability. 
                  The degree of flood protection required by this article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur; flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This article does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This article shall not create liability on the part of city or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this article or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.

                  Failure to comply with the provisions of this article or with any of its requirements, including conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants of variance or special exceptions, shall constitute a violation. Any person who violates this article or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than $1,000.00 or imprisoned for not more than 180 days, or both, and in addition, shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Each day such violation continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the city from taking such other lawful actions as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.

                  Sec. 38-43. - Variance procedures. 
                  (a)  The city council shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this article. 
                  (b)  The city council shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the county community services director in the enforcement or administration of this article. 
                  (c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the city council may appeal such decision to the Superior Court of Butts County, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1. 
                  (d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this section are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (g)  In reviewing such requests, the city council shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article. 
                  (h)  Conditions for variances: 
                  (1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
                  b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  (2)  The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (4)  The county community services director shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (i)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

                  Area of special flood hazard is the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. In the absence of official designation by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, areas of special flood hazard shall be those designated by the local community and referenced in section 38-36. 
                  Base flood means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
                  Base flood elevation (BFE) means the elevation shown on the flood insurance rate map for zones AE, AH, A1—A30, AR, AR/A, AR/AE, AR/A1—A30, AR/AH, AR/AO, V1—V30, and VE that indicates the water surface elevation resulting from a flood that has a one percent chance of equaling or exceeding that level in any given year. 
                  Basement means that portion of a building having its floor sub-grade (below ground level) on all sides. 
                  Building means any structure built for support, shelter, or enclosure for any occupancy or storage. 
                  Critical facility means any public or private facility, which, if flooded, would create an added dimension to the disaster or would increase the hazard to life and health. Critical facilities include: 
                  (1)  Structures or facilities that produce, use, or store highly volatile, flammable, explosive, toxic, or water-reactive materials; 
                  (2)  Hospitals and nursing homes, and housing for the elderly, which are likely to contain occupants who may not be sufficiently mobile to avoid the loss of life or injury during flood and storm events;

                  (4)  Generating plants, and other principal points of utility lines. 
                  Development means any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate, including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavating, drilling operations, and storage of materials or equipment. 
                  Elevated building means a non-basement building built to have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area elevated above the ground level by means of fill, solid foundation perimeter walls, pilings, columns, piers, or shear walls adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a base flood event. 
                  Existing construction means, for the purposes of determining rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced before September 29, 1986. 
                  Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before February 18, 1985. 
                  Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed, including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads.

                  Flood insurance study means the official report by the Federal Insurance Administration evaluating flood hazards and containing flood profiles and water surface elevations of the base flood. 
                  Floodplain means any land area susceptible to flooding. 
                  Flood proofing means any combination of structural and non-structural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures, which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents. 
                  Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
                  Freeboard means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of floodplain management. "Freeboard" tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed. 
                  Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, adjacent to the proposed foundation of a building. 
                  Historic structure means any structure that is:

                  a.  By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior; or 
                  b.  Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs. 
                  Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement. An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage, in an area other than a basement, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of other provisions of this code. 
                  Manufactured home means a building, transportable in one or more sections, built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and similar transportable structures placed on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer and intended to be improved property. 
                  Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.

For purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are referenced. 
                  National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) as corrected in 1929 is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
                  New construction means, for the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced after September 29, 1986 and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced after February 18, 1985 and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
                  New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed after February 18, 1985. 
                  North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) has replaced the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 in existing and future FEMA Flood Modernization Maps. 
                  Recreational vehicle means a vehicle which is: 
                  (1)  Built on a single chassis;

                  (4)  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
                  Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. (Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure.) ( Note: Accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance requirements.) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
                  Subdivision means the division of a single lot into two or more lots for the purpose of sale or development. 
                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
                  Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the "start of construction" of the improvement. ( Note: The market value of the structure should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring.) This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
                  For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include (1) those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project, or (2) any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure". 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this article, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article. 
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  DIVISION 3. - PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

                  Sec. 38-61. - General standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure; 
                  (2)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage; 
                  (3)  New construction or substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
                  (4)  Elevated buildings. All new construction or substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater. 
                  a.  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
                  1.  Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
                  2.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and 
                  3.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both directions. 
                  b.  So as not to violate the "lowest floor" criteria of this article, the unfinished or flood resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area; and 
                  c.  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms. 
                  (5)  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
                  (6)  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces. 
                  (7)  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system. 
                  (8)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters. 
                  (9)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding; and 
                  (10)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure, which is not compliant with the provisions of this chapter, shall be undertaken only if the non-conformity is not furthered, extended or replaced. 
                  (Ord. No. 09(07)-02, art. 4, § A, 7-21-2009) 
                  Sec. 38-62. - Specific standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and/or substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and/or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 38-61(4), "Elevated buildings." 
                  a.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  (2)  Non-residential construction. New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1—30, AE, or AH zones, may be flood-proofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in section 38-53(6). 
                  (3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
                  a.  All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on: (1) individual lots or parcels, (2) in new and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, (3) in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or (4) on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  b.  Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
                  (i)  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or 
                  (ii)  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
                  c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (See section 38-61(6) above.) 
                  d.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
                  (i)  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; 
                  (ii)  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions); or 
                  (iii)  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "new construction", including the anchoring and elevation requirements of section 38-62(3)a—c, above. 
                  (4)  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 38-36 are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
                  b.  Only if section 38-62(4)a above is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of division 3.

                  (a)  A person commits the offense of loitering or prowling when he is in a place at a time or in a manner not usual for law-abiding individuals under circumstances that warrant a justifiable and reasonable alarm or immediate concern for the safety of persons or property in the vicinity. 
                  (b)  Among the circumstances which may be considered in determining whether alarm is warranted is the fact that the person takes flight upon the appearance of a law enforcement officer, refuses to identify himself or manifestly endeavors to conceal himself or any object. Unless flight by the person or other circumstances make it impracticable, a law enforcement officer shall, prior to any arrest for an offense under this article, afford the person an opportunity to dispel any alarm or immediate concern which would otherwise be warranted by requesting the person to identify himself and explain his presence and conduct. No person shall be convicted of an offense under this article if the law enforcement officer failed to comply with the foregoing procedure or if it appears at trial that the explanation given by the person was true and would have dispelled the alarm or immediate concern.

                  Sec. 46-33. - Duties and responsibilities of real estate owners or occupants concerning collection. 
                  Owners of real estate or occupants of real estate within the city limits shall have the following duties and responsibilities concerning waste collection: 
                  (1)  Placement at curbside; removal; violation constitutes littering; exceptions. A garbage curbside collection franchisee shall notify its customers of the time that it will empty carts or containers. It will be the customer's responsibility to place a cart at curbside prior to collection and to remove the cart from curbside after collection. If any residential cart is left at curbside or upon the city's right-of-way for more than 48 hours following the day of cart trash collection by the franchisee, such act shall be an act of littering. Any owner or occupant of real estate cited for a violation of this section may show as a defense extenuating circumstances which make strict enforcement unreasonable, such as extreme weather conditions, absence from the city for a reasonable period of time, or temporary physical disability. Persons with long-term physical disability are required to contract with a franchisee for backdoor collection, or contract privately for moving the cart. 
                  (2)  Bulky waste, construction debris and hazardous waste; separate contract required; accumulations constitute littering. Those items described in section 46-32 as bulky waste, construction debris, hazardous waste and dead animals are items which the city will not collect, and a waste disposal franchisee is not required to collect for the monthly fee automatically added to city utility bills or the monthly fee billed directly by the franchisee. Any owner or occupant of premises within the city that has such waste to dispose of must either contract directly with a franchisee or privately remove such waste. If any such waste is allowed to accumulate on private premises or allowed to remain at curbside for a period of ten days, such accumulation shall be an act of littering. 
                  (3)  Accumulation of solid waste constitutes littering. Each city utility customer not selecting the curbside waste collection service directly from the city or the city's franchisee and not paying a monthly fee either directly to the city or to the city's franchisee, who allows any type of solid waste to accumulate on private premises or allows it to remain at curbside for a period of ten days, shall be guilty of an act of littering. 
                  (4)  Citation for littering; penalty for violation of section. When any act of littering is committed in violation of this article, a citation may be issued to any owner of the premises, whether or not the owner is in actual possession of the premises, or any occupant of the premises who is either a head of household or a manager or officer of a business. Separate citations for littering may be issued to as many persons as are deemed responsible by virtue of this article. Such citations shall be tried before the municipal court of the city. Violators of this section shall, upon conviction, be punished as provided in section 1-11

                  (b)  If persons assemble in such numbers as to tend to intimidate pickets pursuing their lawful objective through numbers alone or through use of inflammatory words, then the police may direct the dispersal of such persons so assembled, and may arrest any person who fails to absent himself from the place of such assemblage when so directed by the police. No person so assembled shall fail to absent himself from such place or to cease and desist from such course of conduct after having been directed by the police to do so.

                  The city clerk is authorized to issue permits after approval by city council as required by the provisions of this article, and in the issuance thereof he shall require: 
                  (1)  If the proposed event involves any aspect of any state or federal highway, any application for a permit must first be approved by the appropriate state or federal authority prior to any action being taken by the city. A written application for permit shall be filed with the city clerk for consideration from city council at least one week before the next scheduled council meeting. The application shall be on a form prescribed by the city clerk. The application shall be signed by the applicant and shall show the proposed time, place, purpose of the event.

An application for any event shall disclose particulars as to time and location of the event, use of musical instruments or other sound production devices, use of voice amplification, presence of animals and estimated size of gathering. The purpose of applications and permits for assemblies is to protect the public against unreasonable traffic, noise and health problems; there is no prohibition against participation of minors in assemblies, nor is there any restriction as to number of participants, so long as the location and time of the assembly will reasonably accommodate the number of participants within the area in which the assembly takes place. 
                  (2)  The application for any event permit shall specify whether or not any minor child will be permitted to participate. The city clerk shall pass upon whether or not such minor may participate, and shall base such determination upon whether or not the nature or time or place of the particular activity will be detrimental to or endanger the health, safety or welfare of such minor child, or will interfere with such minor child's education. 
                  (3)  The permit will specify what sound producing devices, if any, will be allowed and shall specify what animals, if any, will be allowed. 
                  (4)  The application shall specify and designate the person in charge of the activity, and his name shall appear in the permit.

                  No permit shall be issued for any activity regulated by this article which conflicts with any previously-permitted activity by covering or crossing any part of substantially the same route during substantially the same timeframe as allotted to the previously-permitted activity, except that two or more picket lines may demonstrate as provided in section 50-68, pertaining to counter-picketing.

                  (2)  The activity will not interfere with the right of property owners in the area to enjoy peaceful and lawful occupancy and use of their property; and 
                  (3)  The activity can be conducted while allowing reasonable vehicular and pedestrian ingress and egress throughout the affected area and will not prevent normal police and fire protection to the public and will not be likely to cause injury to persons or property or to provoke disorderly conduct or to create a public disturbance of such scale or nature as to violate any of the requisites of this article, any other ordinance of the city or any state or federal law.

                  The owner and occupant of each lot whereon is located either a residence, a commercial or industrial building or other structure designed for human use shall display the street number of the structure pursuant to the following rules: 
                  (1)  The street number will be displayed by use of reflective material which can be easily seen at night when illuminated by a light shone from the public right-of-way. 
                  (2)  The individual numbers shall be of a size that will make them easily distinguishable by the eye from the public right-of-way, and each number shall be no less than three inches tall and three inches wide. 
                  (3)  On those city lots where the building is set back from the right-of-way and accessed by a driveway leading from the public right-of-way, the street number shall be displayed at the point nearest the public right-of-way beside the main drive leading from the city street, which is the official address of the lot, facing in the direction of the street. 
                  (4)  On those lots where the building is at or very near the right-of-way boundary, the street number shall be displayed either on the side of the building or directly in front of the building facing the street which is the official address of the lot. 
                  (5)  Display of the street number shall be acceptable, if displayed on a mailbox or at ground level or on a post, if the street number is displayed upon or in front of the lot at curbside and the display otherwise satisfies the requirements of this article as to size, visibility, direction and reflective capability. 
                  (Ord. No. 96-18, art. I(B), 5-21-1996; Ord. No. 99-3, § 1, 5-4-1999) 
                  Sec. 50-134. - Enforcement. 
                  The department of public works shall periodically inspect to determine whether street numbers are being displayed in compliance with this article. If a lot is found whereon the correct street number is not being displayed in the correct manner, the department of public works may take the following action: 
                  (1)  Notice of noncompliance. The superintendent of the department of public works or any employee of the department or any police officer acting upon the authority of the superintendent shall issue a written notice, which shall contain the date of the notice, the correct street address and a description of the deficiency or other noncompliance observed. One copy of such notice shall be either delivered to the occupant at the lot or attached to the building, one copy will be mailed to the owner of record as per the records of the county taxing authority, one copy will be filed with the city clerk and one copy will be kept as part of the records of the department of public works. The notice shall contain an order that the correct street number be properly displayed within ten days from the date of the notice. 
                  (2)  Penalty. Failure to correctly display the street number within ten days after the date of the notice shall constitute a violation of this article and shall, upon conviction, subject both the owner and occupant to punishment as provided in section 1-11. 
                  (3)  Assessment. If neither the owner nor the occupant comply with the requirement that the street number be properly displayed within ten days following the issuance of a notice as described in subsection (1) of this section, the superintendent of the department of public works may cause the street number to be properly displayed at the expense of the city, and the total cost of such action, including but not limited to materials, labor and reasonable costs of litigation, including attorney's fees, shall be a lien upon the real estate upon which such cost was incurred. Such lien shall attach to the real property upon the filing of an itemized statement of the total sum of the cost by the city clerk in the office of the city clerk on a lien docket maintained for such purposes. Thereafter the lien may be collected by adding same to the cost of any city license fee, city utility bill or other city assessment owed by either the owner or the occupant within a period of seven years after the date of filing of the lien. No deposit for city utilities may be refunded on property upon which such a lien exists, until the lien is paid in full. No city utility services may commence for property upon which such a lien exists, until the lien is paid in full. Also, the lien may be collected by direct litigation against either the owner or the occupant, filed in the name of the city, and the city would be entitled to recover not only the amount of the lien, but any cost of court or other reasonable litigation expense, including attorney's fees, necessary for the enforcement of the lien.

Upon approval of the plans and specifications by the community development director, such plans, specifications, and other required documents, together with the recommendation of the community development director, shall be submitted to the city council for final approval.

Any such owner or owners shall have the right to appeal the decision of the community development director by filing a written notice of appeal with the community development director within 30 days from the date of said notice of denial.

                  (a)  Estimate of gross receipts. If any operator fails to make a return, the city clerk shall make an estimate of the amount of the gross receipts of the operator or, as the case may be, of the amount of the total rentals in this city which are subject to the tax. The estimate shall be made for the period in respect to which the person failed to make the return and shall be based upon any information which is or may come into the possession of the clerk. Upon the basis of this estimate, the clerk shall compute and determine the amount required to be paid the city, adding to the sum thus determined a penalty equal to 15 percent of such amount.

When it is determined by a return filed, or by the clerk having made a determination under the provisions of section 58-42 or section 56-43, that tax is due and payable to the city under the provisions of this article, the city may, at any time within three years after determination that such tax is due and payable, bring an action in the courts of this state, of any other state, or of the United States, in the name of the city, to collect the amount of tax payable to the city, together with interest thereon and penalties, court costs, attorney's fees and other legal fees incident thereto. The bringing of such an action shall not be a prerequisite for the issuance of a fi. fa. under the provisions of subsection (d) of this section. 
                  (b)  Duty of successors or assignees of operator to withhold tax from purchase money. If any operator liable for any amount of tax under this article sells or transfers his business, his successors or assigns shall withhold a sufficient amount of the purchase price of the business to cover such amount of tax, interest thereon, and penalties, and pay such sum over to the city, unless the operator liable for such tax delivers to such purchaser or transferee, as the case may be, at the time of such sale or transfer, a certificate from the clerk showing that all tax returns required of such operator have been filed and all taxes shown as being payable on such returns have been paid in full. 
                  (c)  Liability for failure to withhold; time to enforce successor's liability. If the purchaser or transferee of a business fails to withhold the required amount of the purchase price, he shall be personally liable for the payment of the amount required to be withheld by him to the extent of the purchase price, valued in money. The time within which the obligation of a successor may be enforced shall start to run at the time the operator sells or transfers his business, or at the time that the determination against the operator becomes final, whichever event occurs later. 
                  (d)  Issuance of fi. fa. The clerk is hereby authorized to issue a fi. fa. for execution and levy to satisfy the amount of any tax, penalty or interest due but not paid under the provisions of this article.

                  Sec. 58-45. - Agents for receiving notices. 
                  When registering pursuant to section 58-37, each operator shall appoint, in writing, an agent to receive for the operator any notice required to be given to the operator under the provisions of this article, stating the full name, street address, mailing address and telephone number of such agent. Such agent shall be either an individual resident of the city or an employee of the operator who regularly works at the operator's place of business on a daily basis, and the appointment of the agent must be accompanied by the written consent of such agent to serve as agent for the operator. Such agent may be changed from time to time by written appointment of, and consent of, a successor agent. The operator is required to have such an agent at all times and should an agent cease to be a resident of the city or an employee regularly working at the operator's place of business in the city, as the case may be, the operator shall immediately file a written appointment of a new agent and such agent's consent to serve as such with the clerk. Any agent so appointed by an operator shall be authorized to receive for and on behalf of the operator any notice required to be given to the operator by the provisions of this article. Delivery of any such notice to such agent, in person or by mail, shall be sufficient to meet the requirements of this article, and such notice shall be binding on the operator. This method of giving notice to operators is supplementary and cumulative of the other methods of giving notice set forth in this article.

                  Editor's note— Ord. No. 98-9, §§ I—V, adopted November 3, 1998, did not specifically amend the Code; hence, inclusion as §§ 62-136—62-141 was at the discretion of the editor. 

                  Sec. 62-136. - Purpose. 
                  The purpose of this article is to establish policies and procedures concerning the use of the public rights-of-way of the city by private individuals, businesses, and property owners, to establish conditions for the issuance of permits for some encroachments, to prohibit encroachments without permits, to establish penalties, and to establish rules regarding awnings. 
                  (Ord. No. 98-9, 11-3-1998) 
                  Sec. 62-137. - Definitions. 
                  For purposes of this article, the following terms shall have the meaning hereafter ascribed thereto: 
                  Encroachment. The term "encroachment" shall include any purpresture or other trespass upon the public right-of-way either of a temporary or a permanent nature. The term would include but not be limited to any awning, sign, decoration, vegetation, object or machine attached to or extending from private property and extending upon, over or under the surface of any portion of the public right-of-way. The term shall include any landscaping, structure or device which has the effect of gathering rainwater or surface water and diverting it upon or under the public right-of-way in greater quantities than would be upon or under the public right-of-way if such artificial water diversion did not exist. 
                  Right-of-way. The term "right-of-way" shall include the public streets, sidewalks, alleyways, approaches, curbs, and all other means of public access owned by the city or acquired by the public in general within the city, either by deed, lease, adverse possession, prescription, or contract. 
                  Temporary encroachment. The term "temporary encroachment" shall apply only to objects, such as displays or machines, expressly excluding awnings and signs, which are placed upon the public right-of-way in conjunction with property, a business location, school, religious institution, or other lawful use of real estate adjacent to the public right-of-way. Such encroachments as described above which are placed upon the public right-of-way during normal business hours and removed from the right-of-way during all other times shall be defined as temporary encroachments. 
                  (Ord. No. 98-9, § I, 11-3-1998) 
                  Sec. 62-138. - Prohibitions. 
                  (a)  It shall be unlawful for any person to trespass upon the public right-of-way by constructing or maintaining any structure, object or condition which is an encroachment upon, over or under any part of the public right-of-way. It shall be unlawful for any person to trespass upon the public right-of-way by constructing, landscaping or maintaining any condition upon adjoining property which has the effect of gathering surface or rainwater and diverting it upon or under any part of the public right-of-way, when the artificial means employed causes such water to divert upon or under the public right-of-way in greater quantities than would exist if the structure or landscaping did not exist. All encroachments are unlawful, except for those specifically allowed by this article or permitted by the city council by the issuance of a permit pursuant to this article. 
                  (b)  Penalties. Unless allowed by this article or permitted by the city council pursuant to this article, any trespass or encroachment upon the public right-of-way as described above shall be punishable by citation and fine not to exceed $500.00, or incarceration up to six months or both. 
                  (Ord. No. 98-9, § II, 11-3-1998) 
                  Sec. 62-139. - Temporary encroachments. 
                  (a)  Temporary encroachments. Temporary encroachments, as defined in this article, do not require a special permit, so long as they are maintained under the following rules: 
                  (1)  A temporary encroachment over or upon any part of the public right-of-way may only be maintained for an encroachment which is reasonably convenient to the property, business location, school, religious institution, or other lawful use of real estate of the owner of the encroachment, which real estate is adjacent to the public right-of-way. 
                  (2)  No temporary encroachment shall be allowed which will in any way damage or impede use of or access to the public right-of-way. An encroachment will be considered to damage the public right-of-way if placement of same results in any effect upon the appearance or usability of the public right-of-way after the removal of the encroachment. An encroachment will be considered to impede the public right-of-way if it in any way alters the flow of vehicular traffic upon the public roads or alleyways or if it in any way restricts ingress and egress upon the public sidewalk so as to reduce clearance upon the sidewalk to less than 48 inches in all directions, other than toward the property owner's exterior wall, except that, in the case of an encroachment over the public right-of-way, there shall be no less than seven feet six inches of clearance between the surface of the public right-of-way and the lowest point of such encroachment. 
                  (3)  A temporary encroachment may only be maintained upon or over the public right-of-way during normal business hours in conjunction with the specific use of the adjacent property of the owner of the encroachment. The placement of any encroachment upon the public right-of-way during any time other than those specific times will be a violation of this article. All temporary encroachments must be completely removed from the public right-of-way at the close of business each day. 
                  (4)  No temporary encroachment upon the public right-of-way shall be allowed which would in any way tend to violate any other ordinance of the city, state law or regulation, or federal law or regulation, including but not limited to the city zoning ordinance, city noise ordinance, the city nuisance ordinance, fire and safety ordinances, health codes, traffic laws, and laws requiring access for persons with disabilities. 
                  (5)  All temporary encroachments shall be kept clean, orderly and in good working order. 
                  (b)  Removal. Any city police officer or other city official with the power to enforce this article shall be empowered to remove from the public right-of-way any temporary encroachment found which in any way violates this article relating to temporary encroachments. Any failure to maintain the temporary encroachment in accordance with this article shall be a violation of this article and subject to the penalties referred to in section 62-138 of this article. 
                  (Ord. No. 98-9, § III, 11-3-1998) 
                  Sec. 62-140. - Long-term encroachments. 
                  (a)  Long-term encroachment permits. It is the policy of the city council that there shall be no long-term encroachments upon the public right-of-way. Because no person, business or entity has ever acquired any right to place any encroachment upon the public right-of-way, no encroachment existing prior to the passage of this article shall have any special rights or privileges in this regard. Any person seeking to place any encroachment above, upon or under any part of the public right-of-way, which encroachment is not a temporary encroachment as defined in this article, shall be subject to the following rules: 
                  (1)  Application for a permit shall be made directly to the city council. Long-term encroachment permits shall last from January 1 until December 31 of the year for which they are issued. There shall be no permit issued which shall last longer than December 31 of the year in which it is issued. The city council may issue a long-term encroachment permit for a shorter period of time. 
                  (2)  A permit shall only allow an encroachment which will in no way damage or impede use of or access to the public right-of-way. An encroachment will be considered to damage the public right-of-way if placement of same results in any effect upon the appearance or usability of the public right-of-way after the removal of the encroachment. An encroachment will be considered to impede the public right-of-way if it in any way alters the flow of vehicular traffic upon the public roads or alleyways or if it in any way restricts ingress and egress upon the public sidewalk so as to reduce clearance upon the sidewalk to less than 48 inches in all directions, other than toward the property owner's exterior wall, except that in the case of an encroachment over the public right-of-way, there shall be no less than seven feet six inches of clearance between the surface of the public right-of-way and the lowest point of such encroachment. 
                  (3)  The allowance of a permit for a long-term encroachment will not grant to the owner of the encroachment or the property upon which or from which the encroachment is permitted any prescriptive or other rights extending beyond December 31 of the year in which the permit is issued. 
                  (4)  A person seeking a long-term encroachment permit shall apply in writing at the office of the city clerk and pay an application fee, to be established by the city council. The application fee shall include an administrative fee and the total costs of advertisement. The application shall include the inclusive dates and the location of the encroachment to be permitted and a specific description of the nature of the encroachment. The application shall include a drawing of the affected right-of-way showing the proposed location of the encroachment. The chief of police or other authorized agent of the city shall inspect the proposed location and the application and give a report to the city clerk. The city clerk will advertise the application and the time and date of the hearing before the city council for one week. The matter will be heard before the city council at the next regularly scheduled meeting held at least ten days after the appearance of the advertisement in the newspaper. At the hearing, the applicant will be allowed to speak first, the chief of police or other authorized agent who did the investigation will either speak or present a written report next, and then the city council will hear comments from the public as time permits. The city council shall either issue a permit or a written denial within three business days after the conclusion of the hearing, and the decision of the city council will be final. 
                  (4)  An applicant must pay an administrative fee, which will include all of the costs of advertising, at the time of making the application. If the permit is issued, the permittee must pay an annual fee for the permit prior to its issuance. The amount of the annual permit fee shall be established from year to year by the city council, prior to the issuance of any permits for that year. 
                  (5)  No long-term encroachment upon the public right-of-way shall be allowed which would in any way tend to violate any other ordinance of the city, state law or regulation, or federal law or regulation, including but not limited to the city zoning ordinance, city noise ordinance, the city nuisance ordinance, fire and safety ordinances, health codes, traffic laws, and laws requiring access for persons with disabilities. 
                  (6)  All permitted encroachments shall be maintained in good working order with an orderly and clean appearance. Permitted encroachments must be maintained so as not to violate any of the restrictions specifically stated in the permit, the restrictions of this article, or the restrictions of any local, state or federal law as now existing or hereafter enacted. Failure to maintain a permitted encroachment in accordance with this provision and all other provisions of this article shall be a violation of this article, subject to citation and fine and incarceration, as established in this article. Any permitted encroachment shall be subject to inspection at any time by any officer empowered to enforce this article or directed by the city council to perform such inspections. 
                  (b)  Revocation of permit. Any long-term encroachment permit may be revoked by majority vote of the city council, pursuant to notice and hearing as stated herein. If the city council wishes to consider revocation of such permit it shall first deliver to the business address associated with the encroachment a written notice of hearing stating the reason for the proposed revocation and setting a specific time and date for the hearing. Ten days' written notice to the permittee shall be granted, but notice shall be considered delivered when delivered to the business address associated with the permitted encroachment. At the hearing, the city council shall consider whatever testimony or evidence that it considers relevant and shall offer the permittee an opportunity to be heard. At the conclusion of the hearing, the council shall decide whether or not to revoke the permit. If a permit is revoked, the encroachment will be removed immediately either by the owner or the city and a prorated portion of the annual fee shall be refunded to the permittee, after payment of all costs incurred by the city in removing and disposing of the encroachment, if the city actually removes and disposes of the encroachment.

                  Sec. 62-141. - Awnings. 
                  The following provisions apply to all awnings which extend over any portion of any public right-of-way. An awning which is attached to a building adjacent to the public sidewalk, which awning extends over any portion of the public sidewalk, may be allowed as a long-term encroachment by the city council, without advertisement and without the payment of an annual fee under the following conditions: 
                  (1)  Style. Awnings shall be traditionally and historically accurate for the time period of the building. Awnings may be retractable or fixed type. Backlit awnings are not permitted. 
                  (2)  Material. Awnings shall be made of canvas, vinyl coated, or acrylic material. Modern metal awnings are not permitted. 
                  (3)  Location on building. Awnings shall be individually located within major window openings, door openings, or vestibules and they shall be designed to fit the shape and size of the specific window, door opening, or vestibule. 
                  (4)  Specifications. The following specifications relate to awnings upon buildings located upon the square and within two city blocks of the square in all directions. Any awning placed upon any building in the vicinity of a planter or tree space belonging to the city must not be placed any closer than one foot from the nearest point of the outside edge of such planter or tree space. As long as an awning is no closer to a planter or tree space than stated previously, it may extend out from the building to which it is attached up to five feet. No portion of any awning, including supports, may extend closer than seven feet and six inches toward the surface of the public right-of-way. No supports, temporary or permanent, may be placed upon the public right-of-way. Street level awnings shall have dimensions no more than five feet in height (against the building) and five feet in length (extending out from the building), so long as there is no interference with other specifications for encroachments provided for in this article and other laws and ordinances. Awnings on openings higher than the street level shall be limited to three feet of height and three feet of extension from the building.

                  Editor's note— Ord. No. 99-2, §§ I—IV, adopted May 4, 1999, did not specifically amend the Code; hence, inclusion as §§ 62-151—62-154 was at the discretion of the editor. 

                  Sec. 62-151. - Weight limit of motor vehicles. 
                  On city streets posted with weight limit warning signs, no motor vehicle may be operated with a total weight, including load and vehicle, in excess of 10,000 pounds. 
                  (Ord. No. 99-2, § I, 5-4-1999) 
                  Sec. 62-152. - Exceptions. 
                  (a)  This weight limit shall not apply to school buses or vehicles owned by the city or specifically authorized by city council to operate upon the public streets in order to provide services to the public. 
                  (b)  This prohibition does not apply to vehicles within the city limits while traveling exclusively upon state or federal highways or exclusively upon city streets with no signs notifying the public of the weight limits. 
                  (c)  This prohibition does not apply to vehicles which are within the weight limits established by state law and traveling upon the city streets for the purpose of pickup or delivery to locations within the city which are not accessible by the exclusive use of federal or state highways or city streets without weight limits. This exception to the prohibition of overweight vehicles is expressly limited to use of public streets to travel by the most direct reasonable route from a federal or state highway or city street without weight limits to the place of pickup or delivery and back to the nearest federal or state highway or city street without weight limits. Such overweight vehicles shall not remain parked or standing upon a public street with a weight limit sign for any greater period of time than is reasonably necessary in order to accomplish the pick up or delivery, which is the reason for the exception to the prohibition.

                  Sec. 62-153. - Establishment of weight limited streets and posting of streets. 
                  The city council shall from time to time establish which streets shall be designated as subject to the weight limitation by resolution. The designation will not be enforced until a street is posted. The city shall post signs notifying the driving public of this weight limit upon any city street designated by resolution. The signs shall be located upon such public streets at a point near their intersection with federal and state highways and other roadways upon which a weight limit exists which is greater than the weight limit established in this article.

                  Sec. 62-154. - Penalties. 
                  Any violation of any portion of this article shall be punished by the issuance of a citation to be tried before the municipal court. The penalties shall be as stated in section 1-11 of this Code. Nothing contained herein shall in any way limit the power and authority of the city to seek to recover damages against any party legally liable for damage caused to any city street or other property of the city by any vehicle due to the weight of the vehicle or its load.

                  Editor's note— At the discretion of the editor, §§ 1—5 of an ordinance adopted May 5, 2015 , have been docified as herein set out in Art. VIII. Said provisions did not expressly amend the Code. 

                  DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

                  Sec. 62-171. - Purpose. 
                  The intent of this article is to regulate the use of commercial vehicles within residential zoning districts other than the AR zoning district. Residential areas typically have road ways designed for the local access of passenger type vehicles. Due to size and weight, commercial vehicles often cannot easily maneuver or park on residential streets without causing damage to the road surface and hampering sight distance. Commercial vehicles, as a result of their size or appearance, including attached advertising, tools or equipment, are not in character with residential districts.

                  Sec. 62-172. - Definitions. 
                  For purposes of this article the following definitions shall apply: 
                  Commercial motor vehicle: Any self-propelled or towed motor vehicle used for commercial activities or the transport of passengers or property which, according to its manufacturer's specifications, has a gross vehicle weight or gross combination weight rating (a power unit towing another vehicle or trailer) of 10,001 pounds or more. 
                  Trailer: Shall mean any type of wheeled vehicle, regardless of the activity for which it is being used, which is designed to be pulled by a motor vehicle and is more than 20 feet in length (as measured from the tongue or hitch to the rear of the frame). 
                  Residential area: As used within this article the term "residential area" shall include all of the following zoning districts within R-30, R-20, R-l5, RM, R-P, NHC and P-R as defined by the Jackson Zoning Ordinance. 
                  ( Ord. of 5-5-2015, § 2 )

                  Sec. 62-173. - [Placement.] 
                  Commercial vehicles and trailers as defined herein shall not be parked or stored on the front or side portions of any lot in a residential area as defined herein. 
                  ( Ord. of 5-5-2015, § 3 ) 
                  Sec. 62-174. - [Exceptions.] 
                  Commercial vehicles and trailers as defined herein shall not be parked on any street or road within a residential area, as defined herein, except under the following conditions:

The city shall from time to time review the fees set forth in this section and adjust such fees as may be necessary to defray operational and maintenance costs and provide for financial capitalization including replacements and other system improvements. The city shall have the right from time to time to increase or decrease any sewer fees or sewer rates charged. Prior to any increase in rates or fees, the city shall notify the public by advertising the new rates or fees at least one time in the official newspaper of the county prior to the increase. 
                  (j)  Right of city to refuse service to those not using city water. Except as otherwise negotiated and approved, the city reserves the right to refuse sewer service to any person not using city water. 
                  (Ord. No. 94-4, §§ 1001—1012, 4-5-1994; Amend. of 6-3-1997, §§ 1—4) 
                  Sec. 66-55. - Industrial waste surcharges. 
                  (a)  Assessments for wastes exceeding authorized concentrations; enumeration. If the city authorizes any customer to discharge industrial wastes into the public sewers, such customer shall be charged and assessed a surcharge in addition to any sewer service charges if these wastes have a concentration greater than the following concentrations, which represent a relatively high strength domestic-type wastewater: 
                  (1)  A five-day, 20 degrees Celsius biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) of 250 milligrams per liter (mg/l), which is also referred to as parts per million (ppm). 
                  (2)  A suspended solids content of 250 mg/l. 
                  (3)  For wastewater discharging to a treatment plant where nitrification is required, a total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) and/or ammonia (NH3-N) of seven mg/l (separately or in combination). 
                  (4)  For wastewater discharging to a treatment plant where phosphorus treatment is required, phosphorus and phosphorus compounds (as P) of 25 mg/l. 
                  Such constituents shall be sampled and analyzed in accordance with Standard Methods or other analytical procedure approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or the regulatory agency of the state having jurisdiction. The surcharge shall be based on an average of at least three 24-hour composite samples (or composite samples during the daily discharge); or based on an average of at least six grab samples taken at different hours of operation over at least a three-day period. Where different processes are used or different products are manufactured, the highest strength discharge over a five-day period, as sampled above, shall be used as the basis of the surcharge. The amount of such surcharge, which may be charged and assessed against persons discharging industrial waste into the public sewers, shall reflect the cost incurred by the city in handling the excess of the previously listed constituents. This surcharge shall include a proportionate share of the operational and maintenance costs and replacement costs on the portions of the plant and affected sewer system and other incidental expenses (monitoring, testing and other). 
                  (b)  Formulas for calculating surcharges. When any or all of the total suspended solids, BOD, phosphorus, TKN or ammonia of the wastewater accepted for admission to the city's sewer works exceeds the values described in subsection (a) of this section of these constituents, the excess concentration in any or all, as the case may be, shall be subject to a surcharge on the amount derived in accordance with the following formula: 
                  Amount of surcharge in dollars = (pounds of excess constituent) × (prorated facility replacement cost per excess pound + prorated operational, maintenance and incidental costs per excess pound) 
                  Excess poundage shall be figured as follows: 
                  (Wastewater discharged in gallons × excess concentration in mg/l × 8.34 lbs./gallons) divided by 1,000,000. 
                  Example: 
                  1,000,000 gallons of wastewater 
                  250 mg/l excess BOD  (500 mg/l - 250 mg/l) 
                  Then: 
                  Excess poundage =  1,000,000 × 250 × 8.34  1,000,000 
                  (c)  Review of surcharge rates. The rates of surcharges shall be reviewed annually by the city in order that the factors in subsections (a) and (b) of this section may correctly represent current treatment costs and may be modified at any time. 
                  (d)  Billing; right of city to inspect, sample and test. Industrial waste surcharges provided for in this division shall be prepared and rendered with the regular water and sewer bill. The city's water and wastewater superintendent or other duly authorized employee of the city shall be permitted to enter upon any properties for the purpose of inspection, observation, measuring, sampling, and testing in accordance with the provisions of this article. 
                  (e)  Computation based on water consumption. The volume of flow used to compute industrial waste surcharges shall be based upon metered, estimated or prorated water consumption as shown in the records of meter reading maintained by the city. If a person discharging waste into the public sewer system produces evidence to the city that a significant portion of the total annual volume of water used for all purposes does not reach the public sewer system, an estimated percentage of total water consumption to be used in computing charges may be agreed upon between the city and persons discharging industrial waste into the sewer. 
                  (f)  Annual inspection; determination of character and concentration of waste; methods. The industrial waste of each person, corporation or legal entity discharging such waste into the public sewer system shall be subject to annual inspection and determination of character and concentration of such waste. Such action may be made more often as may be deemed necessary by the city. Samples shall be collected in such a manner as to be representative of the actual quality of the waste. The laboratory methods used in examination of the waste shall be those set forth in Standard Methods. 
                  (g)  Dispute over analysis; resampling and gauging procedure. If an analysis of waste, determined by the sampling and gauging of waste from a person or industry by the city, is disputed, a program of resampling and gauging, with subsequent chemical determinations, may be instituted as follows: 
                  (1)  The person or industrial user interested must submit a request for resampling and gauging of their waste to the city by letter and bind themselves to bear the expenses incurred by the city in the resampling and gauging the subsequent chemical determination of the waste. 
                  (2)  The chemist or engineer employed by the company or person responsible for the request submitted to the city must confer with the city's person in charge of gauging and sampling. They will establish the length of the rerun and the methods to be employed to determine the flow and to sample the flow. 
                  (3)  The chemist or engineer engaged by the person or industry may be present during the gauging and sampling operation and also in the laboratory during the determination of the analysis. 
                  (4)  The results of the analysis, determined from the quantity and quality of the flow, shall be considered by analysis of record.

                  Sec. 66-56. - Violation of article; penalties and fines. 
                  (a)  Violation notice; hearing. Any person found violating any provision of this article shall be served by the city with a written notice stating the nature of the violation and setting forth the time and place for the hearing on the matter. 
                  (b)  Penalty for violation of article. Any person who is found to have violated any provision of this article shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, shall be punished as provided in section 1-11, and shall further pay as restitution to the city any expense, loss or damage incurred by the city for such violation. 
                  (c)  Liability of violator to city for expenses, losses or damages. Any person violating any of the provisions of this article shall also become liable to the city for any expense, loss, or damage incurred by the city by reason of such violation. 
                  (d)  Court proceedings. All such violations shall be presented to and tried before the municipal court of the city unless otherwise specifically required by state or federal law to be tried in some other court. The court shall determine the amount of the fine or sentence that may be appropriate in the matter. The court shall also determine the amount of restitution, expenses, loss, or damages that have been incurred by the city as a result of the violation. 
                  (e)  Fines. All fines paid by the violator shall be made payable to the city. 
                  (f)  Funds collected in court determinations. All funds determined by the court and collected for restitution or reimbursement of expense, loss or damage shall be paid to the city.

                  (a)  Charges for initial water service. Each consumer subscribing for uses of water services through the city shall pay a nonrefundable connection fee. (See appendix to Ordinance No. 96-4 and 96-10 for charges.) 
                  (b)  Meter for each unit. A separate meter is required for each individual dwelling unit and/or unit of business. All multiunit commercial or professional buildings shall have a meter installed for each unit. All multifamily dwellings shall have a meter installed for each unit. The prevailing service connection fee and meter installation fee shall be paid for each unit. 
                  (c)  Fire line installation. All individual dwelling units and/or units of business including all multiunit commercial or professional buildings that require fire installation must install a meter or backflow preventer or a detection check valve. All consumers who install a fire line will be required to pay the minimum monthly charge as set by the city commencing on the next billing date after the meter and a backflow preventer or a check detection valve are set and water is available. (See appendix to Ordinance No. 96-4 and 96-10 for charges.) 
                  (d)  Deposits. The city is authorized to establish deposit fees to be paid for water and sewer service and to collect such fees upon application for service and at such other times as the city may determine to be necessary.

                  (a)  Reading schedule. The water meter serving the consumer's property shall be read on a monthly basis and official records of each reading thereof shall be kept for a period of one year. 
                  (b)  Meter designation. Water meters shall be classified as either active meters, inactive meters and canceled meters. These designations are defined as follows: 
                  (1)  Active meters are defined as meters that are in normal use. All active meters will be charged on a monthly basis. 
                  (2)  Inactive meters are defined as meters that are installed where the consumer has notified the city in writing to temporarily terminate service. When it receives such written request, the city will seal the meter and declare the meter an inactive meter. When no responsible party is available to request inactive meter designation for the consumer, the city may declare the meter inactive. If a consumer desires to obtain water services after the meter has been declared inactive, the consumer shall pay the city a deposit and reconnection fee. In addition, the consumer must pay any previous unpaid bills which that consumer had through the city's services prior to obtaining any additional service from the city. Once the deposit, connection fee and any past due bills have been paid, the meter will be reclassified as an active meter as defined in subsection (b)(1) of this section. 
                  (3)  Canceled meters are defined as meters that have not been in use where the consumer has notified the city that no further water service from the city is desired. The city may, on its own initiative, declare a meter canceled when water has not been used for a period of 12 months or longer, excluding fire lines. If a meter is declared a canceled meter, the meter will be removed and the connection sealed. A consumer desiring reconnection of a canceled meter shall pay the deposit and connection fee that is in effect as of the date of application.

                  (a)  Payment. The consumer shall pay promptly on a monthly basis for all water registered by the meter serving such property at the rates set by the city from time to time, which shall include water used, water wasted or leakage, except for the water that may be traced by the city to the city's system. 
                  (b)  Billing schedule. Bills are sent out on the first day of each month. Bills shall be paid by the tenth day of each month. Payments received after the tenth will be assessed a ten percent late fee. If no payment is received, service will be discontinued on the 21st day of the month. If water service is disconnected for nonpayment of the bill, the city will not resume water service to the consumer until the bill, reconnection fees and all penalties have been paid in full. If the tenth day of the month falls on a Saturday, Sunday or a holiday, when city hall is closed, payments will be accepted without late charge on the following workday when city hall is open. 
                  (c)  Billing errors. If the consumer believes his bill to be in error, this claim must be presented to the city, or its billing agent, before the bill becomes due. Such claim, if made after the bill has become delinquent, shall not be effective in preventing discontinuance of service as provided in this section. The customer may pay such bill under protest and such payment shall not prejudice his claim. Any consumer who fails to notify the city in writing within 30 days after the date of such bill of any irregularities or errors that may be in such bill shall waive any right or claim for correction or refund under such bill. 
                  (d)  Meter failure. If the seal of a meter is broken by any person other than the city's representative, or if the meter fails to register correctly, or is stopped for any cause, the consumer shall pay an amount which is the average for the preceding month's water usage. 
                  (e)  Meter testing and rechecks. The city will carry out a regular program of meter testing and replacement. In addition, water meters will be tested at the request of the consumer. The city may make a charge for a consumer requested meter recheck. (See appendix to Ordinance No. 96-4 and 96-10 for charges.) 
                  (f)  Fee for bad checks. Consumers who make payments with checks which are not covered by sufficient funds will be charged a bad check fee as set by the city. When a consumer has written a check which has been returned for insufficient funds, the city will accept only cash or money orders for the next 12 months.

                  Editor's note— An ordinance adopted April 6, 1999, amended §§ 70-21—70-38 in their entirety. Formerly, said sections pertained to similar subject matter. See the Code Comparative Table. 

                  Sec. 70-21. - Intent and purpose. 
                  Whereas trees provide buffers and screens against noise and air pollution; whereas human and animal life depend upon the capacity of trees to absorb carbon dioxide and supply oxygen in our atmosphere; whereas trees filter out pollutants from the air; whereas trees provide a haven for birds which in turn assist in the control of insects; whereas trees are physiologically, sociologically and aesthetically necessary counterpoints to the manmade urban setting; whereas trees tend to conserve and increase property values; whereas it is the policy of the city to conserve, develop and utilize its natural resources; whereas it is the policy of the city to protect its atmosphere, lands and waters from pollution, impairment, or destruction for the benefit, enjoyment and general welfare of its people; it is, therefore, the purpose of this article to regulate the removal of trees from the public property within the city in order to preserve, protect and enhance a most valuable natural resource entrusted to the commonwealth and to protect the health, safety and welfare of its citizens. It is the purpose and intent of this article to establish standards limiting the removal of and insuring the replacement of trees sufficient to safeguard the ecological and aesthetic environment necessary to a healthy and happy community.

                  (Ord. No. 96-36, § II, 11-18-1996; Ord. of 4-6-1999) 
                  Sec. 70-23. - Public tree care and planting. 
                  The city shall have the right to plant, prune, maintain and remove trees, plants and shrubs within the right-of-way lines of all streets, to insure public safety or to preserve or enhance the symmetry and beauty of such public grounds. The administrative officer or the mayor and city council may remove or cause or order to be removed any street or park tree which is in an unsafe condition or which by reason of its nature is injurious to sewers, electric power lines, gas lines, water lines, or other public improvements, or is affected with any injurious fungus, insect or other pest. This section does not prohibit the planting of street trees by adjacent property owners providing that the selection and location of said trees is in accordance with sections 70-29 through 70-34 of this article. Only the city and those acting under its authority shall plant trees in the public right-of-way. 
                  (Ord. No. 96-36, § III, 11-18-1996; Ord. of 4-6-1999) 
                  Sec. 70-24. - Tree topping. 
                  It shall be unlawful as a normal practice for any person, firm or city department to top any street tree, park tree, or other tree on public property. Topping is defined as the severe cutting back of limbs to stubs larger than three inches in diameter within the tree's crown to such a degree so as to remove the normal canopy and disfigure the tree. Trees severely damaged by storms or other causes, or certain trees under utility wires or other obstructions where other pruning practices are impractical may be exempted from this article at the determination of the administrative officer or the mayor and city council. 
                  Cutting, killing or otherwise destroying trees by public service companies (other than the city) and natural gas companies performing normal construction and maintenance pursuant to applicable state or federal safety or construction laws and regulations is acceptable, provided, however, that the administrative officer shall review the procedures employed by such companies at least annually to determine whether they meet the purpose of this article, and shall recommend to the mayor and city council such additional ordinances as the administrative officer deems necessary to bring the procedures of such companies into compliance with the purpose of this article. 
                  (Ord. No. 96-36, § IV, 11-18-1996; Ord. of 4-6-1999) 
                  Sec. 70-25. - Pruning, corner clearance. 
                  Every owner of any tree overhanging any street or right-of-way within the city shall prune the branches so that such branches shall not obstruct the light of any street lamp or obstruct the view of any street intersection and so that there shall be a clear space of eight feet above the surface of the street or sidewalk. Said owners shall remove all dead, diseased, or dangerous trees, or broken or decayed limbs, which constitute a menace to the safety of the public. The city shall have the right to prune any portion of a tree or shrub that overhangs onto public right-of-way when it interferes with the proper spread of light along the street from a streetlight or interferes with visibility of any traffic control device or sign, or with pedestrian access on public walks or any public utility. 
                  (Ord. No. 96-36, § V, 11-18-1996; Ord. of 4-6-1999) 
                  Sec. 70-26. - Dead or diseased tree removal on private property. 
                  The mayor and city council, or the administrative officer, shall have the power to cause the removal of any dead or diseased trees on private property within the city, when such trees constitute a hazard to life or property, or harbor insects or disease which constitute a potential threat to other trees within the city. The mayor and city council or administrative officer shall notify in writing the owners or persons in possession of such trees. Removal shall be done by said owners or persons in possession at their own expense within 60 days after the date of service of notice. In the event of failure of the owners or persons in possession to comply with such a notice, the city shall be authorized to remove such trees and charge the costs of removal to the property owners or persons in possession. Failure to comply with an order to correct hazardous tree situations may also result in a citation pursuant to section 70-37, requiring the owners or persons in possession to appear before the municipal court. Nothing contained herein shall prevent the owners or persons in possession from negotiating with the city to allow the city access onto private property for the purposes of correction and/or removal, provided the owner or person in possession shall remain liable for the actual expenses of removal and disposal. 
                  (Ord. No. 96-36, § VI, 11-18-1996; Ord. of 4-6-1999) 
                  Sec. 70-27. - Arborist's license and bond. 
                  It shall be unlawful for any person or firm to engage in the business or occupation of pruning, treating or removing street or park trees within the city without first applying for and procuring a license. No license shall be required of any public service company or city employee doing such work in the pursuit of their public service endeavors. No license shall be issued to anyone to work on public trees in the right-of-way unless they are licensed contractors with minimal general liability insurance in the amount of $100,000.00 combined single limit.

                  Any commercial building permit application concerning property located within the city must be submitted to the administrative officer. The application must be accompanied by a site plan, which shall exhibit all existing trees on the public right-of-way. The plan shall indicate whether public trees are to remain or be removed. The administrative officer shall be responsible for implementation and maintenance of the tree preservation provisions of all site plans and accompanying information and exhibits immediately upon receipt of same. Applicant shall make every effort to avoid damaging public trees and provide site plans designed accordingly. All commercial site plans shall include a landscape easement, immediately adjacent to the right-of-way, which is a minimum of eight feet in width, for the purpose of tree planting, and exhibit tree planting based on the following schedule: 
                  Frontage less than 50 feet in length, one tree required. 
                  Frontage more than 50 feet in length, one tree per 50 feet plus one tree for any lineal footage over a multiple of 50 feet (example: 105 feet of frontage would require three trees). 
                  Existing trees may count towards the above schedule. If replacement trees are required by the administrative officer or the tree board, they shall equal or exceed the number of existing trees removed. 
                  Replacement trees shall be the minimum caliber nursery stock, as exhibited in the schedule below, balled and burlap or containerized. Owner/developer shall guarantee the survival and healthy condition of all replacement trees for two years from date of planting. The first three trees required of any site plan shall be shade trees from the large tree list below. Any other trees required above the quantity of three may be selected from the small or medium tree list.

                  The administrative officer shall carefully review all site plans and make decisions based upon this article and any other ordinance provision of the city or state or federal law or regulation. Any party who disagrees with a decision made by the administrative officer shall have a right to review before the tree board. The following rules for hearings and decisions shall apply: 
                  (1)  When deciding whether or not to approve a commercial site plan, the administrative officer shall consider only site plans which have been submitted to the planning and zoning office. If the administrative officer reaches any decision other than approval, he must notify the applicant in writing that the applicant's site plan for trees has been disapproved by the administrative officer and the specific reasons for the unfavorable decision. The applicant will be notified that he is entitled to a hearing before the administrative officer upon request. 
                  (2)  An applicant's request for a review hearing before the administrative officer must be in writing and must be delivered to the planning and zoning office within seven days of the date that the administrative officer mailed to the applicant a notice of an unfavorable decision. Upon the filing of such a request for hearing, the administrative officer shall conduct a hearing within seven days of the filing of the request. At the hearing, the administrative officer shall conduct the proceedings. The applicant will be entitled to appear and present relevant evidence. The administrative officer may also hear from any interested parties and consider any relevant facts, provided the applicant has an ample opportunity to examine same. The applicant shall be entitled to be represented by counsel. The administrative officer shall not have subpoena power. Minutes of the meeting, including a tape recording, shall be made by the administrative officer. 
                  (3)  At the hearing, the administrative officer may ask questions of the applicant and may attempt to resolve the issue(s) leading to the unfavorable decision by stipulation. After the hearing has been concluded the administrative officer will issue a decision in writing within 48 hours and deliver a copy to the applicant by regular mail. The decision will state specific reasons for any ruling other than approval of the tree site plan. The administrative officer may issue an approval of a site plan as amended by stipulation of the applicant, he may approve the plan as originally filed, or he may disapprove and state its specific reasons. 
                  (4)  An applicant may appeal any unfavorable ruling to the tree board, which shall conduct a de novo hearing. The applicant's rights will remain the same as in paragraph (2) above. An appeal to the tree board shall be in writing, and it shall include a copy of the administrative officer's decision and shall state specifically those portions of the administrative officer's decision with which the applicant disagrees. The appeal must be filed with the administrative officer within 30 days of the date of the administrative officer's decision. The tree board shall hear the appeal at the next regular tree board meeting after the appeal is filed. The decision of the tree board shall be issued in writing within 48 hours after the hearing and a copy shall be mailed to the applicant. Any decision that does not approve the site plan shall state specific reasons for the decision. 
                  (5)  The following rules of procedure shall apply in those cases where the mayor and city council or administrative officer exercises the power to cause the removal of any dead or diseased trees on private property, pursuant to the authority of section 70-26: 
                  a.  When it is determined that a tree or trees constitute a hazard to life or property or harbor insects or disease which constitute a potential threat to other trees within the city, the mayor and city council or administrative officer shall issue a written notice to the owners and persons in possession of the property stating the location of the tree or trees and the reason that removal is required. Such notice shall be in writing and shall notify the owners and persons in possession that they are to perform all removal and dispose of all debris within 60 days of the receipt of such notice. The notice will also state that any interested party has the right to demand a hearing before the tree board within seven days after service of the notice. A notice shall be considered served upon the owners or persons in possession when actually received by such interested party either by personal delivery or certified mail, return receipt requested, addressed and properly posted to the last known mailing address of the owner or person in possession. If such interested person cannot be found after diligent search or attempted delivery of the notice by certified mail is returned undelivered for any reason, notice shall be considered delivered when advertised in the official organ in the county for two consecutive weeks and a copy of the notice is conspicuously posted upon the premises which are the subject matter of the notice. The date of delivery in such cases shall be the later of the date of posting or the date of the publication of the last of the two advertisements. 
                  b.  If any owner or person in possession of the premises notifies the mayor and city council or administrative officer in writing of an objection to the planned action, a hearing will be scheduled before any action is taken upon the property in question. The hearing shall be conducted before the tree board, and the decision of the tree board can be appealed to the city council. Notice of the hearing, conduct of the hearing and notice of the decision will generally follow the same procedures as in cases of disapproval of site plans. 
                  c.  A decision of the tree board shall be appealable to the city council by the filing of a written notice of appeal in the office of the city clerk within seven days of the date of the written decision of the tree board. The initial 60-day period in which to comply with the order of the mayor and city council or administrative officer shall be tolled during the hearing and appeal process.
