            <p>PREFACE                  This Code constitutes a codification of the general and permanent ordinances of Marion County, Georgia.
                  Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances and resolutions of the county, as adopted by the
                  Board fo Commissioners through March 8, 2008. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in
                  parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time
                  with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any
                  section of the county's ordinances included herein.
                  5/30/2019 Marion County, GA Code of Ordinances
                  2/188
                  The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter
                  have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law
                  have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of
                  this Code.
                  Chapter and Section Numbering System
                  The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government
                  codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number,
                  and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is
                  numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the
                  same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new
                  material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section
                  would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be
                  placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article
                  embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included
                  by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained
                  when including new chapters.
                  Page Numbering System
                  The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which
                  represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that
                  portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of
                  an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are
                  typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

                  Index
                  The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of
                  which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government
                  officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user
                  to the particular item in which the user is interested.

                  Looseleaf Supplements
                  A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this
                  system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page
                  or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the
                  manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages.
                  Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are
                  received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached
                  instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid
                  misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.
                  Acknowledgments
                  This publication was under the direct supervision of Milt Lefkoff and Jim Jenkins, Code Attorneys, and William B. Eddy, Editor, of
                  the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for
                  their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project.
                  The publisher is most grateful to Wayne Jernigan, Sr., County Attorney for his cooperation and assistance during the progress
                  of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances
                  which will make the active law of the county readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day
                  administration of the county's affairs.

                  6/188
                  General. In the interpretation and application of any provision of this Code, it shall be held to be the minimum requirement
                  adopted for the promotion of the public health, safety, convenience and general welfare. Where any provision of the Code imposes
                  greater restrictions upon the subject matter than the general provision imposed by this Code, the provision imposing the greater

                  of any privilege or the discharge of any duty, the first day shall not be counted but the last day shall be counted; and, if the last day
                  falls on Saturday or Sunday, the party having such privilege or duty shall have through the following Monday to exercise the
                  privilege or to discharge the duty. When the last day prescribed for such action falls on a public and legal holiday as set forth in
                  O.C.G.A. Â§ 1-4-1, the party having the privilege or duty shall have through the next business day to exercise the privilege or to

                  subordinates to perform the required act or make the required inspection unless the terms of the provision or section designate
                  otherwise.
                  Joint authority. All words giving joint authority to three or more persons or officers shall be construed as giving such authority
                  to a majority of such persons or officers, except when such words are used to grant authority to the board of commissioners.

                  recognized as continuing in full force and effect to the same extent as if set out at length in this Code.

                  in the Code. The pages of a supplement shall be so numbered that they will fit properly into the Code and will,
                  where necessary, replace pages which have become obsolete or partially obsolete, and the new pages shall be so
                  prepared that, when they have been inserted, the Code will be current through the date of the adoption of the latest
                  resolution or ordinance included in the supplement.
                  In preparing a supplement to this Code, all portions of the Code which have been repealed shall be excluded from

                  When preparing a supplement to this Code, the codifier (meaning the person authorized to prepare the
                  supplement) may make formal, nonsubstantive changes in resolutions and parts of resolutions included in the
                  supplement, insofar as it is necessary to do so to embody them into a unified code. For example, the codifier may:
                  Organize the resolution or ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions.
                  Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in
                  the supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles.
                  Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the Code and, where
                  necessary to accommodate new material, change existing section or other subdivision numbers.
                  Change the words "this resolution" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this
                  division," etc., as the case may be, or to "sections ____________ to ____________" (inserting section numbers to
                  indicate the sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of the resolution or ordinance
                  incorporated into the Code).
                  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meanings of resolution or ordinance
                  sections inserted into the Code; but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of
                  resolution material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code.
                  Sec. 1-16. - Altering Code.
                  It shall be unlawful for any person in the county to change or amend by additions or deletions any part or portion of this Code,
                  or to insert or delete pages, or portions thereof, or to alter or tamper with such Code in any manner whatsoever which will cause
                  the law of the county to be misrepresented thereby, unless so authorized by resolution or ordinance or other official act of the
                  board of commissioners. Any person violating this section shall be punished as provided in section 1-17.

                  of their comments to the county clerk at least three business days before the board of commissioners
                  meeting. These individuals will be allotted three minutes to make their comments and their comments must
                  be limited to their chosen topic. These limits can be waived by a majority vote of the board of commissioners.

                  commissioners meeting and are expected to comply with the rules of decorum that are established for

                  the chairperson or on a point of order made by a commissioner. A majority vote of the board of
                  commissioners will rule on the point of order. An individual who violates the rules of decorum may be
                  removed from the meeting at the direction of the chairperson.
                  Public hearings. The board of commissioners may schedule public hearings for the purpose of soliciting public

                  An employee of the board of commissioners shall make every effort to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of
                  interest. An appearance of conflict exists when a reasonable person would conclude from the circumstances that
                  the employee's ability to protect the public interest, or perform public duties, is compromised by personal interests.
                  An appearance of conflict could exist even in the absence of a true conflict of interest.
                  An employee of the board of commissioners shall recuse himself from any proceeding in which the employee's

                  participant in the proceeding. The term "participant" includes, but is not limited to, an owner, shareholder, partner,
                  employee, resident, or agent of a business entity involved in the proceeding. If the employee is uncertain whether
                  the relationship justifies recusal, then the employee shall disclose the relationship to the person presiding over the
                  proceeding. The presiding officer shall determine the extent to which, if any, the employee will be permitted to
                  participate. If the affected employee is the person presiding, then the vice-chairperson or such other substitute
                  presiding officer shall make the determination.

                  his behalf, shall accept, directly or indirectly, any gift from any person with whom the employee interacts on official
                  business, including, without limitation, lobbyists and vendors which exceeds $100.00. If a gift has been accepted
                  which exceeds $100.00 it must be either returned to the donor or transferred to a charitable organization.
                  Where appropriate for purposes of tradition, ceremony, or intergovernmental relations, or when acting as a
                  representative of the board of commissioners, an employee may accept a gift in excess of $100.00 on behalf of the
                  board of commissioners. If the gift retains a value exceeding $100.00, after its acceptance, the employee must:
                  Maintain custody of the gift no longer than reasonably necessary to arrange for the transfer of custody of the
                  gift to the board of commissioners or a charitable organization on behalf of such;
                  File a report with the designated ethics officer no later than 30 days after receipt of the gift containing a
                  description of the gift, the approximate monetary value thereof, the name and address of the person making
                  the gift, the date the gift was made, and the disposition of the gift.

                  later than 30 days after such expenses are paid. The report shall be filed with the designated ethics officer. The report must
                  contain a description of each expense, the monetary value thereof, the name and address of the person paying such expense, and
                  the purpose, date, and location of the meeting. Notwithstanding this provision, the preferred practice is for agencies and not third
                  parties to pay such expenses.

                  The use of lobbyists will not be required or preferred as a way to obtain access to employees. Employees will
                  strongly encourage any lobbyist wishing to meet with the board of commissioners or staff regarding his client
                  and/or principal to bring a principal of his client to such meeting.
                  Former employees should not use their former positions for financial or other personal gain or to influence

                  would not have the potential to create a conflict and do not impair the employee's ability to discharge his public duties fully,

                  political campaigns outside of working hours, including the wearing of badges or buttons and displaying of bumper
                  stickers and posters. Employees are encouraged to vote outside of working hours.

                  In cases where a county has an organization for emergency management, such organization shall include participation by each
                  city within the county unless the governing authority of any particular city elects to implement its own organization for emergency
                  management. Any two or more of the above-mentioned political subdivisions may, with the approval of the director, contract with
                  each other so as to form one emergency management organization for the entire area included in the bounds of the contracting
                  political subdivisions. The executive officer or governing body of the political subdivision is authorized to nominate a local director
                  to the director of emergency management who shall have the authority to make the appointment. Upon appointment, the local
                  emergency management agency director shall have direct responsibility for the organization, administration, and operations of the
                  local organization for emergency management, subject to the direction and control of the executive officer or governing body and

                  except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
                  Aquifer means any stratum (rock layer) or zone of rock beneath the surface of the earth capable of containing or producing
                  water from a well.
                  Groundwater recharge area means an area of the earth's surface where water infiltrates the ground, thereby replenishing the
                  groundwater supplies within an aquifer. The term "groundwater recharge area" is synonymous with the term "aquifer recharge
                  area."
                  Pollution susceptibility means the relative vulnerability of groundwater to pollution from chemical spills, leaching of pollutants
                  from dump sites, animal waste from agricultural operations or pollution generated by other human activities.
                  Pollution susceptibility maps means maps prepared by the state department of natural resources that show the relative
                  susceptibility of groundwater to pollution. Pollution susceptibility maps categorize the land areas of the state into areas of high,
                  medium and low groundwater pollution potential.
                  Significant groundwater recharge areas means areas mapped by the state department of natural resources in Hydrologic Atlas
                  18 (1989 edition). Mapping of recharge areas is based on outcrop area, lithology (chemical nature and form of rock), soil type and
                  thickness, slope, density of lithologic contacts, geologic structure, presence of "karst" topography (sinkholes, caves and fissures
                  associated with limestone and other carbonate rocks), and potentiometric surfaces.

                  Sec. 26-62. - Findings of fact.
                  In order to provide for the health, safety and welfare of the public and to promote a healthy economic climate in the
                  county and surrounding communities, it is essential that public drinking water resources of high quality be ensured.
                  For this reason, it is necessary to protect the subsurface water resources in the county and surrounding
                  communities rely upon such resources as sources of public water.
                  Groundwater resources are contained within aquifers, which are permeable rock strata occupying vast regions of
                  the subsurface. These aquifers are replenished by infiltration of surface water runoff in zones of the surface known
                  as groundwater recharge areas. Groundwater is susceptible to contamination when unrestricted development
                  occurs within significant groundwater recharge areas. It is, therefore, necessary to manage land use within
                  groundwater recharge areas to ensure that pollution threats to water resources are minimized.

                  The objectives of this article are to:
                  Protect groundwater quality by restricting land uses that generate, use or store dangerous pollutants in
                  recharge areas;
                  Protect groundwater quality by limiting density of development; and
                  Protect groundwater quality by ensuring that any development that occurs within the recharge area shall have
                  no adverse effect on groundwater quality.

                  county, outside the City of Buena Vista, that are mapped and designated as significant recharge areas by the state department of

                  The permitting officer shall have the authority to issue cease and desist orders in the event of any
                  violation of this article. Cease and desist orders may be appealed to a court of competent jurisdiction, as
                  identified in this article.
                  When the permitting officer determines that a building or other structure has been constructed in
                  violation of this article, the violator may, at the discretion of the permitting officer, be required to remove
                  the structure.
                  When removal of vegetative cover, excavation or fill has taken place in violation of this article, the violator
                  may be required to restore the affected land to its original contours and to restore vegetation, as far as
                  practicable.
                  Permit review and site plan requirement. With the exception of certain exempted activities identified in
                  subsection (4) of this section, applications for a development permit within the groundwater recharge area
                  district shall include a site plan providing the following information:
                  A map, drawn to a scale of one inch equals 50 feet, showing all planned improvements including the
                  width, depth and length of all existing and proposed structures, roads, water courses and drainage ways,
                  water lines, wastewater and stormwater facilities and utility installations.
                  Location, dimensions and area of all impervious surfaces, both existing and proposed, on the site.
                  The orientation and distance from the boundaries of the proposed site to the nearest bank of an affected
                  perennial stream or water body.
                  Elevations of the site and adjacent lands within 200 feet of the site at contour intervals of no greater than
                  five feet.
                  Location and detailed design of any spill and leak collection systems designed for the purpose of
                  containing hazardous or toxic materials which may be released accidentally.
                  Calculations of the amount of cut and fill proposed and cross sectional drawings showing existing and
                  proposed grades in areas of fill or excavation. Elevations, horizontal scale and vertical scale must be
                  shown on cross sectional drawings.
                  Activities to comply with site plan. All development activities or site work conducted after approval of the site
                  plan shall conform with the specifications of the site plan. Significant changes to the site plan that would alter
                  the amount and velocity of stormwater runoff from the site, increase the amount of impervious surface within
                  the development, alter the overall density of development, result in a considerable increase in the amount of
                  excavation, fill or removal of vegetation during construction or otherwise result in an alteration of the overall

                  sewage management system as meeting requirements outlined in section M of the state department of human
                  resources (DHR) manual for on-site sewage management systems, incorporated herein by reference, and the
                  required building permits have been issued.
                  Minimum lot size requirements in areas of significant groundwater recharge.
                  The following minimum lot size requirements apply to on-site sewage management systems in areas of
                  significant groundwater recharge. Minimum lot sizes shall be based on application of table MT-1 of the
                  referenced DHR manual:
                  150 percent of the subdivision minimum lot size calculated based on application of DHR table MT-1 if they
                  are within a high pollution susceptibility area;
                  125 percent of the subdivision minimum lot size calculated based on application of DHR Table MT-1 if
                  they are within a medium pollution susceptibility area;
                  110 percent of the subdivision minimum lot size calculated based on application of DHR table MT-1 if they
                  are within a low pollution susceptibility area.
                  The minimums set forth in subsections (j)(1), (2) and (3) of this section may be increased based on
                  consideration of factors such as those enumerated in section M of the state department of human resources

                  The text set forth in this section is from the state department of human resources manual for on-site sewage management
                  systems, section M, pages M-1 and M-2, and is included here for convenience only. In the event of any conflict between the
                  following text and the referenced manual, the referenced manual shall govern:
                  Lot sizing. To provide for the orderly and safe development of property utilizing on-site sewage management
                  systems, minimum lot sizes have been established. Larger lot sizes may be required to meet the requirements
                  of this manual depending on the proposed development of the property. County boards of health and/or
                  county zoning authorities may require larger minimum lot sizes; the larger minimum lot sizes will take
                  precedence.
                  Single-family dwellings. Lot size requirements are for single-family dwellings, including, but not limited to,
                  manufactured or mobile homes, stick built homes, modular homes, etc., and individual lots in
                  subdivisions or mobile home lots located in areas other than commercial mobile home parks. Area
                  requirements for multiple dwellings on a single recorded lot, where not prohibited by local zoning, must
                  be provided in multiples of the following minimum lot sizes for each dwelling to be constructed on the
                  recorded lot. See table MT-1 and subsections (1)a.1â6 of this section as follows:

                  supply system which is not a public water supply system.
                  The minimum lot sizes in the table in this subsection are for the typical size home (three or four
                  bedroom) with basic appurtenances such as: driveway, minimum number of trees, and water supply
                  line. If larger homes, swimming pools, tennis courts or outbuildings, etc. are proposed to be
                  constructed, or if trees would interfere with installation of an on-site sewage management system,
                  the county board of health will require larger lots to ensure useable soil area.
                  The county board of health may also require larger lot sizes when physical factors indicate the need
                  to do so. These factors include, but are not limited to, the availability of sufficient unobstructed land
                  areas for an approved on-site sewage management system and approved replacement system,
                  slope greater than five percent, percolation rates higher than 45 minutes per inch, need for
                  subsurface drainage or adverse topographic features.
                  Lots shall be a minimum width of 100 feet or 150 feet measured within the area where an approved
                  on-site sewage management system and replacement system are to be located when served by a
                  public water supply system or nonpublic water supply system, respectively.
                  The following land areas are not considered as a part of a lot when calculating the required
                  minimum lot size:
                  Rights-of-way of roads;
                  Easements (such as power line or pipe line) that exclude installation of an on-site sewage
                  management system;
                  Bodies of water;
                  Land within 50 feet of a lake, river, stream, wetland or other bodies of water; and
                  Similar limiting factors.
                  There must be an unobstructed area on each lot for installation of an approved on-site sewage
                  management system and an area equal in size for a conventional system or larger area, as
                  appropriate, for an approved replacement system; this will include sufficient area for necessary site
                  modifications for installation of both the initial system and a replacement system. All pertinent
                  county zoning setbacks and other space requirements must be also be met.
                  The maximum daily sewage flow for each lot or parcel of land shall not exceed 600 gpd when served
                  by nonpublic or individual water supply system or 1,200 gpd when served by public water supply
                  system. When sewage flows exceed these qualities (600 or 1,200 gpd as indicated) for a given
                  dwelling structure, the minimum lot size or parcel of land shall be increased proportionally.
                  Example: Assume a public water supply exists (so 1,200 gpd maximum sewage flow allowed per
                  minimum required land area of 21,780 square feet), and there is a proposed sewage flow of 5,000
                  gpd.
                  To determine X = the square footage of the lot needed, use the following formula:
                  X = 5,000 gallons/acre/day 1,200 gallons/acre/day

                  Sec. 26-102. - Findings and purpose.
                  Findings of fact. Wetlands are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints
                  due to flooding, erosion and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. Wetlands
                  provide habitat for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control;
                  erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; and open space and recreational opportunities. In
                  addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well-being of many communities
                  within the state. Nationally, a considerable number of wetland resources have been lost or impaired by draining,
                  dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution and other acts. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public
                  safety and the general welfare. It is, therefore, necessary to discourage development activities that may adversely
                  affect wetlands by ensuring maximum protection for wetlands located in the unincorporated area of the county.
                  Purpose. The purpose of this article is to promote wetland protection, while taking into account varying ecological,
                  economic development, recreational and aesthetic values. Activities that may damage wetlands should be located
                  on upland sites to the greatest degree practicable as determined through a permitting process. The objective of this
                  article is to protect wetlands from alterations that will significantly affect or reduce their primary functions for water
                  quality, floodplain and erosion control, groundwater recharge, aesthetic, nature and wildlife habitat.

                  Generalized wetland map. This article shall apply to all lands within wetlands located in the unincorporated area of
                  the county outside the municipalities. The generalized wetland map adopted as part of this article shows the
                  general location of wetlands and should be consulted by persons contemplating activities in or near wetlands. The

                  generalized wetland map, together with all explanatory matter thereon and attached thereto, is adopted by
                  reference and declared to be part of this article. The generalized wetland map shall be on file in the office of the
                  county clerk.
                  Boundaries. The generalized wetland map is a general reference document, and wetland boundaries indicated on
                  the map are approximations. The purpose of the generalized wetland map is to alert developers/landowners that a
                  subject site may be in a jurisdictional wetland or in proximity to a jurisdictional wetland, requiring the
                  developer/landowner to seek U.S. Army Corps of Engineers guidance as to whether a section 404 permit will be
                  required prior to initiation of any development activity on the subject site. The generalized wetland map does not
                  represent precise boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands in the unincorporated area of the county, and cannot serve
                  as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by section
                  404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this does not relieve the landowner
                  from federal or state permitting requirements.

                  Sec. 26-104. - Local development permits.
                  Local development permit requirements. No regulated activity will be allowed within the wetland protection district
                  without written permission from the permitting officer in the form of a local development permit. Issuance of a local
                  development permit is contingent on full compliance with the terms of this and other applicable regulations. All
                  activities that are not identified in subsection (b) of this section shall be prohibited without prior issuance of a local
                  development permit. If the area proposed for development appears to be located within a wetland protection
                  district boundary, or within 50 feet of the wetland protection district boundary, as determined by the permitting
                  officer from review of the generalized wetland map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required.
                  If the Corps determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site and that a section 404 permit
                  or letter of permission is required, a local development permit will be issued only following receipt by the local
                  permitting officer of a copy of the section 404 permit or letter of permission issued by the U.S. Army Corps of
                  Engineers.
                  Permissible uses (uses as of right). The following uses shall be allowed as of right within a wetland to the extent they
                  are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law, including laws of trespass, and provided they do not require
                  structures, grading, fill, draining or dredging except as provided herein:
                  Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish and other wildlife, provided they do not affect
                  waters of the state or of the United States in such a way that would require an individual 404 permit.
                  Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding and
                  canoeing.
                  Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the Georgia Forestry
                  Commission and as specified in section 404 of the Clean Water Act.
                  The continued cultivation of agricultural crops. Agricultural activities shall, however, be subject to best
                  management practices approved by the state department of agriculture. Disturbances of wetlands for
                  agricultural purposes are subject to the Swampbuster Act of the 1985 Farm Bill, and are to be reported to the
                  USDA Farm Service Agency prior to commencement.
                  The pasturing of livestock, provided that riparian wetlands are protected, that soil profiles are not disturbed
                  and that approved agricultural best management practices are followed.
                  Education, scientific research and nature trails.
                  Temporary emergency permit. A temporary emergency permit can be issued by the permitting officer for the
                  following reasons:
                  Maintenance or repair of lawfully located roads or structures and of facilities used in the service of the public

                  prior to the commencement of work has been given to the permitting officer, and provided that the work is
                  conducted using best management practices to ensure that flow and circulation patterns and chemical and
                  biological characteristics of the wetland are not impaired, and that any adverse effect on the aquatic
                  environment will be minimized.
                  Temporary water level stabilization measures associated with ongoing silvicultural operations.
                  Limited ditching, tilling, dredging, excavating or filling done solely for the purpose of maintaining or repairing
                  existing drainage systems necessary for the cultivation of agricultural crops, provided the maintenance or
                  repair activity does not result in the impairment, alteration or loss of wetlands not previously subject to
                  agricultural and silvicultural use under the terms and provisions of subsection (b)(4) of this section.
                  Limited excavating and filling necessary for the repair and maintenance of piers, walkways, nature trails,
                  observation decks, wildlife management shelters, boathouses or other similar water-related structures,
                  provided such facilities and structures are built on pilings to allow unobstructed flow of water and preserve the
                  natural contour of the wetland.
                  Site plans. Applications for a local development permit within the generalized wetland protection district shall
                  include a site plan, drawn to a scale of one inch equals 50 feet, unless a different scale is approved, in advance, by
                  the permitting officer, with the following information:
                  A map of all planned excavation and fill, including calculations of the volume of cut and fill involved with cross
                  sectional drawings showing existing and proposed grades. Elevations, horizontal scale and vertical scale must
                  be shown on the cross sectional drawings.
                  A map of any wetland boundaries occurring within the site must be provided. This boundary may be included
                  on other maps provided by the applicant.
                  Location, dimensions and area of all impervious surfaces, both existing and proposed, on the site and adjacent
                  to the site for a distance of 200 feet.
                  The orientation and distance from the boundaries of the subject site to the nearest bank of an affected
                  perennial stream or water body.
                  Elevation of the site and adjacent lands within 200 feet of the site at contour intervals of no greater than two
                  feet; and no greater than one foot for slopes less than or equal to two percent.
                  Location and detailed design of any spill and leak collection systems designed for the purpose of containing
                  hazardous or toxic materials released accidentally.
                  All proposed temporary disruptions or diversions of local hydrology.
                  Activities to comply with site plan. All development activities or site work conducted after approval of the site plan
                  shall conform with the specifications of such site plan. The site plan may be amended only with approval of the
                  permitting officer. The permitting officer may require additional information deemed necessary to verify compliance
                  with the provisions of this article or to evaluate the proposed use in terms of the purposes of this article.
                  Subdivision approval in the wetland protection district. Any application for subdivision approval shall include a
                  jurisdictional determination approved by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. If the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
                  determines that wetlands are present and that a section 404 permit or letter of permission is required, subdivision
                  approval will be issued only following issuance of the section 404 permit or letter of permission.
                  Subdivision design options in the wetland protection district. Any subdivision that includes jurisdictional wetlands
                  shall be allowed and encouraged to use the following options:
                  Lot size averaging. Lot size averaging is encouraged in single-family detached subdivisions as a means to work
                  around wetland areas. The permitting officer may allow a reduction in lot size provided the same number of

                  (a)
                  lots in the same subdivision are oversized by an equal or greater area. The maximum permissible reduction
                  shall not exceed 25 percent of the minimum required lot area. The number of lots with areas reduced shall not
                  exceed 25 percent of the total number of lots in the subdivision. The permitting officer shall allow no more
                  than a 25 percent adjustment of rear, side and front setbacks for each affected lot.
                  Cluster development. Clustering of residential development is encouraged in single-family detached
                  subdivisions as a way around wetland areas. When considering subdivision approval, the permitting officer
                  may allow incorporation of wetland or other significant natural areas as open space in the subdivision plan.
                  Such plans should designate at least 25 percent of the gross land area as open space. Density shall be
                  calculated by subtracting from the total acreage of a parcel all land dedicated or in use for private or public
                  roads, including all vehicular rights-of-way. The resultant acreage will then be divided by the minimum allowed
                  lot size of the district to derive the number of lots permissible.
                  Filing fee. At the time of the application, the applicant shall pay a filing fee specified by the permitting officer. Filing
                  fees of $150.00 shall be required to evaluate the application. However, if, after review of the initial application, it is
                  determined that expert consultants are necessary to provide services pertaining to functional assessment,
                  mitigation and wetland boundary determination, those fees will be in addition to the filing fee. The additional fee
                  may be used to retain expert consultants who will provide services as deemed necessary by the permitting officer.
                  Enforcement authority. The permitting officer is the department, office or individual assigned the responsibility of
                  administering this article. At the time the ordinance from which this article derives is adopted, the administrative
                  authority is vested in the office of the county clerk.
                  Review procedures. The application shall be made to the permitting officer and will be reviewed within 14 days. The
                  review period shall begin upon the permitting officer's written determination that the application is complete. The
                  review period shall include the preparation of findings (approval, conditional approval or disapproval) by the
                  permitting officer. The applicant will receive written notification of the findings of the permitting officer. If the review
                  process is not completed and written findings not released within 30 days, the application is considered to be
                  approved.
                  Appeals. Decisions on permit applications made by the permitting officer may be appealed to the board of
                  commissioners. The appeal must be submitted in writing to the county clerk within ten days of the decision
                  rendered by the permitting officer. A public hearing shall be held by the board of commissioners for appeals. Public
                  announcement of the hearing shall be printed in a local newspaper of general circulation at least 15 days but not
                  more than 45 days prior to the hearing. Any person may offer testimony at the hearing. The decision of the board of
                  commissioners shall be issued within 15 days of the public hearing and may be appealed to the county superior
                  court.
                  Duration of permit validity.
                  If construction described in the development permit has not commenced within six months from the date of
                  issuance, the permit shall expire.
                  If construction described in the development permit is suspended or abandoned after work has commenced,
                  the permit shall expire six months after the date work ceased.
                  Written notice of the pending expiration of the development permit may be issued by the permitting officer,
                  but no such notification is required.

                  The permitting officer shall have authority to enter the subject site to monitor development and to enforce this
                  article, issue permits hereunder, and address violations or threatened violations hereof by issuance of
                  violation notices, administrative orders and civil and criminal actions. All costs, fees and expenses in
                  connection with such actions may be recovered as damages against the violator.
                  Law enforcement officials or other officials having police powers in the jurisdiction shall have authority to
                  assist the permitting officer with enforcement.
                  The permitting officer shall have authority to issue cease and desist orders in the event of any violation of this
                  article. Cease and desist orders may be appealed to a court of competent jurisdiction, as identified herein.
                  The permitting officer may require a bond with surety and conditions sufficient to secure compliance with the
                  conditions set forth in the permit. The particular amount and the conditions of the bond shall be consistent with the
                  purposes of this article. In the event of a breach of any condition of any such bond, the permitting officer may
                  institute an action in a court of competent jurisdiction upon such bond and prosecute the same to judgment and
                  execution.
                  When the permitting officer determines a building or other structure has been constructed in violation of this
                  article, the violator may, at the discretion of the permitting officer, be required to remove the structure.
                  When removal of vegetative cover, excavation or fill has taken place in violation of this article, the violator may, at
                  the discretion of the permitting officer and as far as practicable, be required to restore the affected land to its
                  original contours and to restore vegetation.
                  If the permitting officer discovers a violation of this article that also constitutes a violation of any provision of the
                  Clean Water Act, 33 USC 26-1251 et seq., as amended, the permitting officer shall issue written notification of the
                  violation to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the
                  landowner.
                  The permitting officer may suspend or revoke a permit if he finds the applicant has not complied with the
                  conditions or limitations set forth in the permit or has exceeded the scope of the work set forth in the permit. The
                  permitting officer shall cause notice of denial, issuance, conditional issuance, revocation or suspension of a permit
                  to be published in a daily newspaper having a broad circulation in the area where the wetland is located.

                  applicant's land;
                  Approve the permit application with lesser restrictions or conditions (i.e., grant a variance); or

                  nonprofit organization restricting activities in a wetland shall have that portion of land assessed consistent with those restrictions.
                  Such landowner shall also be exempted from special assessment on the wetland to defray the cost of municipal improvements
                  such as sanitary sewers, storm sewers and water mains.

                  authorized to enter upon private property for the purpose of collection of solid waste when other than roadside
                  collection has been requested by the owner or occupant of a residential unit and approved by the county.

                  ARTICLE II. - TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES
                  Sec. 58-23. - Purpose.
                  The purpose of the supplemental regulations is to:
                  Promote health, safety, and the general welfare of the residents of the county;
                  Provide standards for the safe provision of telecommunications consistent with applicable federal and state
                  regulations;
                  Minimize the total number of telecommunications towers in the community by encouraging shared use of
                  existing and future towers and the use of existing tall buildings and other high structures and by encouraging
                  alternative technologies that would minimize the need for multiple towers; and
                  Minimize adverse visual effects from telecommunications towers by requiring careful siting, visual impact
                  assessment, and appropriate landscaping.

                  Sec. 58-24. - Special permit, site plan approval and variance.
                  Telecommunications facilities may be constructed anywhere in the county, but only if the person seeking to erect same shall
                  have obtained a special permit and site plan approval from the planning board in accordance with this section and the other
                  provisions of this article governing issuance of special permits and site plan approves prior to any construction. If the proposed
                  height of the telecommunications facility exceeds the permitted height of structures in the zoning district in which the facility is
                  proposed to be located, notwithstanding any other provisions of this article, a height variance from the board of appeals shall also
                  be required.

                  No special permit or renewal thereof or modification of a current special permit relating to a telecommunications
                  facility shall be authorized by the planning board unless it finds that such telecommunications facility:
                  Is necessary to meet current or reasonably expected demands for services;
                  Conforms with all federal and state laws and all applicable rules or regulations promulgated by the Federal

                  Is sited, designed and constructed in a manner which minimizes:
                  Visual impact to the extent practical; and
                  Adverse impacts upon migratory and other birds and wildlife;
                  Complies with all other requirements of this article, unless expressly superseded herein;
                  Is the most appropriate site among those available within the technically feasible area for the location of a
                  telecommunications facility;
                  When including the construction of a tower, is designed to accommodate future shared use by at least two
                  other telecommunication service providers.
                  Any subsequent location of telecommunication equipment by other service providers on existing towers specifically
                  designed for shared use shall not require a new or modified special permit if there would be no increase in the
                  height of the tower and if the tower's original design was adequate to accommodate the proposed additional
                  equipment. At the option of the building and zoning enforcement officer, there may be required, before issuance of
                  a building permit, an engineer's certificate or report to the effect that with the proposed additional equipment the
                  existing tower continues to be safe and meets all then currently applicable design and construction criteria in
                  accordance with generally accepted good engineering practices and generally accepted industry standards.

                  Sec. 58-26. - Collocation.
                  The shared use of existing telecommunications facilities or other structures shall be preferred to the construction of
                  new facilities. Any special permit application, renewal or modification thereof shall include proof that reasonable
                  efforts have been made to collocate within an existing telecommunications facility or upon an existing structure.
                  The application shall include an adequate inventory report specifying existing telecommunications facility sites and
                  structures exceeding 75 percent of the height of the proposed tower within the search range of the cell grid. The
                  inventory report shall contain an evaluation of opportunities for shared use as an alternative to the proposed
                  location.
                  The applicant must demonstrate that the proposed telecommunications facility cannot be accommodated on
                  existing telecommunications facility sites in the inventory due to one or more of the following reasons:
                  The planned equipment would exceed the structural capacity of existing and approved telecommunications
                  facilities or other structures, considering existing and reasonably anticipated future use for those facilities;
                  The planned equipment would cause radio frequency interference with other existing or planned equipment,
                  which cannot be reasonably prevented;
                  Existing or approved telecommunications facilities or other structures do not have space and cannot be
                  modified to provide space on which proposed equipment can be placed so it can function effectively and
                  reasonably;
                  Other technical reasons make it impracticable to place the equipment proposed by the applicant on existing
                  facilities or structures;
                  The property owner or owner of the existing telecommunications facility or other structure refuses to allow
                  such collocation.

                  In determining whether a site is appropriate, and if it is determined a need exists for the telecommunications facility, the
                  preferential order of location, to the extent the same may be, or may be made, technically feasible, is as follows:
                  Collocated on existing telecommunications towers;
                  Collocated on any other existing radio or other tower that would not require any increase in height nor
                  significant noticeable structural additions to accommodate the telecommunications facility;
                  Within any industrial zones or existing planned development zones that permit industrial activities.

                  Sec. 58-28. - Dimensional standards.
                  A fall zone around any tower constructed as part of a telecommunications facility must have a radius at least equal
                  to the height of the tower and any attached antennas. The entire fall zone may not include public roads and must be
                  located on property either owned or leased by the applicant or for which the applicant has obtained an easement,
                  and may not, except as set forth in this section, contain any structure other than those associated with the
                  telecommunications facility. If the facility is attached to an existing structure, relief may be granted by specific
                  permission of the planning board on a case-by-case basis if it is determined by such board, after submission of
                  competent evidence, that the waiver of this requirement will not endanger the life, health, welfare or property of
                  any person. In granting any such waiver, the board may impose any conditions reasonably necessary to protect the
                  public or other property from potential injury.
                  All telecommunications facilities shall be located on a single parcel.
                  All telecommunications facilities shall comply with the setback, frontage, minimum lot size, and yard standards of
                  the underlying zoning district and the fall zone requirements of this article. To the extent there is a conflict, the
                  more restrictive provision shall govern. The size of the leased or owned lot, together with any land over which the
                  applicant has obtained an easement, shall be, at a minimum, sufficiently large to include the entire fall zone. All lots
                  leased or owned for the purpose of construction of a tower as part of telecommunications facility shall conform, at
                  a minimum, to the lot size requirements of the underlying zoning district or the size of lot necessary to encompass
                  the entire fall zone (to the extent easements for any part of the fall zone that extends outside the minimum lot sized
                  permitted in the zoning district have not been obtained), whichever requirement results in a larger lot.
                  Notwithstanding provisions to the contrary of any other section of this article, the front, side, and rear yard
                  requirements of the underlying zoning district in which a telecommunications facility is erected shall apply not only
                  to a tower, but also to all tower parts including guy wires and anchors, and to any accessory buildings.

                  Towers shall not be artificially lighted and marked beyond the requirements of the FAA.
                  Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, an applicant may be compelled to add FAA-style lighting and marking,
                  if, in the judgment of the planning board, such a requirement would be of direct benefit to public safety and would
                  not unduly adversely affect residents of any surrounding property.

                  but not limited to, company name, phone numbers, banners, streamers, and balloons, is prohibited.
                  The facility shall have the least practical visual effect on the environment, as determined by the planning board. Any

                  Be disguised or camouflaged to blend in with the surroundings, to the extent that such alteration does not
                  impair the ability of the facility to perform its designed function.
                  Without limiting the requirements of subsection (b) of this section, existing on-site vegetation shall be preserved to
                  the maximum extent possible, and no cutting of trees exceeding four inches in diameter (measured at a height of
                  four feet off the ground) shall occur in connection with the telecommunications facility prior to the granting of
                  special permit and site plan approval. The clearcutting of all trees in a single contiguous area exceeding 20,000
                  square feet shall be prohibited.
                  The planning board may require additional information, such as line-of-sight drawings, detailed elevation maps,
                  visual simulations, before and after renderings, and alternate tower designs to more clearly identify adverse
                  impacts for the purpose of their mitigation.
                  Equipment or vehicles not used in direct support, renovations, additions or repair of any telecommunications facility
                  shall not be stored or parked on the facility site.

                  Access ways shall make maximum use of existing public or private roads to the extent practicable. New access ways
                  constructed solely for telecommunications facilities must be at least 12 but no more than 24 feet wide, and closely
                  follow natural contours to ensure minimal visual disturbance and reduce soil erosion potential.
                  The road surface (driveways) shall be centered within access ways and shall not comprise more than 60 percent of
                  the width of the access way.
                  Parking areas shall be sufficient to accommodate the usual number of service vehicles expected on the premises at
                  any one time. Space off of public highways shall be provided (not necessarily in parking areas) to accommodate the
                  greatest number of service vehicles expected on the premises at any one time.
                  Driveways or parking areas shall provide adequate interior turnaround, such that service vehicles will not have to
                  back out onto a public thoroughfare.

                  Towers, anchor points of guyed towers, and accessory structures shall each be surrounded by fencing at least eight
                  feet in height, the top foot of which will be comprised of three strands of barbed wire to discourage unauthorized
                  access to the site.
                  There shall be no permanent climbing pegs within 15 feet of the ground of any tower.
                  A locked gate at the junction of the access way and a public thoroughfare may be required to obstruct entry by
                  unauthorized vehicles. Such gate must not protrude into the public right-of-way.

                  submit an agreement to remove all antennas, structures, lighting, utilities, fencing, gates, accessory equipment or
                  structures, as well as any towers dedicated solely for use within a telecommunications facility if such facility
                  becomes technologically obsolete or ceases to perform its originally intended function for more than one
                  consecutive months. Upon removal of said facility, the land shall be restored to its previous condition, including, but
                  not limited to, the seeding of exposed soils, unless the land owner notifies the planning board in writing that any
                  buildings or roads may remain.
                  At the time of obtaining a building permit, the applicant must provide a financial security bond for removal of the
                  telecommunications facility and property restoration, with the municipality as the assignee, in an amount approved
                  by the planning board, but not less than $50,000.00.
                  At times of modification of the special permit, the planning board may adjust the required amount of the financial
                  security bond to adequately cover increases in the cost of removal of the telecommunications facility and property
                  restoration.

                  dam, lake and pond in the subdivision to the homeowner's association.
                  The county does not and will not accept title or responsibility for any dam or lake and will not accept title or

                  (Res. of 3-8-2008)
                  Sec. 3.02. - District boundaries.
                  The boundaries of the above districts are shown on a set of maps designated "Official Zoning Map, Marion County,
                  Georgia."
                  Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of any district as shown on the official zoning map, the
                  following rules shall apply:
                  Where zoning district boundaries are indicated as following the center lines of roads or highways or railroad
                  rights-of-way, or extensions to said center lines or rights-of-way such center lines or rights-of-way or
                  extensions of such lines shall be construed to be such boundaries.
                  Where district boundaries are indicated as following the county line, the corporate limits line of any
                  incorporated place, the militia district line of any militia district, or the land lot line of any land lot, such county
                  line, corporate limits line, militia district line or land lot line shall be construed to be such boundaries.
                  Where district boundaries are indicated as parallel to the center lines of streets or highways, such district
                  boundaries, unless otherwise specifically indicated, shall be construed as being parallel thereto and at a
                  distance of 200 or 500 feet from the right-of-way line of such streets and highways with each such boundary
                  being shown at scale on the official zoning map.
                  Where district boundaries are indicated as following the center line of stream beds or river beds, or extensions
                  thereof, such center lines or such lines extended shall be construed to be such boundaries.
                  Sec. 3.03. - District boundary lines dividing a lot.
                  In the event a district boundary line on the zoning map divides a lot of record held in one ownership on the date of passage of
                  this chapter [appendix], each part of the lot so divided shall be used in conformity with the regulations established by this chapter
                  [appendix] for the district in which each such part is located; except, however, that if the property owner of such a lot so desires,
                  he may extend a use allowed on said lot 50 feet beyond the district boundary line but shall comply with setbacks and yard
                  requirements of the district into which he is encroaching.
                  Sec. 3.04. - Limited use (L.U.) provisions.
                  The board of commissioners establishes the limited use provision for the purpose of allowing an applicant to request that a
                  certain area be designated as a limited use. In some areas of the county a particular land use activity out of a general zoning
                  classification may have less community impact than some of the possibilities of uses in that specific classification. For this reason,
                  an applicant may request in his rezoning petition to limit the use of a proposed property to a specified use only, e.g., L.U./beauty
                  shop. The limited use must be among the uses permitted in the zoning classification for which the limited use is taken.

                  ARTICLE IV. - GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
                  Sec. 4.01. - Conicting regulations.
                  Whenever any provision of this chapter [appendix] imposes more stringent requirements, regulations, restrictions or
                  limitations than are imposed or required by any other county ordinance, this chapter [appendix] shall govern.
                  Sec. 4.02. - Scope.
                  No building or structure, as defined herein, or part thereof, shall hereinafter be erected, constructed, reconstructed, or altered
                  and maintained, and no new use or change shall be made or maintained of any building, structure or land, or part thereof, except
                  in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. Land, structures and buildings presently used for agricultural purposes are
                  exempted from residential, commercial and industrial zoning restrictions; however, any present agricultural use and/or
                  improvement must satisfy agriculture district regulations regardless of the district within which they are developed.
                  Sec. 4.03. - Only one principal building per lot.
                  Except as herein provided, there shall be no more than one principal building per lot or parcel other than within a (residential
                  or commercial) planned unit development (PUD). For the purpose of supporting farming operations there shall be permitted in the

                  specific use of said residence.
                  Each such land area shall be defined by permanent, physical markers and assigned an address in conformance
                  with the county's rural address system.
                  Each such land area shall have direct access to the public thoroughfare system.
                  Each such land area must meet with approval of Marion County Health Department as to suitability for
                  effective disposal of wastewater generated by occupants of the residence.

                  available to each nonprincipal/accessory residence.
                  Individual power supply sources shall be provided to each such land area and each power supply installation
                  shall meet such standards as have been adopted by local authorities.
                  Facilities established under this special provision for residential use shall meet the requirements of local
                  construction and use codes established by the board of commissioners.
                  Permits for construction shall not be issued by the zoning administrator until the applicant demonstrates the
                  ability to comply with each of the aforementioned conditions. In addition, any change in use or occupancy
                  must be approved by the zoning administrator.
                  Occupants of nonprincipal/accessory residences shall be:
                  Fulltime farm employees, or family members thereof, of [or] the property owner and responsible for
                  agricultural production of the property; or
                  Related by blood or legal ties to the owner of the property.
                  No commercial use of this special provision will be permitted.
                  No used mobile or manufactured home shall be allowed to locate for permanent or temporary occupancy in
                  this county if such mobile home is more than ten years old, title will be required. However, any mobile or

                  140/188
                  L.
                  manufactured home that is located in the county [that] will be affected by passage of the resolution from
                  which this section was derived and such owner/occupied existing mobile home shall be freely transferable and
                  relocated in the county, unless such existing mobile or manufactured home was manufactured prior to U.S.
                  Housing and Urban Development Department construction standards and has been inspected by the county
                  building inspection department to insure all windows, doors, smoke detectors, plumbing system, electrical
                  system, heating system and ventilation systems are in working order: the general appearance of the mobile or
                  manufactured home shall be acceptable with all siding and paneling in its proper place. However, outside

                  average elevation of the finished grade at the building's perimeter to the highest point on the building. This height limitation shall
                  not apply to chimneys, church spires, communication towers, cooling towers, elevator legs, grain elevators, silos, smokestacks,
                  water towers, windmills.
                  Sec. 4.05. - Substandard lots.

                  space, may be utilized for use for which it is herein zoned, provided the area of such yard or court in width, depth, or open space is
                  not less than 75 percent of that required by the terms of this chapter [appendix]. However, substandard lots in the rural residential
                  and agriculture districts are exempted from the 75 percent requirement. The purpose is to permit utilization of recorded lots which
                  lack adequate width or depth as long as reasonable living or working standards can be provided. Adjacent substandard lots under
                  the same ownership shall be combined, where possible, to make standard lots.
                  Sec. 4.06. - Substandard lots resulting from public dedication or condemnation.
                  In the event an undeveloped lot of record is reduced in size through an act of public dedication or condemnation for public
                  purposes, the development standards contained in this chapter [appendix] for width, depth, or area may be waived by the
                  planning commission and such property may be utilized for all permitted and, where authorized, conditional uses. Said waiver is
                  permissible only if the county health department determines that the health and general welfare of the lot owner and Marion
                  County will not be adversely affected by the intended use. Adjacent, undeveloped lots of record which are owned by the same
                  individual and which are affected by dedication or condemnation for public purposes shall be combined, where possible, to
                  standard lots.
                  Sec. 4.07. - Lot frontage.
                  Every lot shall front a public road. No building shall be erected on a parcel that does not abut a public street, or road, except as
                  otherwise provided herein.

                  No lot shall be reduced in size so that the yard, lot width, lot area or other requirements of this chapter [appendix] are not
                  maintained, except in cases where the size of a lot of record is reduced as a result of public dedication or condemnation for public
                  uses, and where such size reduction has been approved by the planning commission.
                  Sec. 4.10. - Accessory buildings.

                  No detached accessory building shall be located closer than 15 feet to any principal building.
                  Accessory buildings, except garages, may be erected in side yards and rear yards only, and shall not be nearer

                  area of the principal building.
                  In the case of corner lots, accessory buildings shall observe front yard requirements on both streets.

                  Sec. 4.12. - Protective screening.
                  In order to provide adequate protective screening for residential areas adjacent to or near nonresidential areas, the following
                  regulations shall apply:
                  Purpose and intent. The following regulations are designed to promote the health, safety, order, aesthetics
                  and general welfare by eliminating/reducing conflicts between incompatible uses of land, providing for a more
                  attractive environment, assuring adequate open space, and reducing noise, night lighting, odor, objectionable
                  views, loss of privacy and other adverse impacts and nuisances through the use of buffers and landscaping.
                  Buffer required.
                  Property zoned for office, commercial or industrial uses shall provide a buffer, as herein defined, along
                  any rear or side property lines abutting a residential district or abutting an alley across from a residential
                  district.
                  If the consensus of the planning commission is that the buffer would serve no good purpose, the buffer
                  requirement may be waived.

                  Where determined appropriate by the zoning administrator, existing vegetation may constitute all of the
                  required buffer, or be supplemented with approved, additional planting.
                  Vegetation, except for ground cover shall be of such type as to be a height of not less than four feet when
                  planted; provided that such plant materials can form a hardy screen, dense enough and high enough
                  both to interrupt vision and to reduce the transmission of sound and be of a type that will grow to a
                  height of at least six feet.
                  Landscape strip required.
                  The owner/developer of any:
                  Property zoned R-3.
                  Commercial zoned property which abuts an industrial zone.
                  Industrial zoned property which abuts a commercial zone.
                  Commercial or industrial zoned property which abuts a residential zone.
                  Conditional use commercial or conditional use industrial property shall provide landscape strips, as
                  herein defined, ten feet deep along the full length of the developed portion abutting any public
                  road, and five [feet] deep along the developed portion of side and rear property lines.
                  Acceptable plant material. In those instances where the natural vegetation and topography is insufficient
                  to achieve the desired level of screening as required by this chapter, a planted buffer shall be provided
                  and shall consist of plant material of such growth characteristics as will provide an acoustical and visual
                  screen. The following plants (excluding dwarf varieties) are approved for use in required buffers and
                  landscape strips.
                  Trees. Trees used for screening purposes should be native to the region and shall not be deciduous.
                  They shall be of a type that will grow to at least six feet. Acceptable types of trees include, but are
                  not limited to, the following:

                  aforementioned may be substituted, subject to approval of the zoning administrator prior to
                  installation. Planting of kudzu is prohibited. A grassed, earthen berm may be substituted, provided a
                  continuous visual screen, with or without acceptable shrub or hedge material, is formed at least six
                  feet in height. This option shall not create a drainage problem for the adjoining property whether
                  publicly or privately owned.
                  Maintenance of buffers and landscape strips. The owner/developer of the property shall be responsible for: (1)
                  installing the trees and shrubs and maintaining them in a neat and orderly appearance), (2) providing an
                  aesthetically pleasing appearance, and (3) assuring that the buffer actually serves the purpose for which it is
                  intended. In cases of noncompliance the zoning administrator shall be empowered to take action as provided
                  by law to ensure maintenance of all plant and landscaping materials.
                  Administration and enforcement. All site plans, plot plans, construction plans, and grading and drainage plans
                  shall indicate all required buffers and landscape strips. Required buffers and landscape strips shall be installed
                  in accordance with approved plans prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy.
                  General provisions.
                  Landscaping, fencing or walls shall be used to screen objectionable views or nuisances such as service
                  areas, refuse containers, air conditioning units, transformers, private water system tanks and wells, etc.
                  The exact location for walls and fences constructed pursuant to the requirements of this section shall be
                  determined on a case by case basis subject to approval of the zoning administrator. Such improvements
                  shall be a minimum of six feet high above grade elevation and constructed of materials approved by the
                  zoning administrators walls of brick, stone or concrete block textured or coated with an architectural
                  finish (paint, stucco, etc.); fences of wood or other material that achieves the desired visual and acoustical
                  screening with finished surface facing externally to the project.
                  Sec. 4.13. - Animals in residential districts.
                  [Intent.] It is the intent of this section to permit certain uses in R-1, R-2 and RR districts which involve the keeping of
                  limited numbers of domestic animals or pets where it is recognized that such areas are changing from agricultural

                  to suburban residential in character. This section is further intended to minimize problems which may arise from
                  such animal uses and to provide suitable standards for protection of health, safety, welfare and preservation of
                  residential districts from indiscriminate raising of animals.
                  Uses permitted.
                  Permitted use provisions for animals in residential districts are meant to apply only outside of the residence
                  on an individual lot and are not intended to restrict the type or number of animals within a residence.
                  The keeping of livestock fowl or domestic pets shall not be allowed to become a nuisance.
                  Domestic pets such as cats, dogs, rabbits or other generally recognized domestic pets may be kept or bred by
                  persons residing on the property for their use and enjoyment. The keeping of swine is specifically prohibited.
                  Livestock and fowl kept in any residential district shall be maintained at least 25 feet from any property line.
                  Conditional uses permitted: The following uses are allowed upon a conditional use permit granted by the board of
                  commissioners:
                  Livestock. Horses, cows, ponies, donkeys and other, similar domestic livestock may be kept, raised or bred for
                  home use and enjoyment; provided only one such animal shall be permitted for each two acres, exclusive of
                  the front and side yards of the principal dwelling; and all livestock shall be contained by fence within said
                  minimum area.
                  Fowl. Ducks, quail, chickens, turkeys, pigeons, pheasants, etc., may be raised for home use provided such fowl
                  are adequately contained within that property.
                  Uses prohibited. The keeping, breeding or training of any animals or fowl for monetary gain or profit shall be
                  deemed a commercial business and is expressly prohibited in all residential districts except where such operations
                  may qualify as a home occupation or as a nonconforming use as defined in this chapter [appendix]. The keeping of
                  swine is specifically prohibited.
                  Sec. 4.14. - Conditional uses.
                  Before a building permit shall be issued for a conditional use, application shall be made to the planning commission,
                  which, after careful review of any applicable sections of this chapter [appendix], may recommend to the board of
                  commissioners the issuance of such permit if, in the judgment of the planning commission, it will not be detrimental
                  to the health, safety and general welfare of the county.
                  An application to establish a conditional use shall be approved following a review by the planning commission and a
                  determination by the board of commissioners that:
                  The proposed use shall not be contrary to the purpose[s] of this chapter [appendix].
                  The proposed use shall not be detrimental to the use or development of adjacent properties or the general
                  neighborhood, nor affect adversely the health and safety of residents and workers.
                  The proposed use shall not constitute a nuisance or hazard because of the number of persons who will attend
                  or use such facility, vehicular movement noise or fume generation or type of physical activity.
                  The proposed use shall not be affected adversely by the existing uses, and the proposed use will be placed on
                  a lot of sufficient size to satisfy the space requirements of said use.
                  Parking and all development standards set forth for each particular use for which a permit may be granted
                  have been met.
                  The board of commissioners may impose or require additional restrictions and standards as may be necessary to
                  protect the health and safety of workers and residents in the community and to protect the value and use of
                  property in the general neighborhood. Whenever the board of commissioners shall find, in the case of any permit

                  permit after giving due notice to all parties concerned and granting full opportunity for a public hearing.
                  Sec. 4.15. - Variances.
                  The planning commission shall authorize, in specific cases, variances from the terms of this chapter [appendix] to
                  the extent said variances will not, in the opinion of the planning commission, be contrary to the public interest, and
                  where owing to special conditions a literal enforcement of this chapter [appendix] will, in an individual case, result in
                  unnecessary hardship. Variance may be granted in individual cases of unnecessary hardship upon a finding that:
                  There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question
                  because of its size, shape or topography;
                  The application of this chapter [appendix] to this particular piece of property would create an unnecessary
                  hardship;
                  Such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of property involved; and
                  Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public interest or impair the purposes and
                  intent of this chapter [appendix].
                  No variance may be granted for use of land or building that is prohibited by this chapter [appendix]. The county will
                  control the actual use of properties through zoning and conditional uses and not through variance.
                  In exercising the powers granted in subsection (a) of this section, the planning commission shall not consider any
                  nonconforming use of neighboring lands, structures or buildings in the same district, nor any permitted use of
                  lands, structures or buildings in other districts as grounds for the issuance of a variance.
                  If the planning commission grants a variance, the reason for such variance must be put forth clearly in the minutes
                  of the meeting at which the variance was granted.
                  A public hearing is required for all variances.
                  Sec. 4.16. - Special exceptions.
                  Prior to any uses being permitted as special exceptions, a request for a hearing before the planning commission must be
                  made and the following procedures shall be observed:
                  The owner of the real property involved shall submit an application in writing to the zoning administrator of
                  the owner's request for a special exception with a $100.00 fee. Such application shall include the street
                  address of the real property involved, the lot dimensions, a description of the structures on the real property,
                  fences, the names of the adjacent owners, the present zoning designation of the property involved and of the
                  property adjacent to the property involved; and such other information as the planning commission may
                  require.
                  The zoning administrator, upon receipt of an application for a special exception, shall, within three days from
                  receipt of such application, notify the chairperson of the planning commission and deliver a copy of such
                  application to said chairperson.
                  The zoning administrator shall cause to have posted in a conspicuous place on the property in question a sign
                  of not less than 12 square feet in area which shall contain information as to the proposed request for a special
                  exception and the date, time and place of the public hearing to be held by the planning commission. The
                  planning commission shall fix a reasonable time for a public hearing on the request for a special exception and
                  shall give at least 15 days public notice of the time and place of said hearing, to be published in the newspaper
                  of general circulation in the county.
                  The planning commission at said public hearing shall consider any testimony in favor of or opposed to said

                  request for a special exception and shall either grant or deny said request for a special exception at the
                  conclusion of said public hearing using the following standards:
                  The proposed use or structure shall be compatible with development and uses existing on adjacent and
                  nearby property.
                  The proposed use or structure shall not have a substantial adverse impact upon the existing use or
                  usability of adjacent or nearby property.
                  The proposed use or structure shall not cause an excessive or burdensome use of existing streets,
                  transportation facilities, utilities, schools or other public facilities.
                  Any other relevant factors, including the conformity of the proposed development with duly adopted land
                  use and other physical development plans or policies for the area, may also be considered.
                  Special exceptions granted by the planning commission shall be valid for a period of 12 months from date of
                  approval, shall not be transferable except upon written approval of the board of commissioners, and shall be
                  executed within the grant period or become null and void and subject to procedures for resubmission as
                  established in this section.
                  Said special exception, if granted by the planning commission, shall be granted only for the special exception
                  requested in the application and for no other purposes.
                  Sec. 4.17. - Site plan review.
                  In order to assure that the requirements of this chapter [appendix] are satisfied, all applications for a building
                  permit shall be accompanied by a building site plan which shall conform to the list of requirements, and be
                  reviewed by the zoning administrator to determine compliance with this chapter [appendix] before a building
                  permit is issued;
                  Site location map.
                  The site plan shall be drawn to a minimum scale of one inch equals 100 feet. The building official may request
                  that the plan be drawn by a registered engineer or surveyor certified to work in Georgia if questions of soil
                  suitability or flood zone locations exist within the property for which a building permit is being sought.
                  The plan shall show all property lines.
                  The plan shall show the complete outline of the proposed building at the location where it is proposed to be
                  built.
                  The plan shall show all required building setback lines: front, rear and sides. No part of any permanent
                  structure shall encroach on any required setbacks.
                  The plan shall show all required parking, landscape buffers and all other requirements as set out in this
                  chapter [appendix].
                  After the zoning administrator has reviewed the site plan, a letter stating approval/disapproval will be sent to the
                  building official.
                  Before inspection of the foundation, the builder shall run string connecting all the iron pins that define the corners
                  of the lot to create an outline of the lot on the ground.
                  At the time the building official conducts the foundation inspection, he will measure from the string determining the
                  property lines to the proposed outermost edge of the building to assure compliance with the requirements of this
                  chapter [appendix] as they pertain to required setbacks.
                  Sec. 4.18. - Landlls and waste disposal.
                  No landfills and/or waste disposal will be permitted by any county, individual and/or any other organization except

                  ARTICLE V. - R-1 SINGLE-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT
                  Sec. 5.01. - Statement of purpose.
                  The R-1 district is composed of certain areas having a single-family residential character and undeveloped land where it is
                  desirable and likely that similar development will occur. This district will be characterized by lot sizes designed for medium density
                  residential development. The specific purpose of this district is to:
                  Encourage the construction and continued use of land for single-family dwellings constructed on site;
                  Prohibit business, commercial or industrial use of the land, and prohibit any other use which would
                  substantially interfere with development or maintenance of single-family dwellings in the district;
                  Encourage the discontinuance of existing uses that would not be permitted as new uses under the provisions
                  of this chapter [appendix];
                  Discourage any land use which would generate traffic on minor or local roads, other than normal traffic to
                  serve residences on those roads;
                  Discourage any use which because of its size or character would create requirements and costs for public
                  services such as fire and police protection, water supply and sanitary sewerage substantially in excess of such

                  The RR district is composed of certain areas having both rural and single-family residential characteristics, and areas where it
                  is desirable and likely that similar development will occur in the future. The district is characterized by very low density of housing
                  and large lot sizes, as well as permitting uses that are associated with rural areas. It is designed to accommodate residential
                  development opportunities for those who desire exurban low-density, or estate living, and are willing to live in more remote
                  locations and to assume the costs of providing many of their own services and amenities. The public provision of these amenities is
                  limited because the county must concentrate its limited resources in areas where more intense future development is logical. The
                  sparse development allowed in this district is necessitated by the county's need to preserve and support existing public
                  infrastructure.
                  Sec. 8.02. - Permitted uses.
                  The following uses are permitted in the RR district:
                  Accessory building or use customarily incidental to any permitted use, when located on the same lot and not
                  involving any business, profession, trade or occupation, provided that all accessory buildings shall conform
                  and be located as required in section 4.10C.
                  Agricultural activities limited to row-crop and nut production, open grazing of livestock, horticulture and
                  silviculture.
                  Aquaculture.
                  Church, provided the proposed site is not less than three acres, and a complete site development plan is
                  submitted with the application for a building permit.
                  Home occupation.
                  Garden.
                  Guest home and servant quarters.
                  Keeping livestock and fowl on residential property for noncommercial purposes provided the following
                  requirements are met:
                  Horses, cows, ponies, donkeys and other domestic livestock may be kept, raised or bred for home use
                  and enjoyment; provided that only three such animals shall be permitted for each 50,000 square feet of
                  land area, not to include the front yard of the principal dwelling, and all livestock shall be adequately
                  fenced within the property.
                  Ducks, quail, chickens, turkeys, pigeons, pheasants, etc., may be raised for home use and enjoyment
                  provided that such fowl are adequately contained within the property.
                  The keeping, breeding or training of any animals for monetary gain or profit shall be deemed a
                  commercial business and is expressly prohibited in except where such operation may qualify as a home
                  occupation or as a nonconforming use.
                  No animal or fowl of any kind shall be kept on a lot in this district when there is no principal dwelling on
                  the lot.
                  Single-family, detached dwelling, including manufactured home.
                  Sec. 8.03. - Conditional uses.

                  ARTICLE XI. - AG AGRICULTURE DISTRICT
                  Sec. 11.01. - Statement of purpose.
                  The AG district is established for the purposes of:
                  Preserving, promoting, maintaining and enhancing the use of land for commercial agricultural purposes;
                  Stabilizing increases in public expenditures for such services as roads and road maintenance, police and fire
                  protection, and schools;
                  Protecting and preserving natural resource areas;
                  Preventing scattered and leap-frog non-farm growth.
                  This district is designed to protect and preserve prime agricultural areas for continued agricultural and agriculturally
                  oriented uses. The loss of this natural resource cannot be readily compensated, since these prime agricultural areas
                  are relatively scarce, particularly on the national level, and other areas require more capital, energy and
                  supplemental nutrients to provide equal productivity.
                  The standards and densities prescribed for this district are intended to preserve the open character of the area and
                  protect the business of agriculture. This district is intended not to regulate agricultural uses, but to regulate those

                  Sec. 11.04. - Conicts.
                  By their very nature, some agricultural activities generate noises, odors and insect pests which are detrimental to nearby land
                  uses/occupants. To the extent they are a function of the size of the specific agricultural activity, the adverse or negative efforts of
                  some of these noises, odors and insects can be mitigated somewhat by distance. For the purpose of mitigating said adverse and
                  negative impacts, minimum distances between agricultural activities and surrounding land uses are hereby established (sections
                  11.05 and 11.06) on the basis of low and high density agricultural operations.

                  Farm animal operations of sizes smaller or equal to the following thresholds are classified as low density:
                  Dairy cows 50
                  Sheep 100
                  Ducks 100

                  Poultry 150
                  Turkeys 150
                  All low density farm animal operations constructed or expanded adjacent to an existing, noncompatible land use
                  (e.g., residential) shall construct all buildings and fencing used for animal confinement (e.g., poultry house,
                  farrowing house) at least 150 feet from the centerline of an adjoining public road, and 200 feet from the property
                  line of the adjoining, non-compatible land use. Confinement fencing is not to be confused with boundary fencing,
                  the latter of which may be constructed along the right-of-way and property line. The area between confinement
                  fencing and boundary fencing may be used for row crop, vegetable or orchard production, or pasture. In the event
                  said area is used for pasture it shall not be stocked at a rate higher than recommended by generally accepted
                  animal husbandry practices for open grazing of the specific animal species. Where said area is grazed, fencing, as
                  necessary, shall be erected around any surface feature, e.g., bog, to prevent livestock from congregating along
                  boundary fencing adjacent to the property line of a noncompatible land use. Livestock catch pens shall be allowed
                  in the grazing area, provided the specific site does not retain water.
                  The site(s) used for temporary storage or treatment of any waste or by-product of a low density farm animal
                  operation shall be located at least 150 feet from the centerline of an adjoining public road, and at least 200 feet
                  from the property line of the adjoining, noncompatible land use.
                  Machinery and equipment used to ventilate animal confinement buildings must be installed in such a way that air
                  removed from said buildings is directed away from nearby development(s).
                  Any development proposed for a site adjacent to and not compatible with an existing low density farm animal
                  operation or row crop operation shall be constructed at least 150 feet from the centerline of the adjoining public
                  road when said development fronts the low density from animal operation or row crop operation, and 200 feet
                  from the adjoining property line, when said development is adjacent to the low density farm animal operation or
                  row crop operation.
                  Sec. 11.06. - High density farm animal operations.
                  Farm animal operations of sizes greater than the thresholds identified in section 11.05 (low density farm animal
                  operations) are classified as high density farm animal operations.

                  Term of office. The term of the members shall be for five years; except that in the appointment of the first planning
                  commission pursuant to this article, four of the members shall be appointed for three-year terms and three
                  members shall be appointed for five-year terms. Any vacancy in the membership shall be filled for the unexpired
                  term in the same manner as the initial appointment. However, the present planning commission members shall
                  serve until their present term expires and an appointment to that position is completed. The newly appointed shall
                  serve as provided in this paragraph.
                  Compensation. The planning commission members shall receive no compensation for their service except that they

                  assistance as is needed by the board to carry out its function under the provisions of these regulations.
                  Rules of procedures. The planning commission shall make its own rules of procedure and shall determine its time of
                  meetings. All meetings of the planning commission at which official action shall be taken shall be open to the public
                  and all records of the planning commission shall be public records and shall be kept in the custody of the county
                  clerk. The planning commission shall review each application in light of the county's comprehensive plan, the zoning
                  criteria, and other facts presented at their meeting and issue a finding which recommends approval" or "denial" of
                  the application. The zoning administrator will prepare a report on each application to assist the planning
                  commission in their decision-making process. The planning commission finding shall be forwarded as a
                  recommendation to the board of commissioners.
                  Powers and duties. The planning commission is hereby vested with all the powers, duties and responsibilities

                  notification sign shall be maintained at all times by the zoning administrator until a decision has been made by the
                  board of commissioners, then removed.
                  Newspaper advertisement. Not less than 15 days nor more than 45 days prior to the schedule date of the public
                  hearing, and pursuant to state law, a notice of public hearing shall be published in the legal organ of the county.
                  Such notice shall state the application file number, and shall contain a summary of the proposed amendment in the
                  case of a text amendment, and the location of the property, its area, owner, the current zoning classification, and
                  the proposed classification in the case of a map amendment.
                  Sec. 23.04. - Public hearing process.
                  Notice to interested parties. A notice shall be delivered to the applicant and the planning commission, of the date,
                  time, and place of hearing. All application files shall be placed in the custody of the zoning administrator and shall
                  be open to public inspection during regular office hours.
                  Hearing procedure.
                  Upon the completion of a rezoning application, waiver, variance, denial of building permit, denial of conditional
                  use, denial of any request made to the zoning administration or planning commission, nonenforcement of
                  zoning laws, or the draft of a text amendment, public hearings will be scheduled by the planning commission
                  and the county commission respectively. The official public hearing required by state law will be held by the
                  board of commissioners, and public notice will be given no less than 15 days nor more than 45 days prior to
                  the official public hearing date.
                  All public hearings on zoning matters shall be placed on the presiding commission's agenda under section
                  entitled "Public Hearings." After an initial presentation of a specific zoning request to the presiding commission
                  by the designated county staff, citizen comments will be heard in an orderly fashion. The presiding
                  commission's chairperson or designated representative will ask for those citizens speaking in favor of the
                  request first, followed by those opposed to the issue.
                  Citizens shall be requested to keep their comments as brief as possible so all who wish to be heard will have
                  adequate opportunity to speak. When there is a large number of citizens wishing to testify at a given hearing,
                  the presiding officer may invoke time limitations on individual speakers; however, the time limitation is not to
                  be less than ten minutes per side. In such cases, these time limits shall apply to all speakers.
                  Citizens shall address their comments to the presiding commission as a whole. Attacks on individuals or cross
                  examination of commission members, county employees or other citizens will be ruled out of order.
                  After all citizen comments have been received, further discussion of the specific application is reserved for the
                  presiding commission. The commission has the privilege to ask any questions of staff or any citizen present for
                  clarification.
                  If the planning commission is presiding over the hearing members may then vote on the application for a map
                  or text amendment and forward the recommendation to the board of commissioners.
                  At the official public hearing in front of the board of commissioners, the board of commissioners can close the
                  public hearing and vote on the application at the next regular voting session.
                  Information on speakers. All speakers will be required to provide their name and address for the public record, and
                  sign a campaign disclosure form. This form requires all those speaking in favor of, or in opposition to a rezoning to
                  disclose whether they have made campaign contributions aggregating $250.00 or more to any member of the board
                  of commissioners within the past two years. Such disclosure shall include the name of the commissioner(s), the
                  dollar amount, description and date of each such campaign contribution.
                  Public hearings records standards.

                  public hearing shall be noted as such and shall become a permanent part of the particular zoning
                  amendment's file.
                  Sec. 23.05. - Standards for exercise of zoning powers.
                  In order to provide for the public health, safety, morality and general welfare of the citizens of the county, the following zoning
                  criteria are established. The following criteria, the recommendation of the planning commission and any other factors relevant to
                  balancing the public interest, shall be considered by the board of commissioners in making any zoning decision:
                  Will the zoning proposal permit a use that is suitable in view of the use, development and zoning of adjacent
                  and nearby property?
                  What is the effect on the property value of the subject property should the existing zoning be retained?
                  If denied, will the effect on the applicant's property value under the existing zoning be offset by the gain to the
                  health, safety, morals or general welfare of the public?
                  Has the property been undeveloped an unusual length of time as currently zoned, considered in the context of
                  land development in the area in the vicinity of the property?
                  Will the zoning proposal result in a use that will or could cause an excessive or burdensome use of existing
                  streets, transportation facilities, schools, police protection, fire protection, public health facilities or emergency
                  medical services?
                  Is the zoning proposal in conformity with the policy and intent of the future land use plan for the physical
                  development of the area?
                  Is the subject property well suited for the proposed zoning purpose?
                  Will the zoning proposal adversely affect the existing use or usability of adjacent or nearby property?
                  Does the subject property have a reasonable economic use as currently zoned?
                  Are there other existing or changing conditions affecting the use or development of the subject property which
                  give supporting grounds for either approval or disapproval of the zoning proposal?
                  Would the change create an isolated district unrelated to the surrounding district such as "spot zoning"?
                  Are the present zoning district boundaries illogically drawn in relation to existing conditions in the area?
                  Is the change requested out of scale with the needs of the county as a whole or the immediate neighborhood?
                  Is it impossible to find adequate sites for the proposed use in districts permitting such use and already
                  appropriately zoned?
                  Would there be an ecological or pollution resulting from the proposed zoning if it is granted?
                  Sec. 23.06. - Reserved.
                  Sec. 23.07. - Duties of zoning administrator, county commission and courts on matters of appeal.
                  Zoning administrator. It is the intent of these regulations that the zoning administrator be chiefly responsible, with
                  due assistance from the county attorney, for all questions of interpretation of these regulations. The zoning
                  administrator shall also be responsible for the enforcement of these regulations, and shall have the authority to
                  issue summons to persons or other legal entities which violate any of the provisions of this and any other zoning
                  ordinance of Marion County, Georgia.
                  County commission. It is further the intent of these regulations that the duties of the county commission shall be to
                  adopt or reject proposed amendments to these regulations as detailed in section 23.01. Matters of nonenforcement

                  of this ordinance may be brought to the county commission's attention by aggrieved parties only after the aggrieved
                  party has followed the complaint procedure outlined in section 24.02(B). Corrections to problems of
                  nonenforcement shall be handled by the board of commissioners. Recourse from all decisions of the county
                  commission shall be to the courts as provided by law.
