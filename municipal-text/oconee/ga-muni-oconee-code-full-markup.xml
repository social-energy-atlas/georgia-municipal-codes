PREFACE 
</p>
        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE                   This Code constitutes a codification of the general and permanent ordinances of the Oconee County, Georgia. 
                  Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances and resolutions adopted by the board of commissioners. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of any subsequent ordinance or resolution included herein. 
                  The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
                  Chapter and Section Numbering System 
                  The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
                  Page Numbering System 
                  The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

                   
                  Index 
                  The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
                  Looseleaf Supplements 
                  A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
                  Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
                  Acknowledgments 
                  This publication was under the direct supervision of Daniel F. Walker, Supervising Legal Editor, and Francine King, Tech Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
                  The publisher is most grateful to Melvin Davis, Chairman; Gina Lindsey, County Clerk; and Daniel Haygood, County Attorney for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the county readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the county's affairs.

                  SUPPLEMENT HISTORY TABLE 
                    
                  The table below allows users of this Code to quickly and accurately determine what ordinances have been considered for codification in each supplement. Ordinances that are of a general and permanent nature are codified in the Code Book and are considered "Includes." Ordinances that are not of a general and permanent nature are not codified in the Code Book and are considered "Omits." 
                  In addition, by adding to this table with each supplement, users of this Code will be able to gain a more complete picture of the Code's historical evolution.

                  Sec. 1-11. - Causing, permitting, abetting or concealing prohibited act. 
                  Whenever in the resolutions or ordinances of the county any act or omission is made unlawful, it shall include causing, allowing, permitting, aiding, abetting, suffering or concealing the fact of such act or omission. 
                  Sec. 1-12. - Construction of provisions.

                  (b)  When a resolution or ordinance which repealed another shall itself be repealed, the previous resolution or ordinance shall not be revived without express words to that effect. 
                  Sec. 1-14. - Matters not affected by Code. 
                  Nothing in this Code or the resolution or ordinance adopting this Code shall be construed to repeal or otherwise affect the validity of any of the following:

For example, the codifier may: 
                  (1)  Organize the resolution or ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions. 
                  (2)  Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles. 
                  (3)  Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the Code and, where necessary to accommodate new material, change existing section or other subdivision numbers. 
                  (4)  Change the words "this resolution" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case may be, or to "sections _____ to _____" (inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of the resolution or ordinance incorporated into the Code). 
                  (5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meanings of resolution or ordinance sections inserted into the Code; but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of resolution material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code.

                  Exhibit D  Budget Process

                  The prospective budget submittal plan for the upcoming fiscal year will be distributed to the board during the fourth week of January. A budget submittal plan sets milestones and target dates for each budget event and/or task. 
                  The budget request forms are then distributed to each elected official and department director during the second week of February. The budget forms are data collection documents. Each elected official and department director shall complete anticipated revenue and expenditures for the upcoming fiscal year, taking into account past fiscal year results and future fiscal year needs and desires. A complete set of departmental forms are provided for the board of commissioners at this time and will be updated throughout the budget process. 
                  Preliminary budget discussions with the finance director occur between elected officials/department directors during the first week of March. This meeting is in an informal setting, usually in the finance director's office, with various finance department personnel also in attendance. These are a series of scheduled meetings with elected officials/department directors during the course of the week. Attendance from each elected official and department director is mandatory. The various commissioners' attendance (maximum of two at one time) is based on a predetermined schedule. These meetings facilitate open discussion for individual departmental needs/desires for the upcoming year, allowing for direct input from commissioners and open feedback. 
                  The elected officials and department directors meet during the second week of March in the chairman of the board of commissioner's office with the chairman of the board of commissioners, county administrative officer and finance director. All budget requests are reviewed and considered at this time. Commissioners will be notified of these meetings and one commissioner in addition to the chairperson will be given the opportunity to attend. 
                  All budget request forms are returned to the board of commissioners via the finance department during the third week of March. This is a deadline, more so than a milestone. The budget request forms should be all inclusive, taking into account revenue and expenditures for the General Fund, Capitol Projects, SPLOST and all special revenue. The commissioner's budget notebooks are updated at this time in preparation for public hearings. 
                  Public hearings with the board of commissioners are held during the second week of april. These hearings typically require three days to complete. This is the first opportunity for public comment on the upcoming fiscal year budget. Each elected official/department director is afforded the opportunity to discuss their specific budget request in an open public forum. 
                  The board of commissioners performs an internal review and/or consideration of the fiscal year budget during the third and fourth weeks of April. It is during this review period, that the comprehensive budget for the upcoming fiscal year is balanced. 
                  The final proposed fiscal year budget is submitted to the board of commissioners from the finance director during the second week of May. The budget will be balanced with revenues matching expenditures. 
                  There are two required public hearings on the proposed budget for the upcoming fiscal year. The first public hearing is held during the third week of May. This is the first opportunity for the public to comment on the proposed fiscal year budget as a balanced document, meaning revenues and expenditures are in balance. During this meeting, the board of commissioners tentatively schedules the budget for adoption. The second public hearing is scheduled for a 6:30[p.m.] called meeting. During this public hearing, the finance director will propose the balanced budget to the board of commissioners and the public for the second time. 
                  At the regularly scheduled board meeting in June, scheduled the first Tuesday in June, the board of commissioners is scheduled to adopt the proposed budget as the official budget for the upcoming fiscal year, which begins July 1.

                  (Ord. of 3-4-2003, § 1) 
                  Secs. 8-20—8-41. - Reserved. 
                  ARTICLE III. - ADULT ENTERTAINMENTS 

                  Sec. 8-42. - Findings and purpose. 
                  (a)  Based on the experiences of other counties and municipalities, including, but not limited to, Austin, Texas and Garden Grove, California, which experiences are found to be relevant to the problems faced by the county; and based on the documentary evidence and oral testimony presented by a law enforcement professional and an expert in economic development, both of whom are familiar with conditions resulting in other localities, at the board of commissioners' hearing on January 28, 2003, and based on the evidence and testimony of persons who have appeared before members of the board of commissioners on other occasions and on documentary evidence submitted to the board of commissioners, the board of commissioners takes note of the well-known and self-evident conditions and secondary effects attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among the various communities within our country. 
                  (b)  It is the finding of the board of commissioners of the county that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in establishments offering live nude entertainment or "adult entertainment," (whether such alcoholic beverages are sold on the premises or not) begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. In the same manner, establishments offering cinematographic or videographic adult entertainment have the same deleterious effects on the community. 
                  (c)  Among the acts of criminal behavior found to be associated with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, live commercial nudity in general, and cinematographic or videographic adult entertainment are disorderly conduct, prostitution, public solicitation, public indecency, drug use and drug trafficking. Among the undesirable community conditions identified in other communities with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, commercial nudity in general, and cinematographic or videographic adult entertainment are depression of property values and acceleration of community blight in the surrounding neighborhood, increased allocation of and expenditure for law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, and increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior herein above described. The board of commissioners finds it is reasonable to believe that some or all of these undesirable community conditions will result in the county, as well. 
                  (d)  Furthermore, it is the finding of the board of commissioners that other forms of adult entertainment including, but not limited to, adult book stores, adult novelty shops, adult video stores, peep shows, adult theaters, and massage parlors have an adverse effect upon the quality of life in surrounding communities. 
                  (e)  The board of commissioners finds that the negative secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments upon the county are similar whether the adult entertainment establishment features live nude dancing or sells video tapes depicting sexual activities. In addition, the board of commissioners has been made aware of Gwinnett County's experience with the adult bookstore located within the county on Jimmy Carter Boulevard which has shown that a substantial amount of activity at that bookstore involves booths which an individual may enter, view videos depicting sexual activity, and sexually interact with a bookstore patron in an adjoining booth through a hole strategically placed in the wall of adjoining booths. 
                  (f)  The board of commissioners of the county, therefore finds that it is in the best interests of the health, welfare, safety and morals of the community and the preservation of its businesses, neighborhoods, and of churches, schools, residential areas, public parks and children's day care facilities to prevent or reduce the adverse impacts of adult entertainment establishments. Therefore, the board of commissioners of the county finds that licensing and regulations are necessary for any adult entertainment establishment. The board finds that these regulations promote the public welfare by furthering legitimate public and governmental interests, including but not limited to, reducing criminal activity and protecting against or eliminating undesirable community conditions and further finds that such will not infringe upon the protected Constitutional rights of freedom of speech or expression. To that end, this article is hereby adopted.

                  (a)  Declaration of unserviceability .

If the installation of the wireless facility requires a new pole or other new structure for its installation the fee shall be $1,000.00. 
                  (d)  Penalties . 
                  (1)  In the event of a violation of this section, the penalties unless otherwise specified in this section shall be as set forth state law for the violation of a county ordinance. 
                  (2)  In addition to those penalties set forth in state law, and distinct and separate from such penalties, a failure to comply with the requirements of this section with regard to one or more particular permits shall be grounds for suspension or revocation of such permit. The county shall first notify the permit holder in writing of the violation, which shall specify the nature of the violation and that the violation must be corrected within 14 days of the date of the postmark of the notice, or of the date of personal service of the notice, whichever is earlier. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this subsection or any other section of this section, if the violation causes, creates or presents an imminent danger or threat to the health or safety of lives or property, the county may, at its sole discretion, order the violation remedied within 24 hours. If the permit holder fails to either remedy the violation within the prescribed timeframe, or provide assurance, to the satisfaction of the county, that the permit holder will diligently remedy the violation within a reasonable time, the county may immediately revoke the permit, and shall promptly notify the permit holder of such revocation. 
                  (3)  In the event that the county finds a pattern of repeated and pervasive violations by a permit holder, the county may, following a hearing at which the permit holder shall be given an opportunity to be heard, suspend or revoke all permits held by a permit holder. 
                  (e)  Action on permit applications . 
                  (1)  The county shall review the application for a small cell wireless infrastructure permit in light of its conformity with applicable regulations of this section and applicable standards, and shall process the application on nondiscriminatory terms and conditions subject to the following requirements: 
                  a.  Within ten days of receiving an application, the county must determine and notify the applicant whether the application is complete; or if an application is incomplete, the county must specifically identify the missing information. 
                  b.  Under normal circumstances, the county will make its final decision to approve or deny the application within 60 days of the county's determination that the application is complete. 
                  c.  The county shall advise the applicant in writing of its final decision, and in the final decision document the basis for a denial, supported by substantial written evidence. 
                  (2)  Consolidated application. An applicant seeking to construct, modify or replace a network of small cell wireless facilities may, at the applicant's discretion, file a consolidated application and receive a single permit for multiple small cell wireless facilities, provided however, the county's denial of any site or sites within a single application shall not affect other sites submitted in the same application. The county shall grant a permit for any and all sites in a single application that it does not deny subject to the requirements of this section. 
                  (f)  Small cell wireless facilities in the ROW; maximum height; other requirements . 
                  (1)  Maximum size . Unless a waiver is granted for good cause shown, the height of new or modified small cell wireless facilities, or related utility poles or wireless support structures, installed in the rights-of-way shall not exceed 50 feet above preexisting grade. 
                  (2)  Appearance . All small cell wireless facilities shall utilize stealth technology unless the applicant can satisfactorily demonstrate to the county that the proposed installation, or set of installations, within the rights-of-way will not materially detract from the streetscape, landscape, skyline, beauty, or aesthetic interests of Oconee County. In making such a determination, the county may consider such factors as: 
                  a.  The nature of the proposed installation, including the size and appearance of individual facilities, the number and density of proposed facilities, and existing facilities in the area; 
                  b.  The character of the surrounding area, including whether it possesses particular historic or scenic interest, or is a residential neighborhood; 
                  c.  Whether the installation would have an unreasonable adverse effect on surrounding property values; 
                  d.  The applicant's plans for future development; 
                  e.  Public comments; and 
                  f.  All other utilities have been required to be placed underground. 
                  (3)  First-in-time access . Access to a particular space within the ROW shall be authorized on a first-come-first-served basis, corresponding to the date upon which an application is deemed complete by the county. 
                  (4)  Commencement of work . The permit shall be voidable by the county unless in the county's determination the work is commenced within 180 days from the date of issuance of the permit, unless extended by the county. If the facility is not used for its intended use within 12 months from the date of permit issuance, the county may revoke the permit. 
                  (5)  Collocation on traffic control facility mast arms . No small cell wireless facility may be located on the mast arm or foundation of a structure used to support traffic control facilities and equipment. 
                  (6)  Co-location . A small cell wireless facility shall be located on an existing structure in the rights-of-way, unless the applicant can demonstrate that no such location opportunities exist, considering the factors set forth in subparagraph a. below. The applicant may apply for an administrative variance from this requirement and seek placement of a new small cell wireless support structure within the rights-of-way, pursuant to subparagraph b. below. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as requiring any owner of existing facilities to share an antenna or any other wireless facility or wireless support structure with an applicant. 
                  a.  Factors demonstrating no co-location. 
                  1.  No existing poles or structures are located within the geographic area that can potentially meet applicant's bona fide engineering and service requirements; 
                  2.  Existing poles or structures are not of sufficient height to meet applicant's requirements; 
                  3.  Existing poles or structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support applicant's proposed wireless facility, and no alternate wireless facility requiring less structural strength and that would meet applicant's requirements are reasonably available; 
                  4.  The applicant's proposed wireless facility would cause electromagnetic interference with the existing wireless facilities on the existing tower or structure, or existing wireless facilities on the existing pole or structure would cause interference with the applicant's proposed wireless facility; 
                  5.  The fees, costs, or contractual provisions required by the owner in order to share an existing pole or structure, or to adapt an existing pole or structure for sharing, are unreasonable; or 
                  6.  Other limiting factors exist that render existing poles and structures unsuitable. 
                  b.  Administrative variance. In applying for an administrative variance to allow a new wireless support structure, the review process, including timelines, shall be in accordance with 47 U.S.C. § 332(c)(7) of the Federal Communications Act, as amended, and the FCC rules interpreting same, as well as the consideration of the following additional factors by the county to determine if the administrative variance is appropriate: 
                  1.  Demonstrated need for the applicant's proposed small cell technologies within the geographic area requested in order to deliver adequate wireless service. 
                  2.  Proof that all co-location sites in the area of need were pursued and have been denied; or that there does not exist the ability to co-locate using existing structures. The applicant must demonstrate all actions taken to achieve co-location. 
                  3.  The character of the area in which the small cell wireless support structure is requested, including evidence of surrounding properties and uses. 
                  4.  Stealth technology, if any, proposed to be utilized by the applicant, or proof that stealth technology is either unnecessary or cannot be used. 
                  5.  Proof that the proposed wireless support structure is the minimal physical installation which will achieve the applicant's goals. 
                  (7)  No interference . Wireless infrastructure shall not interfere in any manner with the existence and operation of any and all public and private rights of way, sanitary sewers, water mains, storm drains, gas mains, poles, aerial, and underground electrical and telephone wires, electroliers, cable television, and other telecommunications, utility, or county property. 
                  (8)  Concealed wiring . All electrical wiring shall be concealed within the structure. If this is unattainable, then a covering of the same color as the structure shall be used to conceal the wiring. 
                  (9)  Electrical power . The acquisition of electrical power shall be the sole responsibility of the permit holder. All electrical power shall be provided by underground utilities where feasible. 
                  (10)  Undergrounding . Applicant shall comply with nondiscriminatory undergrounding requirements that prohibit electric utilities, telecommunications and cable providers from installing utility poles or wireless support structures in the ROW without prior zoning approval in areas zoned for single family residential use, provided that such requirements shall not prohibit the replacement of existing structures. 
                  (11)  Facilities . When needed to supplement the information in its files, the county may request additional information about a specific facility of an applicant. Each applicant shall respond to such request in a reasonable and timely manner and based on information it maintains in the ordinary course of business. Additionally, when a state of emergency has been declared by the appropriate state or federal officials, each applicant shall work in good faith to provide facility information. 
                  (12)  Radiofrequency and electromagnetic frequency emissions . The permit holder shall at all times and in the manner specified by the county certify that it complies with all FCC rules and requirements relating to radiofrequency propagation and avoidance of interference. 
                  a.  The permit holder is solely responsible for the emissions of its wireless facilities, and for ensuring that any exposure from its emissions is within the limits permitted under all applicable rules of the FCC. To the extent required by FCC rules a permit holder shall install appropriate signage to notify workers and third parties of the potential for exposure to RF emissions. 
                  b.  Mitigation. To avoid exposure to radio frequency electromagnetic fields by persons working on or in close proximity to wireless facilities, and for emergency situations affecting public safety, an applicant shall implement a process, subject to the county's prior review and approval, through which the applicant's wireless facility may be turned off manually by the county, its employees or contractors, and first responders, through means of a disconnect switch reasonably accessible to such persons. 
                  (13)  Maintenance of facilities . A permit holder shall make and maintain all wireless infrastructure installed in the ROW in safe condition and good repair. Cabinets, facilities, wires and other equipment shall not appear to be unkempt. Maintenance and replacement of wireless facilities shall be performed by the permit holder or by an approved contractor at no cost to the county. 
                  (14)  Minimizing impacts on adjacent property owners . 
                  a.  A permit holder shall design and install wireless infrastructure so as to minimize any impact on the immediately adjacent property owners, and shall be required to mitigate any unreasonable adverse impacts relating to visibility from the adjacent property; access to and from the adjacent property; and intrusion of light, sound, or smell. 
                  (15)  Appeal . A denial of an application for permit, or revocation of existing permit, shall entitle the applicant or permit holder to a hearing before the board of commissioners within 21 days after receipt by the county of written notice of appeal, which must be delivered to the clerk of the Oconee County Commission within 30 days of such denial or revocation. The county must issue its written decision within 15 days of the hearing. Any person aggrieved by such decision shall have the right to appeal in accordance with law. 
                  (g)  Effect of permit . 
                  (1)  Authority granted . A permit from the county authorizes an applicant to undertake only certain activities in accordance with this section, and does not create a property right or grant authority to the applicant to impinge upon the rights of others who may already have an interest in the rights-of way. The right to install wireless infrastructure at a particular location shall include the right to reasonably access such facility, including but not limited to on foot and by vehicle, to connect such facility to electrical power and telecommunications service, to maintain such facility, and to upgrade and modify such facility, in accordance with requirements of the county and applicable standards. Permitted facilities must at all times serve a lawful purpose, and the use of such facilities must comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws and applicable standards. 
                  (2)  Duration . No permit issued under this section shall be valid for a period longer than ten years. Nothing in this subsection prevents any permit from being renewed. 
                  (3)  Reservation of county authority . The county at all times reserves the right to take any action it deems necessary, in its sole discretion, to repair, maintain, alter, or improve any site within the rights-of-way where wireless infrastructure is installed, as may be necessary and in keeping with the health, welfare and safety of the public. Such actions may temporarily interfere with the operation of a wireless facility. The county will give the permit holder 30 days written notification of such planned, non-emergency actions that are reasonably likely to interfere with the operation of a wireless facility. In the event of an emergency the county shall endeavor to give the owner notice within 24 hours of such action. 
                  (4)  No franchise or approval to provide cable service, or other services . A permit issued under this section does not constitute a license or franchise to provide cable service as defined in Section 602 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. § 522(6), nor any other service for which a franchise or other approval is required. 
                  (5)  Failure to exercise access rights . If a permit holder does not diligently exercise any access right granted pursuant to an applicable permit(s) within 120 days of the effective date of such permit (unless such time period is extended in writing), the county may, but shall have no obligation to, use the permitted space in the public right-of-way for its own needs, make the space available to other entities, or for other purposes. If a wireless facility is not used for its intended use within 12 months from the date of permit issuance, the county may revoke the permit 30 days after providing notice to the permit holder of the county's intent to revoke, provided the permit holder submits no sufficient proof of use, to the county's satisfaction, within such 30-day period. 
                  (h)  Removal, relocation or modification of wireless infrastructure . 
                  (1)  Removal for county improvement . Within 90 days following written notice from the county, a permit holder shall, at its own expense, protect, support, temporarily or permanently disconnect, remove, relocate, change or alter the position of any of its permitted wireless infrastructure within the rights-of-way if the county has determined that such removal, relocation, change or alteration is reasonably necessary for the construction, repair, maintenance, or installation of any county improvement in or upon, or the operations of the county in or upon, the rights-of-way. The county will work in good faith with the permit holder to identify and promptly approve one or more acceptable alternate locations for any permitted facilities that are removed, relocated, changed, or altered pursuant to this subparagraph. 
                  (2)  Removal for noncompliance . The county may remove permitted wireless infrastructure after 45 days following a permit revocation described in Section 4 (B) of this section. 
                  (3)  Emergency removal or relocation of facilities . The county retains the right and privilege to cut or move any wireless infrastructure located within the ROW, as the county may determine to be necessary, appropriate or useful in response to any public health or safety emergency. If circumstances allow, the county shall notify the permit holder and provide the permit holder a reasonable opportunity to move its own wireless infrastructure prior to cutting or removing a facility and shall notify the permit holder after cutting or removing wireless infrastructure. 
                  (4)  Abandonment of facilities . The permit holder shall notify the county within 90 days of any abandonment of a wireless infrastructure for which a permit has been issued under this section. The county may also determine that wireless infrastructure is abandoned in fact, following a reasonable investigation and failure of the permit holder to respond to written communication within 30 days. In the event of abandonment, the county may direct the permit holder to remove all or any portion of the wireless infrastructure if the county, or any of its departments, determines that such removal will be in the best interest of the public health, safety and welfare. If permit holder does not remove facilities as directed within a reasonable period of time, the county may remove such facilities, and shall be entitled to obtain reimbursement from the permit holder for the county's actual cost in effecting such removal. Facilities removed by the county will be held, maintained, and disposed in accordance with applicable law. 
                  (5)  Removal . The county shall notify the permit holder in writing within ten days of any removal of wireless infrastructure by the County under this section. 
                  (i)  ROW rates—Annual rate . An applicant authorized to place small cell wireless infrastructure in the ROW shall pay to the county compensation for use of the ROW in the amount of $250.00 annually per permitted small cell wireless facility. 
                  (j)  Attachment to county-owned utility poles in the ROW . 
                  (1)  No grant of attachment rights . A permit issued under this section does not confer any right to attach wireless facilities to county-owned or privately-owned utility poles or wireless support structures, which applicant acknowledges must be obtained through attachment agreements or similar documents with the county or such private pole or structure owner. The county may cause a permit under this section to be made temporary or conditional upon the applicant's demonstration of its attachment rights for the particular pole or structure in question. 
                  (2)  Make-ready . For county-owned utility poles in the rights-of-way, the county shall provide a good faith estimate for any make-ready work necessary to enable the pole to support the requested small cell wireless facility, including pole replacement if necessary, within 30 days after receipt of a completed request. 
                  (k)  Relief . Any applicant desiring relief or exemption from any aspect or requirement of this section may request such from the board of commissioners at a pre-application meeting, provided that the relief or exemption is contained in the original application, or in the case of an existing or previously approved application a request for alteration of its proposed facilities. Such relief may be temporary or permanent, partial or complete, at the sole discretion of the board of commissioners. However, the burden of proving the need for the requested relief or exemption is solely on the applicant to prove. The applicant shall bear all costs in considering the request and the relief shall not be transferable to a new or different holder of the permit or owner of the facilities without the specific written permission of the board of commissioners. No such relief or exemption shall be approved unless the applicant demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that, if granted, the relief or exemption will have no significant detrimental effect on the health, safety and welfare of the county, its residents and other service providers. 
                  (l)  Other provisions . 
                  (1)  Indemnification . Any application for a permit pursuant to this section shall contain a provision with respect to indemnification. Such provision shall require the applicant, to at all times defend, indemnify, protect, save, hold harmless, and exempt the county, and its officers, employees, committee members, attorneys, agents, and consultants from any and all liabilities, judgments, penalties, damages, costs, charges and cost of defense arising out of any and all claims, suits, demands, causes of action, or award of damages, whether compensatory or punitive, or expenses arising therefrom, either at law or in equity, which arise or might arise directly or indirectly out of, or are caused by, the placement, construction, erection, alteration, location, products performance, use, operation, maintenance, repair, installation, replacement, removal, or restoration of said wireless infrastructure. With respect to the liabilities, judgments, penalties, damages costs, charges and cost of defense referenced herein, these include, but are not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees, consultants' fees, and expert witness fees. 
                  (2)  Insurance . 
                  a.  A permit holder shall secure and at all times maintain the following insurance coverages covering wireless infrastructure permitted under this section: 
                  1.  Commercial general liability insurance covering personal injuries, death and property damage: $1,000,000.00 per occurrence/$2,000,000.00 aggregate.

                  b.  The commercial general liability insurance policy shall specifically include the county and its officers, employees, committee members, attorneys, agents and consultants as additional named insureds. 
                  c.  The insurance policies shall be issued by an agent or representative of an insurance company licensed and in good standing to do business in the state and with a best's rating of at least A. The insurance policies shall contain an endorsement obligating the insurance company to furnish the county with at least 30 days prior written notice in advance of the cancellation of the insurance. 
                  d.  Renewal or replacement policies or certificates shall be delivered to the county at least 15 days before the expiration of the insurance which such policies are to renew or replace. 
                  e.  The applicant shall provide a copy of each of the policies or certificates of insurance representing the insurance in the required amounts. 
                  f.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, an applicant shall have the right to self-insure the coverages required by this subsection b. as long as it or its parent company maintains a net worth of at least $300,000,000.00. 
                  (3)  Assignment . A permit holder shall not assign its rights or obligations under any permit, nor any part of such rights or obligations, without the prior written consent of the county, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a permit holder may, without the consent of the county and following 30 days' prior written notice to the county, assign its rights and obligations under any permit to any person or entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the permit holder. In both instances, the assignee must demonstrate to the county compliance with all provisions of this section, specifically including, without limitation, subsections (l)(1), (2). 
                  (4)  Receivership, foreclosure or act of bankruptcy . 
                  a.  The right ta use the rights-of way granted hereunder to a permit holder shall, at the option of the county, cease and terminate 120 days after the filing of bankruptcy or the appointment of a receiver or receivers or trustee or trustees to take over and conduct the business of the permit holder whether in a receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy or other action or proceeding unless such receivership or trusteeship shall have been vacated prior to the expiration of said 120 days, or unless such receivers or trustees shall have, within 120 days after their election or appointment, fully complied with all the terms and provisions of this section. 
                  b.  In the case of foreclosure or other judicial sale of the plant, property and equipment of a permit holder, or any part thereof, the county may serve notice of termination upon the permit holder and the successful bidder at such sale, in which event any permit granted under this section shall cease and terminate 30 days after service of such notice, unless: a) the county shall have approved the transfer of a permit to the successful bidder, and b) such successful bidder shall have covenanted and agreed with the county to assume and be bound by all the terms and conditions of the permit.

The finance director shall, after such registration, issue without charge a certificate of authority to each operator to collect the tax from the occupant.

                  (d)  Except in the case of failure to make a return, every notice of a deficiency determination shall be mailed within three years after the 20th day of the calendar month following the monthly period for which the amount is proposed to be determined or within three years after the return is filed, whichever period should last expire.

                  Whenever the amount of any tax or interest has been paid more than once or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by Oconee County under this chapter, it may be offset by the finance director. If the operator or person determines that he or she has overpaid or paid more than once, which fact has not been determined by the finance director, he or she will have three years from the date of payment to file a claim in writing stating the specific ground upon which the claim is founded. The claim shall be audited. If the claim is approved by the finance director, the excess amount paid Oconee County may be credited on any amounts then due and payable from the persons by whom it was paid or his or her administrators or executors.

                  Sec. 66-153. - Purpose and policy. 
                  (a)  Generally. This article regulates the use of the county water and wastewater systems. 
                  (b)  Compliance with state and federal water pollution control laws. This article sets forth uniform requirements for persons who cause wastewater to be discharged into the wastewater collection and treatment system of the county and enables the county to comply with all applicable state and federal laws required by the Clean Water Act of 1977, as amended and the General Pretreatment Regulations (40 CFR 403), as amended. 
                  (c)  Objectives. The federally mandated objectives of this article are to: 
                  (1)  Prevent the introduction of pollutants into the county wastewater system which will interfere with the operation of the system or contaminate the resulting sludge; 
                  (2)  Prevent the introduction of pollutants into the county wastewater system which will pass through the system, inadequately treated, into receiving waters or the atmosphere, or otherwise be incompatible with the system; 
                  (3)  Improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewater and sludge from the system; and 
                  (4)  Provide for the equitable distribution of the cost of the county wastewater system. 
                  This article provides for the regulation of persons who cause wastewater to be discharged into the county wastewater system through the issuance of permits to certain nondomestic users and through enforcement activities, requires user reporting, assumes that existing customers' capacity will not be preempted and provides for the setting of fees for the equitable distribution of costs resulting from the operation and maintenance of the water and wastewater systems. 
                  (d)  Applicability. This article shall apply to the residents of the county and to all users of the county water and wastewater systems, including persons outside the county who are, by contract or agreement with the county, users of the county water or wastewater systems. Except as otherwise provided in this article, the county water system director or his agent shall administer, implement and enforce the provisions of the article.

                  (3)  Minor violations, defined. Minor violations shall be defined as any wastewater discharge violation which is not a major violation, as defined in subsection (b)(1) of this section. 
                  (4)  Minor violations, enforced. Minor violations shall be enforced by written warning only. The county shall provide written notice to the party in violation stating the nature of the violation and any other pertinent information regarding the violation or the need for corrective action. 
                  (Ord. of 2-4-2003, § 2-1) 
                  Sec. 66-172. - Notice of violation. 
                  (a)  When the department director finds that a user has violated any provision of this article, a wastewater permit or order issued pursuant to this article or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the department director may serve upon that user a written notice of violation. Within 15 days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific actions, shall be submitted by the user to the department director. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the department director to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation. The offender shall, within the period of time stated in such notice, permanently cease all violation. 
                  (b)  Written notice personally delivered or placed in the U.S. mail to the person's last known address shall be deemed sufficient notice under this section. However, with respect to violations regarding nonpayment of amounts due under this article, only notice mailed to the person's last known address of the amount owed and the date upon which payment is due shall be required. Additionally, there shall be no prior notice requirement for violations of water use restrictions duly published in accordance with section 66-191. 
                  (c)  Repeat violations within a 12-month period shall be enforced in any manner subsequently described in this division or by any combination thereof. 
                  (Ord. of 2-4-2003, § 2-2) 
                  Sec. 66-173. - Consent orders. 
                  The department director may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance or other documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include a specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a specific time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as administrative orders issued pursuant to section 66-175 and shall be judicially enforced. 
                  (Ord. of 2-4-2003, § 2-3) 
                  Sec. 66-174. - Show cause hearing. 
                  The department director may order any user who violates any provisions of this article or who causes or allows an unauthorized discharge to show cause before the department director as to why a particular proposed enforcement action should not be taken. A notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place of a hearing, to be held by the department director or his designee, regarding the violation, the reasons why the action is to be taken, the proposed enforcement actions and directing the user to show cause before the department director why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, not less than ten days before the hearing date. Service may be made on any agent, officer or person in responsible charge of a corporation. 
                  (Ord. of 2-4-2003, § 2-4) 
                  Sec. 66-175. - Administrative orders and penalty. 
                  (a)  Compliance or administrative orders. When it is found that an industrial user has violated or continues to violate this article, or a permit or an order issued thereunder, the water system may issue an order to the industrial user responsible for the discharge directing that, following a specific time period, sewer service shall be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances have been installed and are properly operated. Orders may also contain such other requirements as might be reasonably necessary and appropriate to address the noncompliance, including the installation of pretreatment technology, additional self-monitoring and management practices. 
                  (b)  Cease and desist orders. When it is found that an industrial user has violated or continues to violate this article or a permit or order issued thereunder, the department director may issue an order to cease and desist all such violations and direct those persons in noncompliance to: 
                  (1)  Comply forthwith; and 
                  (2)  Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and terminating the discharge. 
                  (c)  Penalty. Notwithstanding any other section of this article, any user who is found to have violated any provision of this article or permits and orders issued pursuant to this article shall be fined in an amount not to exceed $1,000.00 per violation. Each day on which noncompliance shall occur or continue shall be deemed a separate and distinct violation. Such assessments may be added to the user's next scheduled sewer charge and the water system shall have such other collection remedies as necessary to collect these and other service charges. Unpaid charges, fines and penalties shall constitute a lien against the individual's property. Industrial users desiring to dispute such fines must file a request for the director to reconsider the fine within ten days of being notified of the fine. Where the water system director believes a request has merit, he shall convene a hearing on the matter within 15 days of receiving the request from the industrial user.

                  Sec. 66-176. - Revocation of permit. 
                  (a)  County discharge permits issued in accordance with the provisions of this article may be suspended, revoked or denied for any of the violations set forth in section 66-314(h)(2). 
                  (b)  In addition to the provisions set forth in section 66-314(h)(2), conditions resulting in termination of service may include but not be limited to: 
                  (1)  Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions; 
                  (2)  Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge; 
                  (3)  Failure to report significant changes in operation or wastewater volume constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge; 
                  (4)  Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purposes of inspection, monitoring or sampling; or 
                  (5)  Violation of pretreatment standards in subdivision VI of this article. 
                  Where this action does not conflict with section 66-182, such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under section 66-174 why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the department director shall not be a bar to, or be a prerequisite for, taking other actions against the user.

                  Sec. 66-178. - Civil liabilities and penalties. 
                  (a)  Any person violating the provisions of this article, discharge permit, federal or state pretreatment requirements or any order of the county board of commissioners shall be liable to the county for a maximum civil penalty under O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20, of $1,000.00 per violation per day. In the case of monthly or other longterm average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation. 
                  (b)  The department director may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses and the cost of actual damages incurred by the county. 
                  (c)  In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take into account all relevant circumstances including, but not limited to, extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user and any other factor as justice requires. 
                  (d)  Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a perquisite for, taking any other action against a user.

                  Sec. 66-179. - Injunctive relief. 
                  When the department director finds that a user has violated or continues to violate any provisions of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or any order issued pursuant to this article or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the department director may petition the appropriate superior court of jurisdiction through the county attorney for issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order or other requirement imposed by this article on activities of the user. The water system director may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.

                  Nothing in this article shall restrain the department director from having the necessary authority and procedures, after informal notice to the discharger, to immediately effectively halt or prevent any discharge which reasonably appears to present imminent endangerment to the health or welfare of the public or wastewater treatment and collection personnel. 
                  (Ord. of 2-4-2003, § 2-13) 
                  Sec. 66-184. - Affirmative defenses to discharge violations. 
                  (a)  For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance or careless or improper operation. 
                  (b)  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection (c) of this section are met. 
                  (c)  A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate through properly signed contemporaneous operating logs or other relevant evidence that: 
                  (1)  An upset occurred and the user can identify the causes of the upset. 
                  (2)  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures. 
                  (3)  The user has submitted the following information to the director within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days): 
                  a.  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
                  b.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times, or if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
                  c.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
                  (4)  In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall bear the burden of proof. 
                  (5)  Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
                  (6)  Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, is lost or fails. 
                  (7)  A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in section 66-311(a) if it can prove that it did not know or have reason to know that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either: 
                  a.  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharge and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to and during the pass through or interference; or 
                  b.  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the county was regularly in compliance with NPDES permit and, in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.

                  Sec. 66-185. - Bypassing. 
                  (a)  Definitions. For the purposes of this section: 
                  Bypass means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a user's treatment facility. 
                  Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to treatment facilities which cause them to be inoperable, substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
                  (b)  Bypass that does not violate applicable pretreatment standards. An industrial user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it is also for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provisions of subsections (c) and (d) of this section. 
                  (c)  Notice. 
                  (1)  If the permittee knows in advance of the need for a bypass, he shall submit prior notice to the county, if possible, at least ten days before the date of the bypass. 
                  (2)  The permittee shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the county within 24 hours from the time that the permittee first becomes aware of the bypass.

                  (d)  Federal pretreatment standards. 
                  (1)  The federal government has adopted regulations governing wastewater discharges from industries into publicly owned wastewater treatment works (POTWs). These federal regulations are generally referred to as the federal pretreatment standards, or the Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards, as set forth in 40 CFR 405—471. Any portion of these federal standards which are more strict than the regulations in this article are incorporated by reference, and such regulations may be enforced by the county. 
                  (2)  It is the affirmative obligation of all industrial users regulated by the federal pretreatment standards, inclusive of the Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards, to comply with the federal standards whether or not the industry has received notification from the county or any other jurisdiction of the existence and nature of the federal standards. 
                  (3)  Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass limits or either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the department director may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6. 
                  (4)  When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the department director shall impose an alternative limit using the combined wastestream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e). 
                  (5)  A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard if the user can prove pursuant to the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13 that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when developing the categorical pretreatment standards. 
                  (6)  A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15. 
                  (e)  Modifications to federal standards. 
                  (1)  From time to time, the federal government may alter existing federal pretreatment standards or promulgate new standards. None of the provisions contained in this Code shall prevent the timely implementation of new or altered federal standards by the industries to whom the new or altered standards apply. Where new or altered federal standards are more strict than the standards presently being imposed by the county, the county may, without prejudice, immediately revise any industrial wastewater discharge permits to reflect the new or altered standards. If the industrial user is unable to immediately conform to the new or altered standards, a reasonable schedule for compliance shall be provided by the department director. 
                  (2)  Where the county's wastewater treatment system achieves consistent removal of pollutants limited by federal pretreatment standards, the county may apply to the approval authority for modification of specific limits in the federal pretreatment standards. The term "consistent removal" shall mean reduction in the amount of a pollutant or alteration of the nature of the pollutant by the wastewater treatment system to a less toxic or harmless state in the effluent which is achieved by the system in 95 percent of the samples taken when measured according to the procedures set forth in section 403.7(c)(2) of title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, part 403, "General Pretreatment Regulations for Existing and New Sources of Pollution," promulgated pursuant to the Clean Water Act, as amended. The county may then modify pollutant discharge limits in the federal pretreatment standards if the requirements contained in 40 CFR part 403, section 403.7, are fulfilled and prior approval from the state environmental protection division is obtained. 
                  (f)  County's right of revision. The county reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or in wastewater discharge permits, more stringent standards or requirements on discharges to the POTW. 
                  (g)  Dilution. No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The water system director or his agent may impose mass limitations on users who are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.

In order to provide for accurate sampling and measurement of industrial wastes, each significant contributing industry shall provide and maintain, on each of its industrial waste outlet sewers, a large manhole or sampling chamber to be located outside the plant. If inside the plant fence, there shall be a gate near the sampling manhole with a key furnished to the county. There shall be ample room provided in each sampling manhole to enable convenient inspection and sampling by the county, or its agent. In certain sampling manholes where noxious fumes may accumulate, the county may require a fume exhaust system to protect the life and health of the county employees who are required to enter the sampling manhole. The fume exhaust system should extract the fumes from the bottom of the manhole and provide not less than one air change per minute. The manhole shall include a waterproof 120V, single phase electrical outlet at or near the installation. 
                  (c)  Provision for flow monitoring. Each sampling manhole shall contain a properly installed flow monitoring device such as a Parshall flume, Palmer-Bowlus flume or other similar device approved by the county. Plans of the proposed sampling manhole and monitoring device shall be prepared by a registered engineer and submitted to the county for review and approval. The CCWS director may require the industrial user to install additional equipment necessary to measure, record, and total flow. This equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition. Devices used to measure wastewater flow shall be calibrated periodically, but not less frequently than annually, to ensure their accuracy. Records of this calibration must be kept for a period of three years and submitted to the CCWS upon request.

                  (2)  Biological or chemical treatment agents. The use of biological or chemical treatment agents may be allowed in addition to, but not in lieu of, required grease removal systems, provided the user supplies verification that discharge requirements are being met. To verify compliance, beginning 90 days from the last trap cleaning, the discharge must be sampled four times within 24 hours during the hours of operation and analyzed for oil and grease concentrations. In addition, the depth of bottom and top solids must be measured. This testing must be performed monthly and the results submitted to CCWS within the same testing monthly. When the oil and grease concentrations exceed the county's daily maximum discharge limits and/or the combined depth of bottom and top solids exceeds 50 percent of the total depth of the trap, the trap must be cleaned and the process started again. 
                  (f)  User responsibility. 
                  (1)  User responsibility and acknowledgement. 
                  a.  Users that are required to install a grease, fats and oils recovery system shall be responsible for the cleaning and maintenance of the grease, fats and oils recovery systems located on the property. The user shall be responsible for maintaining any grease recovery system pursuant to subsection (f)(1)b. of this section and in such a manner that the grease discharge shall not exceed the county's daily maximum discharge limits as developed and approved by the county board of commissioners. The currently adopted limits shall be on file at the office of the county clerk and at the office of the director of the county water system. 
                  b.  The user shall maintain accurate records (manifests and logs) of the dates of cleaning and the means of disposal of grease, fats and oils. These records are subject to inspection and review by CCWS pursuant to and in accordance with subsection (c)(3) of this section. 
                  c.  Any removal and hauling of grease, fats and oils shall be performed by a licensed waste disposal or rendering firm. If the grease recovery system fails to prevent discharge over the daily maximum, CCWS will require the user to repair, replace or upgrade their grease removal system, which may include one or more of the user's devices, at the user's expense. 
                  d.  All costs related to the building's sewer installation, grease recovery system or connection and registration shall be borne by the user. 
                  e.  The user shall be required to sign an Acknowledgment Form furnished by CCWS attesting to the user's understanding of the aforementioned responsibility. 
                  (2)  Grease trap maintenance. 
                  a.  All grease traps shall be maintained by the user at the user's expense. Maintenance shall include the complete recovery of all contents, including floating materials, wastewater and bottom sludges and solids. All grease recovery systems, including passive interior devices, passive exterior devices, and any grease recovery devices, shall be properly and adequately maintained by the user so as to achieve the intended purpose of the device. 
                  b.  In the maintaining of these grease recovery systems, the user shall be responsible for proper recovery, removal and disposal by appropriate, approved means of the captured material by a licensed waste disposal or rendering firm. 
                  c.  All PEDs shall be completely pumped out at a minimum of once every three months, or more frequently as required by CCWS to comply with this section or the manufacturer's recommendation. The frequency of removal shall be such as to ensure that no overflows of oils or grease into the wastewater collection system ever results. Decanting or discharging of removed waste back into the trap from which the waste was removed or to any other grease trap or sanitary sewer connection for the purpose of reducing the volume to be hauled is prohibited. 
                  (g)  Enforcement. 
                  (1)  Monitoring. The user shall install a manhole on the discharge sewer to allow observation, sampling and measurement of grease recovery system discharges. This manhole shall be installed so as to be safe and accessible at all times. 
                  (2)  Inspection and entry. Any authorized representative of CCWS bearing proper credentials and identification shall be permitted to enter and inspect all properties without prior notification. This right of inspection shall include the right to measure, observe, monitor, sample, test, record, review and make copies of all pertinent documents in accordance with this section. 
                  (h)  Violations and penalties. 
                  (1)  Violations. It shall be unlawful for any user to discharge water to CCWS in a manner in violation of this section, or of any conditions set forth in this article. Any person who violates any provision of this section shall, in addition to the penalties specified herein, be subject to the provisions contained in sections 66-171 through 66-185, to the extent such violations, notice and penalties are not addressed in this section. 
                  (2)  Notice of noncompliance. If through inspection, it is determined that the user has failed to comply with the provisions of this section, a written warning of the violation shall be given to the user, the contractor named in the permit, or the user's authorized agent. The notice shall set forth the violation and the measure needed to achieve compliance. The user shall have seven days from receipt of this notice to comply. Where an emergency exists, a written warning shall be given to the user, and the user will have 24 hours to comply. 
                  (3)  Failure to comply. CCWS shall have the power and authority to enter upon the property of any user who, after having received a written warning, has failed to comply with the provisions of this article, to terminate the user's water and/or wastewater service in any manner deemed necessary and appropriate by CCWS. Additionally, CCWS may request that the county board of commissioners suspend or revoke the user's business license after a show cause hearing, pursuant to section 66-174. 
                  (4)  Overflow penalty. Any sewer or manhole overflow traced to an inadequately operating grease recovery system or lack of a grease recovery system will result in a service charge to the user. The service charge shall include the cost of cleaning up the overflow and for cleaning grease out of the immediately adjacent contaminated CCWS wastewater collection system. This penalty will be doubled with each successive overflow. This penalty shall not impede other enforcement actions as delineated in sections 66-171 through 66-174. Additionally, the user shall be responsible for payment of any fine levied by the state environmental protection division against the county as a result of overflows in the county wastewater collection system caused by grease traced to any inadequate or absent grease recovery system. 
                  (Ord. of 2-4-2003, § 2-148.1) 
                  Sec. 66-320. - High strength wastewater surcharge. 
                  (a)  Establishment. 
                  (1)  All users discharging high strength wastewater into the county wastewater system shall be assessed a monetary surcharge, in addition to the normally required sewer use charges, in an amount to be calculated as shown below. The term "high strength wastewater" is defined as wastewater which contains the parameters and is in excess of concentrations as normally discharged by the average residence. These concentrations shall be determined by the water system and approved by the county board of commissioners. 
                  (2)  The parameters shall be determined by the utilization of the sampling and testing procedures as provided in section 66-315. Concentrations in excess of those set by the water system will be assessed a surcharge. The amount of the surcharge, which is hereby charged and assessed against all users discharging high strength wastewater into the county wastewater system, shall reflect the cost incurred by the county in handling the excess BOD, TSS, ammonia and total phosphorus. This surcharge shall include a proportionate share of charges for maintenance and operation of the wastewater treatment facilities, including depreciation and other incidental expenses. 
                  (3)  The current domestic limits and rates shall be on file and available at the office of the county clerk and at the office of the manager of the county water system. 
                  (b)  Formula. When the concentrations of the surcharged parameters shown in this section exceed the values of the constituents as set forth in subsection (a) of this section, the excess concentrations shall be subject to a surcharge in the amount derived in accordance with the following formula: 
                  P X (G-R) X 8.34 X C = $/month 
                  Where: 
                  "P" is equal to the concentration in mg/l of the parameter being evaluated (BOD, TSS, ammonia, total inorganic phosphates or floatable oil and grease), which is in excess of the amounts shown in subsection (a) of this section. 
                  "G" is equal to the user's monthly water consumption in millions of gallons as determined from the user's monthly water meter or sewage flow meter readings. 
                  "R" is equal to the quantity of water in millions of gallons per month which is retained by the user, or that portion of water consumption which goes into the manufactured product or its production byproducts, or is otherwise disposed of by means other than into the county wastewater system. 
                  "8.34" is a conversion factor. 
                  "C" is equal to the unit cost in dollars per pound ($/lb.) for the treatment of the surcharged parameters. This value shall be established by the department director based on actual wastewater treatment costs which shall be revised from time to time as necessary. 
                  (c)  Quantitative measurement of surchargable parameters. The measurement of the surcharge parameters (BOD, TSS, ammonia, total phosphorus) shall be conducted as follows: 
                  (1)  The county shall sample and test the user as provided in section 66-315 once per year, except that the duration of the sampling to determine surcharge shall be for a period of not less than five calendar days. 
                  (2)  The county need not provide any prior notice to the industry with regard to the sampling period. 
                  (3)  The county may sample the user as often as desired at the county's expense if, in the opinion of the county, representative samples have not been previously obtained. 
                  (4)  If, in the opinion of the user, the samples taken by the county are not representative of the user's typical wastewater, then the user may request up to two additional re-samplings. The user will be assessed a fee by the county which will be based on the actual costs to the county associated with re-sampling. The county may, but is not required to, provide the user with prior notice of the entry. 
                  (d)  Measurement of flow used in computing wastewater service charges and surcharges. The volumes of flow used in computing wastewater surcharges shall be based upon metered, estimated or prorated water consumption as shown in the records of meter reading maintained by the county water department. If a significant contributing industry discharging wastewater into the county wastewater system provides evidence to the county that a significant portion of the total annual volume of water used for all purposes does not reach the county wastewater system, an estimated percentage of total water consumption to be used in computing charges may be approved by the county. The estimated water usage which is retained by the significant contributing industry (not discharged to the wastewater system) shall be determined by an independent engineer acceptable to the county, who shall provide such analysis based on all available information. This retainage analysis shall then be submitted to the county by the significant industrial user to obtain proper credit for retainage to be credited against its surcharge and normal wastewater service charges. 
                  (e)  Perceived harm. Where a discharge causes harm or is perceived to cause harm to the POTW in violation of section 66-171, the director of the water system may void any rights to surcharge for high strength wastes and proceed with any enforcement.

                  Sec. 66-321. - Procedure for uses to establish retainage for credit against wastewater service charges. 
                  Any industrial, commercial or institutional user of the county wastewater system will not be required to pay wastewater service charges for metered water which the customer does not return to the sewer, provided the following conditions are met: 
                  (1)  The user must have a retainage analysis conducted twice per year by an independent county engineering firm, which shall be selected by the county water system. The retainage analysis shall provide a value of retainage which will be a longterm average of the percentage of water used which is not returned to the sewer. 
                  (2)  The user shall pay the engineer's fees for the retainage analysis. 
                  (3)  The retainage analysis must bear the seal of the engineer who performed the analysis. 
                  (4)  The county water system may elect, at its sole discretion, to waive one of the two annual retainage analyses. 
                  (5)  The county reserves the right to dictate which months of the year the retainage analyses will be performed.

                  (b)  Equipment requirements. (LUST) remediation projects shall contain the following treatment equipment, including: 
                  (1)  Pump. Contaminated groundwater is removed from the recovery wells. 
                  (2)  Gravity separation. The groundwater must pass then through an API type oil/water separator with a minimum design API retention time of 30 minutes. 
                  (3)  Volatile removal. The groundwater must then pass through one of the following devices to remove volatile organic compounds: 
                  a.  A carbon adsorption unit. 
                  b.  An air stripping device. 
                  c.  A bio-reactor. 
                  d.  An ultraviolet/peroxide oxidation device. 
                  (4)  Metering. The water must then pass through a flow meter and an effluent sampling device (tap) before discharge to the sanitary sewer. Records of daily flow must be maintained and submitted on a monthly report. 
                  (c)  Permit conditions. The permitting process shall require that the following discharge criteria and permit conditions must be met for continued use of the sewer system:

                  (4)  To provide for equitable distribution of the cost of the county wastewater system. 
                  This article provides for the regulation of persons who cause wastewater to be discharged into the county wastewater system through the issuance of permits to certain nondomestic users and through enforcement activities, requires user reporting, assumes that existing customers' capacity will not be preempted, and provides for the setting of fees for the equitable distribution of costs resulting from the operation and maintenance of the water and wastewater systems. 
                  (b)  Applicability. This article shall apply to the residents of the county and to all users of the county water and wastewater systems including persons outside the county who are, by contract or agreement with the county, users of the county water and wastewater systems. Except as otherwise provided herein, the director of water and wastewater, also known as the utility director, and hereafter referred to as the director, or his designee shall administer, implement and enforce the provisions of the ordinance. 
                  (c)  Allocation. No allocation of sewer capacity shall be made that results in more than 50 percent of the capacity at all sewer treatment facilities being allocated to residential use.

                  (3)  The user shall submit a progress report to the director no later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final date of compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate, the steps being taken by the user to return to the established schedule; and 
                  (4)  In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress reports to the director. 
                  (c)  Periodic compliance reports: 
                  (1)  All significant industrial users shall, at a frequency determined by the director but in no case less than twice per year (in June and December), submit a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with section 66-423. 
                  (2)  All other users who have been issued discharge permits are required to submit compliance reports at the intervals set forth in each user's individual permit. The compliance reports shall address the discharge parameters and all other information indicated as being necessary to report as shown in the user's permit. 
                  (3)  All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
                  (4)  If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the director, using the procedures prescribed in section 66-424, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report. 
                  (d)  Reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadline. Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any user subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the director a report containing the information described in subsection (a)(2)d—f of this section. For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR 403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's longterm production rate. For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with section 66-423. 
                  (e)  Reports of changed conditions. Each user must notify the director of any planned significant changes to the user's operations or system which might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater at least 60 days before the change. 
                  (1)  The director may require the user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under section 66-426. 
                  (2)  The director may issue a wastewater discharge permit under section 66-426 or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under section 66-426 in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions. 
                  (3)  For purposes of this requirement, significant changes include, but are not limited to, flow increases of 20 percent or greater, and the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants. 
                  (f)  Reports of potential problem, including slug loading. 
                  (1)  In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch discharge, or a slug load, that may cause potential problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the industrial pretreatment coordinator of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user. 
                  (2)  Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless waived by the director, submit a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this article. 
                  (3)  A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a discharge described in subsection (f)(1) of this section. Employers shall ensure that all employees, who may cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the emergency notification procedure.

                  (h)  Notice of violation/repeat sampling and reporting. If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the director within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the director within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. The user is not required to resample if the county monitors at the user's facility at least once a month, or if the county samples between the user's initial sampling and when the user receives the results of this sampling. 
                  (i)  Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste. 
                  (1)  Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this subsection need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under subsection (e) of this section. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of subsections (a), (c) and (d) of this section. 
                  (2)  Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of subsection (f)(1) of this section, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
                  (3)  In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the director, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and state-hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations. 
                  (4)  In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
                  (5)  This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this article, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law. 
                  (j)  Sampling and testing. All sampling and testing performed under this subsection for reporting requirements shall be conducted in accordance with section 66-424. 
                  (k)  Written reports. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern.

All users shall provide necessary wastewater pretreatment as required to comply with the limitations and provisions contained in this article and to achieve compliance with all federal categorical pretreatment standards within the time limitations as specified by the federal pretreatment regulations. Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the county shall be provided, operated and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans prepared by a registered professional engineer showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the county for review and shall be acceptable to the county prior to commencement of construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user of the responsibility for modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the county under the provisions of this chapter. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported to and be acceptable to the county prior to the user's initiation of the changes. 
                  (b)  Compliance schedules. The timing of construction and operation of pretreatment facilities as required hereby shall be in accordance with the compliance schedules provided by the county as described in section 66-427(b); however, the county shall also have the authority to issue compliance schedules independent of the permitting process and such compliance schedules may be enforced by the county as provided in the enforcement and penalties section of this chapter. 
                  (c)  Maintenance of pretreatment facilities. All wastewater pretreatment facilities shall be properly and adequately maintained by the user so as to achieve the intended purpose of the facilities. 
                  (d)  Peak flow periods. Whenever deemed necessary, the director may require users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage waste streams from industrial waste streams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine the user's compliance with the requirements of this article. 
                  (e)  Suitable storage and flow-control facility. The director may require any person discharging into the POTW to install and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a suitable storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow. A wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization. 
                  (f)  Approved combustible gas detection meter. Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter.

                  Sec. 66-432. - Accidental discharges. 
                  (a)  Protection against. Each significant industrial user shall provide protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this article. Additionally, any person or industry which handles hazardous wastes, any priority pollutant as shown on the EPA list, or any prohibited materials shall, upon the request of the county, provide proof of protection from accidental discharge of hazardous wastes, priority pollutants, or prohibited materials. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the owner's or user's own cost and expense. Detailed plans prepared by a registered professional engineer showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the county for review, and shall be approved by the county before construction of the facilities. All existing users shall complete such a plan within 90 days after the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived. Construction shall be completed within 180 days of approval of plans by the county. No significant industrial user who commences contribution to the county wastewater system after the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until accidental discharge procedures and facilities (if required) have been approved by the county. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the user from the responsibility to modify the user's facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this article. 
                  (b)  Notification required. Notification of accidental discharge shall be in accordance with section 66-427(f). 
                  (c)  Accidental discharge/slug control plans. At least once every two years, the director shall evaluate whether each significant industrial user needs an accidental discharge/slug control plan. The director may require any user to develop, submit for approval, and implement such a plan. Alternatively, the director may develop such a plan for any user. An accidental discharge/slug control plan shall address, at a minimum, the following: 
                  (1)  Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch discharges; 
                  (2)  Description of stored chemicals;

                  (a)  Septic tank waste may be introduced into the POTW only at locations designated by the director, and at such times as are established by the director. Such waste shall not violate any section of this article or any other requirements established by the county. The director may require septic tank waste haulers to obtain wastewater discharge permits. 
                  (b)  The director shall require haulers of industrial waste to obtain wastewater discharge permits. The director may require generators of hauled industrial waste to obtain wastewater discharge permits. The director also may prohibit the disposal of hauled industrial waste. The discharge of hauled industrial waste is subject to all other requirements of this article. 
                  (c)  Industrial waste haulers may discharge loads only at locations designated by the director. No load may be discharged without prior consent of the director, the director may collect samples of each hauled load to ensure compliance with applicable standards. The director may require the industrial waste hauler to provide a waste analysis of any load prior to discharge. 
                  (d)  Industrial waste haulers must provide a waste-tracking form for every load. This form shall include, at a minimum, the name and address of the industrial waste hauler, permit number, truck identification, names and addresses of sources of waste, and volume and characteristics of waste.

                  Sec. 66-434. - Affirmative defenses to discharge violations. 
                  (a)  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Bypass means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a user's treatment facility. 
                  Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
                  (b)  A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsections (c) and (d) of this section. 
                  (c)  (1)  If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the director, at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
                  (2)  A user shall submit oral notice to the pretreatment coordinator of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The director may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours. 
                  (d)  A bypass is prohibited, and the director may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless: 
                  (1)  The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe, property damage; 
                  (2)  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
                  (3)  The user submitted notices as required under subsection (c) of this section. 
                  (e)  The director may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the director determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (d) of this section.

                  Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits, and monitoring programs, and from the county's inspection and sampling activities, shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the director, that the release of such information would divulge information, processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as "trade secrets" under applicable state law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information or data. To the extent allowed by law, when requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other effluent data as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the public without restriction.

                  Sec. 66-439. - High strength wastewater surcharge. 
                  (a)  Establishment of. Users discharging "high strength" wastewater into the county wastewater system may be assessed a monetary surcharge, in addition to the normally required sewer use charges, in an amount to be calculated as shown below. A "high strength" wastewater is defined as wastewater which contains the below shown parameters in excess of the below shown monthly average concentrations: 
                  (1)  Five day, 20° C biochemical oxygen demand (BOD 5 ) of 300 milligrams per liter (mg/l), not to exceed a maximum of 500 mg/l. 
                  (2)  Chemical oxygen demand (COD) of 500 milligrams per liter (mg/l), not to exceed a maximum of 1,000 mg/l 
                  (3)  Total ammonia nitrogen (NH 3 +NH 4 ) of 30 mg/l, not to exceed a maximum of 45 mg/l. 
                  (4)  Total inorganic phosphates of 12 mg/l, not to exceed a maximum 16 mg/l. 
                  (5)  Floatable oil and grease of 100 mg/l, not to exceed a maximum of 150 mg/l. 
                  The above parameters shall be determined by the utilization of the sampling and testing procedures as provided in section 66-424. The amount of the surcharge, which may be charged and assessed against all users discharging high strength wastewater into the county wastewater system, shall reflect the cost incurred by the county in handling the excess oxygen demand, ammonia, total inorganic phosphates, and floatable oil and grease. This surcharge shall include a proportionate share of charges for maintenance and operation of the wastewater treatment facilities including depreciation and other incidental expenses. 
                  (b)  Formula. When the concentrations of the surcharged parameters shown above exceed the values of the constituents as set forth in subsection (a) of this section, the excess concentrations may be subject to a surcharge in the amount derived in accordance with the following formula: 
                  Surcharge $/month P × G × 8.34 × C 
                  Where: 
                  "P" is the excess monthly average concentration in mg/l of the parameter (BOD 5 , etc.) being evaluated; i.e., the actual concentration less the allowable concentration listed in subsection (a) of this section would be the excess. The maximum concentration shown in subsection (a) of this section shall not be exceeded. 
                  "G" is equal to the user's total monthly wastewater flow in millions of gallons. 
                  "8.34" pounds per gallon conversion factor. 
                  "C" is equal to the unit cost in dollars per pound ($/lb) for the treatment of the surcharged parameters. This value shall be established by the director based on actual wastewater treatment costs which shall be revised from time to time as necessary. 
                  (c)  Quantitative measurement of surchargeable parameters. The measurement of the surcharge parameters (BOD 5 , COD, ammonia, total inorganic phosphates, or floatable oil and grease) shall be conducted as follows: 
                  (1)  Monitoring to determine surcharge shall be conducted by the industrial user as specified in the user's permit except that frequency of testing for surchargeable parameters shall be a minimum of two tests per month. If the permit requires more frequent testing, then the average of all test results will be used to calculate the surcharge. If the permit requires less frequent testing for compliance purposes, then testing frequency will be increased to twice per month. 
                  (2)  The county may sample the user as often as desired at the county's expense. The county will split the sample with the industrial user at the user's request. 
                  (d)  Billing procedure. Wastewater surcharges as provided for in this section will be included on the user's regular water and sewer bill or on a separate wastewater surcharge bill.

                  (3)  Any other discharge violation that the director believes has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through, including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public; 
                  (4)  Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment to the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the director's exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge; 
                  (5)  Failure to meet, within 90 days of the scheduled date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance; 
                  (6)  Failure to provide within 30 days after the due date, any required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules; 
                  (7)  Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or 
                  (8)  Any other violations which the director determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the county's pretreatment program.

In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the director may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The director may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the director that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in section 66-465 are initiated against the user. 
                  (2)  A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the director prior to the date of a termination hearing under section 66-465.

In the case of a monthly or other long term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation, but shall not exceed $25,000.00 cumulatively.

                  (b)  In addition to any monetary fine imposed, the director may seek restitution of reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the county. 
                  (c)  In determining the amount of penalty to be imposed, the court shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions voluntarily undertaken by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice requires. 
                  (d)  In lieu of the provisions of subsections (a) through (c) of this section, the director may, in his sole discretion, elect to file a complaint for civil liability in the state court, in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 12-5-51.

                  (e)  Conviction in the municipal court under this section shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.

The director shall apply for a state warrant for violation of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-53(a), returnable to the state court. 
                  (b)  The director shall seek the issuance of state warrants for any person violating any of the provisions set forth in O.C.G.A. § 12-5-53(b) through (d), returnable to the appropriate state courts of criminal jurisdiction.

However, the director may take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the director is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user. 
                  (Ord. of 2-4-2003, § 49)

                  Written notice personally delivered or placed in the U.S. Mail by certified mail to the person's last known address, as shown in county utility billing records, shall be deemed sufficient notice for all enforcement actions in this article.

Standing seam metal roofing material of copper or with baked on color may be used in limited applications for accent but may not be used as the primary roofing material on a building. Chimneys and cupolas are permitted where approved in the rezone concept plans and architectural drawings submitted with the rezone application. Other roof mounted structures such as solar collectors, and HVAC equipment are prohibited.

The gate posts for the front gates to dumpster enclosures shall be located approximately three feet from the front of the enclosure wall to allow pedestrian access to the dumpster without opening and closing the gate. The gates shall remain closed at all times except during truck delivery or pick up or emptying of the dumpster container. 
                  (d)  Service areas, delivery areas and dumpster areas shall be directed and located away from any residential side of the development and in no case shall they be located directly between the building and any residential lot. 
                  (e)  No part of a dumpster or materials stored within the service area shall extend above the required masonry wall or fence.

Said buffers shall not be used for the purpose of parking, loading, servicing or storage activity. Said requirement is in lieu of requirements in the landscaping and buffers article of this Development Code for a landscape buffer between commercial uses and adjacent one- or two-family residential lots. 

                  (b)  At least 30 percent of the lot must be vegetated open space that will allow the percolation of rainwater into the soil. Required buffer area may be used in determining this percentage.

                  (1)  The 78/316 special district overlay boundaries shall be as designated on the Official Zoning Map of Oconee County, Georgia, as shown on Appendix C hereto. The Official Zoning Map of Oconee County, Georgia is hereby amended by adding the 78/316 special district overlay as a zoning district to the legend to said map, as shown on Appendix C hereto. 
                  (2)  In any case where the provisions of the 78/316 special district overlay conflict with those of the underlying zoning district or with other provisions of the unified development code, the standards and requirements of the 78/316 overlay district shall govern. 
                  (3)  The conditions for approval of any rezoning, variance, or conditional use approved by the governing jurisdiction under any prior ordinance shall remain in full force and effect and enforceable under the procedures of this special district overlay. 
                  (4)  If aspects of a development are not expressly regulated by the standards associated with the 78/316 special district overlay, the development standards associated with the underlying zoning designation and all other applicable development regulations administered by the jurisdiction in which the development is located shall apply. 
                  c.  Special district overlay amendment and boundary alteration procedure—General provisions. 
                  (1)  Changing needs and a dynamic economy of a growing community may from time to time require periodic updates of this special district overlay ordinance to maintain consistency between the provisions of the article and various community plans. In order to fulfill the above-stated purposes , the governing authorities of Athens-Clarke County, Oconee County, and the City of Bogart commit not only to the enforcement of this zoning ordinance but to its ongoing maintenance and updating as typical planning and review processes may dictate.

                  iii.  The intent of this section is to encourage use of brick or stone veneer as the predominant exterior material. Where other materials are used as the dominant exterior finish, (i.e. wood or cement board siding) use of brick and/or stone foundation walls, columns, accents and detailing shall be required with a minimum of 20 percent of each exterior wall comprised of said brick or stone materials. Changes to surface materials should be made at inside corners rather than outside corners. 
                  iv.  The use of visible concrete block, painted block, split face block, poured concrete, metal, or prefabricated wall panels is specifically prohibited on all exterior wall faces. Where walls are structurally formed of such prohibited finish materials they must be completely finished per the guidelines for brick, stone, siding, stucco or glass as provided above. 
                  v.  No flat or blank wall exceeding 25 feet in length shall be permitted for any structure; wall offsets, architectural details, doorways, windows and contrasting construction materials shall be used to meet this requirement.

                  ( Res. of 4-5-2016 , Exh. A) 
                  Appendix C: 78/316 Special District Overlay Location Map 

                  (Res. of 9-4-2012, Exh. A) 
                  Sec. 207. - Uses allowed in each zoning district. 
                  This section identifies the uses that are allowed by right or by special use approval in each of the zoning districts (section 205), and uses to which certain restrictions apply. 
                  a.  In specific areas covered by an overlay district, the overlay district imposes restrictions on uses not noted on the following use tables. The specifics of each overlay district under section 206 must be consulted as applicable to a particular property or area. 
                  b.  In master planned developments (MPDs) and planned unit developments (PUDs), uses that are allowed are established through approval of the planned development. See the subdivisions and planned developments article of this Development Code for details. 
                  Sec. 207.02. - Chart of uses. 
                  This section lists by the following matrix chart the uses allowed by right and by special use approval in each zoning district. A listed allowed use is one which is allowed in the zone without any qualifications, except wherever such qualifications may be indicated in this Development Code. A listed special use is one which may be granted only when certain conditions are met. In the following chart, an "A" means that the use is automatically allowed in the zoning district listed by the abbreviation at the top of the column. An "S" means that the use is allowed only by special use approval. A blank space indicates that the use is not allowed under any circumstances. 
                  Sec. 207.03. - Allowed principal and accessory uses. 
                  a.  A principal use is the specific, primary purpose for which land or a building is used. 
                  b.  An accessory use is a use that is permitted on a property in conjunction with a principal use. An accessory use is incidental to the principal use and would not exist independent of the principal use. 
                  c.  Principal uses that are allowed by right or allowed only by special use approval in each zoning district are shown on the following table 2.1. Accessory uses that are allowed in conjunction with a principal use are shown on table 2.2. 
                  Sec. 207.04. - Special uses. 
                  Principal and accessory uses that are special uses may be granted subject to special use approval procedures as set forth in the procedures and permits article of this Code. 
                  Sec. 207.05. - Restrictions on particular uses. 
                  Restrictions that apply to certain principal uses and to certain zoning districts are listed in the restrictions on particular uses article of this Code (article 3). The restrictions also apply to special uses unless specifically waived or modified as a stipulation of special use approval. For those uses that have specific restrictions associated with them, a reference is given on the two tables to the pertinent section in article 3. The provisions of division 1 of article 3 that apply to development in general, and division IV, prohibited uses, however, are not indicated in either of the two tables. 1 [] 
                  Footnotes: 
                  --- () --- 
                  The following sections of article 3 apply generally and may not be otherwise noted on table 2.1 or table 2.2 in all cases: 
                  § 302, Separation distances between certain use; 
                  § 303, Environmentally hazardous uses; 
                  § 304, Standards for single-family and two-family dwellings; 
                  § 305, Standards for multi-family dwellings (including townhouses); 
                  § 306, Standards for nonresidential uses; 
                  § 307, Sexually oriented adult uses; 
                  Division IV, Prohibited uses. 

                  Sec. 207.06. - Prohibited uses. 
                  a.  Any principal use not shown on the following table 2.1 as allowed in a zoning district, whether by right or with approval as a special use, is specifically prohibited. 
                  b.  Any accessory use not shown on the following table 2.2 as allowed in a zoning district, whether by right or with approval as a special use, is specifically prohibited. 
                  c.  In addition, uses, products and manufacturing processes that are specifically prohibited in all zoning districts are listed in division IV of article 3. 
                  Sec. 207.07. - Interpretation of uses. 
                  Some degree of interpretation will occasionally be required. It is not possible to list each and every variation or name of a given use. 
                  a.  In addition to other generally accepted references and resources, the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS), published by the U.S. Department of Commerce (current available edition), may be referred to in order to interpret the definition of uses listed on table 2.3 and table 2.4 and to identify similar uses that may be allowed along with each listed use. The NAICS classification number is shown on the tables for each applicable use for reference and interpretation only; the NAICS is not adopted as part of this Code. 
                  b.  The NAICS assigns classification numbers to businesses and industries based on the primary business activity in which the company is engaged. While business activity usually corresponds to land use type, and therefore can be easily assigned to appropriate zoning districts, there are exceptions. Some businesses may be primarily engaged in a certain industry—such as telecommunications, for instance, like BellSouth—but individual locations host notably different activities. For a company like BellSouth, for instance, different facilities may include retail stores for telephones, offices for administrative functions, satellite and exchange switching stations, and repair and installation staging lots where heavy equipment vehicles, telephone poles, wire spools and materials are stored. As a result, interpretation is occasionally needed for an individual use, regardless of the business activity in which the parent company is engaged. 
                  (1)  If no NAICS classification number is shown on the table, there is no corresponding category to the land use listed. The use may be residential in nature (there are no NAICS categories for residences) or may be a land use activity not generally recognized as a business activity or industry type. 
                  (2)  In all cases of uncertainty, the determination of whether or not a particular use is allowed in a particular zoning district shall reflect the purpose of the zoning district as stated in this article, both the common and dictionary definitions of the use, and the array of listed uses that are allowed in the district as to their character and intensity. 
                  The following tables of allowed uses are organized under the following land use categories: 
                  Table 2.1 organizes the various principal uses under the following headings: 
                  •  Agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting 
                  •  Residential uses 
                  •  Administrative and professional offices 
                  •  Commercial services 
                  •  Arts, entertainment and recreation 
                  •  Retail Trade 
                  •  Manufacturing, wholesaling and warehousing 
                  •  Transportation, communications and utilities 
                  •  Public and institutional uses 
                  Table 2.2 presents the various accessory uses allowed in each zoning district.

                  Sec. 307. - Sexually oriented adult uses. 
                  Sec. 307.01. - Purpose. 
                  a.  Based on the experiences of other counties and municipalities, including, but not limited to, Austin, Texas and Garden Grove, California, which experiences are found to be relevant to the problems faced by Oconee County, Georgia; and based on the documentary evidence and oral testimony presented by a law enforcement professional and an expert in economic development, both of whom are familiar with conditions resulting in other localities, at the board of commissioners' hearing on January 28, 2003, and based on the evidence and testimony of persons who have appeared before members of the Oconee County Board of Commissioners on other occasions and on documentary evidence submitted to the board of commissioners, the Oconee County Board of Commissioners takes note of the well-known and self-evident conditions and secondary effects attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among the various communities within our country. 
                  b.  It is the finding of the Board of Commissioners of Oconee County that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in establishments offering live nude entertainment or "adult entertainment," (whether such alcoholic beverages are sold on the premises or not) begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. In the same manner, establishments offering cinematographic or videographic adult entertainment have the same deleterious effects on the community. 
                  c.  Among the acts of criminal behavior found to be associated with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, live commercial nudity in general, and cinematographic or videographic adult entertainment are disorderly conduct, prostitution, public solicitation, public indecency, drug use and drug trafficking. Among the undesirable community conditions identified in other communities with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, commercial nudity in general, and cinematographic or videographic adult entertainment are depression of property values and acceleration of community blight in the surrounding neighborhood, increased allocation of and expenditure for law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, and increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior herein above described. The board of commissioners finds it is reasonable to believe that some or all of these undesirable community conditions will result in Oconee County, as well. 
                  d.  Furthermore, it is the finding of the Oconee County Board of Commissioners that other forms of adult entertainment including, but not limited to, adult book stores, adult novelty shops, adult video stores, peep shows, adult theaters, and massage parlors have an adverse effect upon the quality of life in surrounding communities. 
                  e.  The board of commissioners finds that the negative secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments upon Oconee County are similar whether the adult entertainment establishment features live nude dancing or sells video tapes depicting sexual activities. In addition, the board of commissioners has been made aware of Gwinnett County's experience with the adult bookstore located within the county on Jimmy Carter Boulevard which has shown that a substantial amount of activity at that bookstore involves booths which an individual may enter, view videos depicting sexual activity, and sexually interact with a bookstore patron in an adjoining booth through a hole strategically placed in the wall of adjoining booths. 
                  f.  The Board of Commissioners of Oconee County, Georgia, therefore finds that it is in the best interests of the health, welfare, safety and morals of the community and the preservation of its businesses, neighborhoods, and of churches, schools, residential areas, public parks and children's daycare facilities to prevent or reduce the adverse impacts of adult entertainment establishments. Therefore, the Board of Commissioners of Oconee County finds that licensing and regulations are necessary for any adult entertainment establishment. The board finds that these regulations promote the public welfare by furthering legitimate public and governmental interests, including but not limited to, reducing criminal activity and protecting against or eliminating undesirable community conditions and further finds that such will not infringe upon the protected Constitutional rights of freedom of speech or expression. To that end, this ordinance is hereby adopted.

                  d.  Lessen traffic impacts on surrounding residential areas. 
                  e.  Maximize use of any new and existing communications towers so as to minimize the need to construct new towers and minimize the total number of towers throughout the county; provided, however, that the use of shorter towers of a height which does not require lighting under FAA Regulations will normally be given preference over the use of taller structures even when the use of unlighted structures may require a larger number of towers to serve the county. 
                  f.  Maximize and encourage use of alternative tower structures as a primary option rather than construction of additional single-use towers. 
                  g.  Encourage and promote the location of new communications towers in areas which are not zoned for residential use. 
                  Sec. 333.02. - Definitions related to telecommunications. 
                  Alternative tower and antenna structure. Man-made "trees," clock towers, bell steeples, church steeples, light poles, flag poles and similar alternative-design mounting structures that camouflage or conceal the presence of antennas or towers so as not to be readily discernible as an antenna or tower. In order to establish quantitative and qualitative standards for determining that an alternative tower structure is "not readily discernible," nine examples (photographs) of such "non-readily discernible" structures are included in the appendix to this Development Code. 
                  Antenna. Any exterior apparatus designed for telephonic, radio, or television communications through the sending and/or receiving of electromagnetic waves. 
                  FAA. Federal Aviation Administration.

                  Height of telecommunications tower. When referring to a tower or other structure, the distance measured from ground level to the highest point on the tower or other structure, even if said highest point is an antenna. 
                  Tower. Any structure that is designed and constructed primarily for the purpose of supporting one or more antennas, including self-supporting lattice towers, guy towers, or monopole towers. The term includes radio and television transmission towers, microwave towers, common-carrier towers, cellular telephone towers, alternative tower structures, and the like. 
                  Tower owner. The owner, permittee or lessee of the tower, antennae or associated equipment as well as any parent or subsidiary companies of the foregoing entities. 
                  Sec. 333.03. - Exemptions. 
                  Towers and antennae that are exempted from local regulation by the Federal Communications Commission are exempt from the requirements of this section. These include the following: 
                  a.  Antennae and towers owned and operated by the holder of an amateur radio license issued by the Federal Communications Commission that are less than 70 feet in height are exempt from the requirements of this section. 
                  b.  Personal over-the-air devices for broadcast, cable or satellite television reception, radio broadcast reception, and wireless internet services, are not subject to the requirements of this section. 
                  c.  Satellite ground relay station facilities are not subject to the requirements of this section. 
                  Sec. 333.04. - Where communications towers and antennae may be located. 
                  a.  Upon receipt of an appropriate building permit, free-standing communications towers may be located as a special use within the A-1, B-2 and I zoning districts; provided that the property owner first obtains special use approval from the board of commissioners in accordance with the procedures set forth for special use approval in this Development Code. 
                  b.  Unlighted alternative tower structures, additional antennae mounted on existing communications towers, and antennae located on any nonresidential buildings and alternative tower structures are allowed within the A-1, B-1, B-2, I, OBP and OIP zoning districts, provided that: 
                  (1)  The property owner first obtains a building permit in accordance with the procedures established for commercial building permit applications and plan review; 
                  (2)  Such alternative tower or antenna is set back from any existing or planned off-site residence and separated from any residentially zoned property at least a distance equal to the greater of the required setback for primary uses within the zoning district in which such alternative tower and antenna structure is located or 25 feet; 
                  (3)  The height of the existing free-standing nonresidential structure (other than a tower) on which such tower or antenna is placed will not be increased by more than the lesser of two fifths its existing height or 20 feet. Any structure erected after September 4, 2001 for the purpose of use as an alternative tower or antennae structure shall not exceed 100 feet in height above the existing ground elevation. New structures exceeding 100 feet shall be considered as "towers" as defined herein and shall therefore be subject to the zoning district limitations and special use approval requirements of this Development Code; 
                  (4)  No advertising is permitted on an antenna or tower; 
                  (5)  No signs or lights are permitted on the alternative tower and antenna structures unless such signs or lights lawfully existed prior to erection of the alternative tower structure and will not be modified as a result of same; and 
                  (6)  The number and location of antennae, communications towers or other receiving or transmitting devices located on a single structure is not excessive and does not adversely affect adjacent properties and views. 
                  c.  Prohibitions. No new tower may be established if there is a technically suitable space available on an existing tower within the search area that the new tower is to serve. For the purpose of this section, the search area is defined as the grid for the placement of the antenna. 
                  (Ord. of 9-1-2009, exh. A) 
                  Sec. 333.05. - General requirements. 
                  The requirements set forth in this section shall govern the location and construction of all towers, and the installation of all antennae, governed by this section including alternative tower structures. 
                  a.  Building codes—safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity of towers, the owner, permittee or subsequent lessee of a tower or alternative tower structure shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes and the applicable standards for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries Association, as amended from time to time. Such inspection shall be conducted periodically and at least once every three years. Inspection shall be conducted by a trained and certified tower inspector and reviewed by a professional engineer licensed to practice in the State of Georgia. The tower inspector shall be either a Georgia licensed engineer or a person or firm whose business includes the erections and/or inspections of communications towers. The results of such inspections shall be provided to the board of commissioners or its designee. If, upon inspection, the board of commissioners or its designee concludes that a tower fails to comply with all applicable codes and standards, then upon receipt of written notice by the owner, permittee or lessee of the tower, said party shall have 30 days to bring the tower into compliance with such standards. If the deficiency constitutes an immediate danger to persons or property, then the tower owner shall immediately correct said deficiencies with or without notice from Oconee County. If the owner, permittee or lessee fails to bring the tower into compliance within the 30 days, the governing authority may remove the tower at the owner, permittee or lessee(s) expense. Prior to the removal of any tower, the board of commissioners or its designee may consider detailed plans submitted by the owner, permittee or subsequent lessee for repairs of substandard towers, and may grant a reasonable extension of the above referenced compliance period if no immediate danger exists. 
                  b.  Regulatory compliance. 
                  (1)  All towers and antennae must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC and any other agency of the state or federal government with the authority to regulate communications towers and antennae. If such standards and regulations are changed, then the owners of the communications towers and antennae governed by this section shall bring such communications towers and antennae into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six months of the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a more stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal agency. 
                  (2)  Tower owners shall provide documentation showing that each communications tower is in compliance with all federal requirements. Evidence of compliance must be submitted every 12 months. 
                  c.  Security. Communications towers shall be enclosed by decay resistant security fencing not less than six feet in height and shall be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device; provided however, Oconee County may waive such requirements for alternative tower structures. 
                  d.  Lighting. No illumination is permitted on an antenna or tower unless required by the FCC, FAA or other state or federal agency of competent jurisdiction in which case Oconee County may review lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding uses and views. 
                  e.  Advertising. No advertising is permitted on an antenna or tower. 
                  f.  Visual impact. 
                  (1)  Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA or other applicable federal or state agency, be painted a neutral color, so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness. 
                  (2)  At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and built environment. 
                  (3)  If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible. 
                  (4)  To the extent possible, towers clustered at the same site shall be of similar height and design. 
                  (5)  Towers shall be the minimum height necessary to provide parity with existing similar tower supported antenna, and shall be freestanding unlighted monopole structures where the negative visual effect is less than would be created by use of a guyed tower, self supported lattice tower or taller structure requiring lighting under FAA regulations. 
                  g.  Landscaping. Landscaping shall be used to effectively screen the view of the tower compound from adjacent public ways, public property and residential property and in addition to the buffer requirements of this Development Code shall be as follows: 
                  (1)  For towers 150 feet tall or less, a landscape buffer area no less than ten feet wide shall be provided. The landscape buffer shall be installed around the perimeter of the leased land or around the property solely involving the tower. 
                  (2)  For towers more than 150 feet tall, a landscape buffer area of not less than 20 feet wide shall be provided. The landscape buffer shall be installed around the perimeter of the leased land or around the property solely involving the tower. 
                  (3)  The landscape buffer is to consist of evergreen plant materials of a variety which can be expected to grow to form a continuous buffer at least 15 feet in height within five years of planting and a mature height of at least 25 to 30 feet or more. All landscaping shall be xeriscaped (drought tolerant) or irrigated and properly maintained to ensure good health and viability. Recommended species include, but are not necessarily limited to, Foster Holly, N.R. Stevens' Holly, Carolina Cherry Laurel, Deodar Cedar, Leyland Cypress, Southern Magnolia. A mix of several species is encouraged over mono-culture plantings for visual quality and disease resistance. Buffer planting designs are subject to review and approval by Oconee County. 
                  (4)  Trees and shrubs in the vicinity of guy wires shall be of a kind that would not exceed 20 feet in height or would not affect the stability of the guys, should they be uprooted, and shall not obscure visibility of the anchor from the transmission building or security facilities and staff/maintenance. 
                  (5)  Native vegetation on the site shall be preserved to the greatest practical extent. The applicant shall provide a site plan showing existing significant vegetation to be removed, and vegetation to be replanted to replace that vegetation loss. 
                  (6)  In lieu of these standards, Oconee County may, at its sole discretion, allow use of any alternative detailed plan and specifications for landscape and screening, including plantings, fences, walls and other features designed to screen and buffer towers and accessory uses. The plan shall accomplish the same degree of screening achieved by the provisions above, except as lesser requirements are desirable for adequate visibility for security purposes and/or for continued operation of existing bona fide agricultural or forest uses such as farms, nurseries and tree farms. In certain locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, such as remote agricultural or rural locations or developed heavy industrial areas, the landscaping requirement may be reduced or waived by Oconee County. 
                  h.  Maintenance impacts. Equipment at a transmission facility shall be automated to the greatest extent possible to reduce traffic and congestion. Where the site abuts or has access to a collector and local street, access for maintenance vehicles shall be exclusively by means of the collector street unless approved otherwise for safety reasons. 
                  i.  Principal, accessory and joint uses. 
                  (1)  Accessory structures used in direct support of a tower shall be allowed but not for offices, vehicle storage or other outdoor storage. Mobile or immobile equipment not used in direct support of a tower facility shall not be stored or parked on the site of the tower, unless repairs to the tower are being made. 
                  (2)  Towers may be located on sites containing another principal use in the same buildable area. As long as all of the other siting, setback, separation and general requirements of this Development Code are met, towers may occupy a parcel meeting the minimum lot size requirements for the zoning district in which it is located. Unless approved otherwise, the minimum distance between a tower and other principal use located on the same lot shall be for a monopole or lattice tower the greater of 20 percent of the tower height or 25 feet and for a guy tower, the greater of 100 percent of tower breakpoint or 25 feet. This separation is required to assure compatibility of land uses and to provide for the health, safety and welfare of individuals and structures occupying the same site. 
                  (3)  Joint use of a site is prohibited when a proposed or existing principal use includes the storage, distribution or sale of volatile, flammable, explosive or hazardous materials such as propane, gasoline, natural gas and dangerous chemicals. The board of commissioners or its designee may grant an exception to the foregoing prohibition if the following conditions are met or exist: 
                  (a)  Farm use where the storage of such fuels or chemicals is solely for the purpose of on-site farm activities and is directly related to an ongoing bona fide farming operation for which the owner files a "Schedule F" with the related Federal Income Tax Return; or 
                  (b)  Non-farm uses which meet all of the following conditions: 
                  i.  At least one-hour fire resistant interior surfaces are used in the construction of all buildings. 
                  ii.  Fire extinguishers are on the property. 
                  iii.  Telecommunication facilities are not designed and operated in such a manner so as to minimize the risk of igniting a wildfire or intensifying one that otherwise occurs. 
                  iv.  Graveled areas at least ten feet wide shall be installed completely around all new structures including the telecommunication towers. Fuels are kept in substantial compliance of the Rules and Regulations of the Georgia Safety Fire Commissioner and the Georgia Environmental Protection Division (EPD). 
                  v.  All tree trimmings and trash generated by construction of the facility shall be removed from the property and properly disposed of prior to building permit finalization or commencement of operation, whichever occurs first. 
                  vi.  Demonstration of compliance with requirements of this section 333.05i(3)(b) shall be signed off by a certified fire/safety inspector or engineer in the State of Georgia on the building plans submitted. 
                  j.  Tower lot size, setbacks and separations. 
                  (1)  The site shall be of a size and shape sufficient to provide an adequate setback from the base of the tower to any property line abutting a residential district, public property, or public street. Such setback shall be sufficient to: 
                  (a)  Provide for an adequate vegetative, topographic or other buffer as specified herein; 
                  (b)  Preserve the privacy of surrounding residential property; and 
                  (c)  Protect adjoining property from the potential impact of tower failure by being large enough to accommodate such failure on the site, based on the engineer's analysis required in section 333.08. 
                  (2)  A site is presumed to be of sufficient size when it: 
                  (a)  Meets the requirements of the above section 333.05j(1); 
                  (b)  Provides a setback equal to two times the height of the tower to any property line abutting a residential district, public property, or public street; and 
                  (c)  Provides a setback equal to or exceeding the rear yard setback required for the adjoining property where the adjoining property is not in a residential district nor a public property or a public street. 
                  (3)  Placement of more than one tower on a lot shall be permitted, provided all setback, design and landscape requirements are met as to each tower. Structures may be located as close to each other as technically feasible, provided tower failure characteristics of the towers on the site will not lead to multiple failures in the event that one fails. 
                  (4)  For a guyed structure, the site shall be of a size and shape sufficient to provide a setback equal to at least the height of the tower from a guy anchor to any property line abutting a residential district, public property or public street in addition to the size required to comply with section 333.05j(2) above. Such setback shall be adequate to provide a vegetative, topographic or other buffer sufficient to obscure view to the anchor from such adjoining properties. 
                  (5)  All structures and uses associated with the transmission use other than the transmission tower shall be located to meet the setbacks required in the zoning district where the tower is to be located. To encourage and accommodate shared use of a tower, Oconee County may (but shall not be required to) waive or reduce setback requirements by up to 50 percent to accommodate the placement of additional buildings or other supporting equipment at a tower site. 
                  (6)  All free-standing towers constructed after the effective date of this Development Code shall conform to the following minimum tower separation requirements: 

                   
                  Towers and antennae mounted on rooftops or alternative tower structures may be exempted from these minimum separation distances if so approved by Oconee County.

                  Application for a special use approval or a building permit for any communications tower or use of an alternative tower structure shall be made to the planning department in accordance with this Development Code and established procedures for commercial building permits. An application will not be considered until it is complete. A complete application must contain the following: 
                  a.  Inventory of existing sites. An inventory of the applicant's existing towers that are either within Oconee County, within one mile of the border thereof or provide direct service thereto, including specific information about the location, height, and design of each tower. Oconee County may share such information with other applicants applying for administrative approvals or special use permits under this Development Code or other organizations seeking to locate antennae within the jurisdiction of Oconee County; provided, however, that Oconee County is not, by sharing such information, in any way representing or warranting that such sites are available or suitable. 
                  b.  Site plan or plans to scale specifying the location of tower(s), guy anchors (if any), transmission building and/or other accessory uses, access, parking, fences, landscaped areas, and adjacent land uses.

                  d.  Utilities inventory showing the locations of all water, sewerage, power lines and drainage facilities impacting the proposed tower site. 
                  e.  An environmental impact statement fully describing the effects that the proposed tower and/or antenna will have on the environment and surrounding area including the radiological impact on human health, impacts on adjacent residential structures and districts, impacts on structures and sites of historic significance and impacts on streetscapes. 
                  f.  A certified statement prepared by an engineer licensed to practice in the State of Georgia that the construction of the tower, including reception and transmission functions, will not interfere with the usual and customary transmission or reception of radio, television, etc., service enjoyed by adjacent properties. 
                  g.  A description of anticipated maintenance needs, including frequency of services, personnel needs, equipment needs, and traffic, noise or safety impacts of such maintenance. 
                  h.  Report from a professional structural engineer licensed in the State of Georgia documenting the following: 
                  (1)  Tower height and design, including technical, engineering, economic, and other pertinent factors governing selection of the proposed design. A cross-section of the tower structure shall be included. 
                  (2)  Total anticipated capacity of the structure, including number and types of antennae which can be accommodated. 
                  (3)  Evidence of structural integrity of the tower structure. 
                  (4)  Failure characteristics of the tower and demonstration that site and setbacks are of adequate size to contain debris. 
                  i.  Satisfactory evidence that FAA, FCC and any appropriate state review authority requirements for the proposed tower are met or that the tower is exempt from those regulations. 
                  j.  Letter of intent to lease excess space on the tower structure and to lease additional excess land on the tower site when the shared use potential of the tower is absorbed, if structurally and technically possible. 
                  k.  A reasonable pro rata charge may be made for shared use, consistent with an appropriate sharing of construction, financing and maintenance costs. Fees may also be charged for any structural or RF changes necessitated by such shared use. Such sharing shall be a condition of approval, if approval is granted. 
                  (1)  The applicant shall describe what range of charges are reasonably expected to be assessed against shared users. 
                  (2)  The applicant shall base charges on generally accepted accounting principles and shall explain the elements included in the charge. 
                  l.  The applicant shall quantify the additional tower capacity anticipated, including the approximate number of types of antennae. The applicant shall also describe any limitations on the ability of the tower to accommodate other uses, e.g., radio frequency interference, mass height, frequency or other characteristics. The applicant shall describe the technical options available to overcome those limitations and reasons why the technical options considered were not chosen to be incorporated. Oconee County shall approve those limitations if they cannot be overcome by reasonable technical means. 
                  m.  Evidence of the lack of space on all suitable existing towers to locate the proposed antenna and the lack of space on existing tower sites to construct a tower for the proposed antenna. 
                  n.  Each applicant must make a good faith effort to substantially demonstrate that no existing or planned towers can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna/transmitter as described below: 
                  (1)  The applicant shall contact the owners of all existing or planned towers of a height roughly equal to or greater than the height of the tower proposed by the applicant. A list shall be provided of all owners contacted, the date of such contact, and the form and content of such contact. 
                  (2)  Such contact shall be made in a timely manner; that is, sufficiently before the filing of an application for a building or special use permit to include a response into the application when filed. 
                  (a)  Failure of a listed owner to respond shall not be relevant to the current application if a timely, good faith effort was made to obtain one. However, owners of other such existing or proposed towers to which this section applies shall be required to respond and failure to do so shall constitute a violation of this Development Code and shall void all current and future applications from the tower owner so failing to respond until satisfactory remedy has been made. 
                  (b)  Oconee County shall maintain and provide, on request, records of responses from each owner. 
                  (c)  Once an owner demonstrates an antenna of the sort proposed by the applicant cannot be accommodated on that owner's tower as described below, that owner need not be contacted by future applicants for antennae of the sort proposed. 
                  (3)  The applicant shall request the following information from each owner contacted: 
                  (a)  Identification of the site by location, tax lot number, existing uses, and tower height. 
                  (b)  Whether each such tower could structurally accommodate the antenna proposed by the applicant without requiring that structural changes be made to the tower. To enable the owner to respond, the applicant shall provide each such owner with the height, length, weight, and other relevant data about the proposed antenna. 
                  (c)  Whether each such tower could structurally accommodate the proposed antenna if structural changes were made, not including totally rebuilding the tower. If so, the responding owner shall specify in general terms what structural changes would be required. 
                  (d)  If structurally able, would shared use by such existing tower be precluded for reasons related to RF interference. If so, the owner shall describe in general terms what changes in either the existing or proposed antenna would be required to accommodate the proposed tower, if at all technically possible. 
                  (e)  If shared use is possible, the fee an owner of an existing tower would charge for such shared use. 
                  (4)  Shared use is not precluded simply because a reasonable fee for shared use is charged, or because of reasonable costs necessary to adapt the existing and proposed uses to a shared tower. Oconee County may consider expert testimony to determine whether the fee and costs are reasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development are presumed unreasonable. Oconee County may engage the services of an independent radio frequency engineer or other qualified individual or firm for the purpose of reviewing, evaluating and verifying the radio frequency propagation maps and other information submitted by the applicant. The cost of such services shall be added to the application fees otherwise provided for by this Development Code and other applicable code sections and shall be paid by applicant. 
                  o.  Any other information which may be requested by Oconee County to fully evaluate and review the application and potential impact of a proposed tower and/or antenna. 
                  Sec. 333.09. - Removal of antennae and towers. 
                  All towers and antennae shall be maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable building and technical codes so as to ensure the structural integrity of such towers. If, upon inspection by Oconee County, such tower is determined not to comply with the code standards or to constitute a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to the owner of the tower and the owner of the property, if such owner is different, such owners shall have 30 days to bring such tower into compliance. In the event such tower or antenna is not brought into compliance within 30 days, the county may provide notice to the owners requiring the tower or antenna to be removed. In the event such tower or antenna is not removed within 30 days of receipt of such notice, the county may remove such tower or antenna and place a lien upon the property for the costs of removal. Delay by the county in taking action shall not in any way waive the county's right to take action. The county may pursue all legal remedies available to it to ensure that communications towers and antennae not in compliance with the Development Code or which constitute a danger to persons or property are brought into compliance or removed. The county may seek to have the tower or antenna removed regardless of the owners or operator's intent to operate the tower or antenna and regardless of any permits, federal, state or otherwise, which may have been granted. 
                  Sec. 333.10. - Abandoned towers. 
                  a.  Any antenna or tower that is not operated for a continuous period of 12 months shall be considered abandoned, whether or not the owner or operator intends to make use of the tower. The owner of an abandoned tower and the owner of the property where the tower is located shall be under a duty to remove such a tower or antenna. If such antenna and/or tower is not removed within 60 days of receipt of notice from the county notifying the owner(s) of such abandonment, the county may remove such tower and/or antenna and place a lien upon the property for the costs of removal. The county may pursue all legal remedies available to it to ensure that abandoned communications towers and antennae are removed. Delay by the county in taking action shall not in any way waive the county's right to take action. The county may seek to have the communications tower or antenna removed regardless of the owner's or operator's intent to operate the tower or antenna and regardless of any permits, federal, state or otherwise, which may have been granted. 
                  b.  If the owner of an abandoned tower wishes to use such abandoned tower or antenna, the owner must first apply for [and] receive all applicable permits, and meet all of the conditions of this section as if such tower or antenna were a new tower or antenna. 
                  Sec. 333.11. - Pre-existing towers/nonconforming uses. 
                  a.  All communications towers lawfully operative on the effective date of this Development Code shall be allowed to continue their present usage as a nonconforming use and shall be treated as a nonconforming use in accordance with article 1 of this Development Code. Routine maintenance shall be permitted on such existing towers. New construction, other than routine maintenance on an existing communications tower, shall comply with the requirements of this section. 
                  b.  A communications tower that has received county approval in the form of conditional use and a building permit prior to adoption of this Development Code, but has not yet been constructed or placed in operation, shall be considered an existing tower so long as such approval is current and not expired. 
                  Sec. 333.12. - Public property. 
                  Antennae or towers located on property owned, leased or otherwise controlled by Oconee County shall be exempt from the requirements of this section, provided a license or lease authorizing such antenna or tower has been approved by Oconee County, Georgia.

                  Sec. 406.01. - Minimum lot size established. 
                  The minimum lot area required per dwelling unit on an on-site sewage management system (septic tank) with public water supply is 30,000 square feet, and on a lot with a well water supply is 51,000 square feet. Larger lots may be required as shown on table 4.1 and table 4.4 or as required by this section. 
                  Sec. 406.02. - Lot size increases. 
                  If an on-site sewage management system is proposed to serve a lot or building, the county health department may require larger lot sizes in individual cases based on a variety of factors, 2 [] such as: 
                  a.  The following land areas are not considered as a part of a lot when calculating the required minimum lot size for an on-site sewage management system under state requirements: easements (such as power line or pipe line) that exclude installation of an on-site sewage management system, and land within 50 feet of a lake, river, stream, wetland or other bodies of water. 
                  b.  Such lots located in groundwater recharge areas are subject to increase. See the aquifer recharge area section of the environmental protection article of this Development Code. 
                  c.  The minimum lot area per dwelling shown on table 4.1 may be increased for a home larger than a "typical size home," which is defined as follows: a three- or four-bedroom home with basic appurtenances such as: driveway, minimum number of trees, and water supply line. If larger homes, swimming pools, tennis courts or outbuildings, etc. are proposed to be constructed or if trees would interfere with installation of an on-site sewage management system, the county health department may require larger lots to assure useable soil area. 
                  d.  The county health department may also require larger lot sizes when physical factors indicate the need to do so. These factors include, but are not limited to, the availability of sufficient unobstructed land areas for an approved on-site sewage management system and approved replacement system, slope greater than five percent, percolation rates higher than 45 minutes per inch, need for subsurface drainage or adverse topographic features. 
                  e.  Lots shall be a minimum width of 100 feet or 150 feet measured within the area where an approved on-site sewage management system and replacement system are to be located when served by a public water supply system or non-public water supply system (private well), respectively. 
                  f.  There must be an unobstructed area on each lot for installation of an approved on-site sewage management system and an area equal in size for a conventional system or larger area, as appropriate, for an approved replacement system; this will include sufficient area for necessary site modifications for installation of both the initial system and a replacement system. All pertinent zoning setbacks and other space requirements must also be met. 
                  g.  The maximum daily sewage flow for each lot or parcel of land shall not exceed 600 gallons per acre per day (gpad) when served by non-public or individual water supply system or 1,200 gpad when served by public water supply system. When sewage flows exceed these quantities (600 or 1,200 gpad as indicated) for a given dwelling structure, the minimum lot size or parcel of land shall be increased proportionally following health department guidelines.

                  Sec. 408.02. - Lot width increases. 
                  The lot width required on an individual lot shall be wider than the minimum lot width when one of the following situations occurs: 
                  a.  A corner lot or other lot with multiple frontages shall require an additional width in order to provide an adequate buildable area on the lot. 
                  b.  A greater lot width at the front minimum building setback line shall be required in order to provide adequate lot width where an on-site sewage management system is to be installed, per section 406.02e. 
                  c.  A greater lot width may result from provision of the minimum lot frontage, depending on lotting pattern, or to accommodate topographic or other physical conditions. 
                  Sec. 408.03. - Minimum lot depth. 
                  The minimum lot depth shall be calculated as the mean horizontal distance between the front lot line and the rear lot line. In no case shall the minimum lot depth be smaller than the minimum lot widths required in table 4.5.

                  Sec. 409.03. - Side yard setback reduction. 
                  The side yard setback may be eliminated along interior lot lines of commercial subdivisions to permit the centerline of a joint access easement (private access drive) to straddle the interior lot line(s) provided that the following conditions are met: 
                  a.  The private access drive shall comply with all other applicable provisions of this Development Code, including easement width, pavement width, pavement cross section, landscaping and provisions for drainage and utility easements. 
                  b.  The centerline of the private access drive shall be generally parallel to the affected lot line(s). 
                  c.  The side yard setback (green space) lost to said placement of private access drive shall be replaced by an equal size area of landscaped green space elsewhere on the affected lot(s). Said green space shall be placed on said lot(s) per an approved preliminary plat and/or site development plan and shall be in addition to all other green space and tree planting otherwise required on said lot(s). The green space area relocated under the provisions of this section shall be designed and located in accordance with one or more of the following: 
                  (1)  Where the commercial subdivision abuts property zoned to allow residential use, the green space may be added to the required side yard and planted buffers between the residential and commercial areas. 
                  (2)  Where off-street parking lots are visible from public rights-of-way, the relocated green space may be placed in such a manner as to increase the required buffers and street tree areas between such parking lots and rights-of-way. 
                  (3)  To increase shade tree plantings on the southern and western exposures of parking areas and buildings beyond the tree requirements otherwise required by this Development Code. 
                  (4)  In areas to provide additional filtering of stormwater runoff and to allow for increased absorption thereof. 
                  (5)  Other similar locations as approved by Oconee County. 
                  d.  Nothing contained herein shall be construed to allow the trees and planting islands required in off-street parking lots and the landscaping required between parking lots and public rights-of-way to be relocated elsewhere on the property. This section shall only be applied to side yard setbacks displaced by the aforementioned placement of private access drives. 
                  Sec. 410. - Minimum setbacks; accessory buildings and structures. 
                  Accessory uses or structures shall be permitted only in rear yards and side yards except as otherwise provided in this Code.

                  (Ord. of 9-1-2009, exh. A; Res. of 11-5-2013, exh. A) 
                  Sec. 503.02. - Major subdivisions. 
                  a.  A "major subdivision" is any subdivision that does not qualify as a "minor subdivision." A major subdivision commonly involves the construction of a new street or widening or other improvement of an existing roadway, the provision of stormwater drainage facilities, or the construction or improvement of public utilities, or building sites or other divisions. 
                  b.  Major subdivisions fall into the following categories for the purpose of development regulation: 
                  (1)  Traditional subdivisions, in which the minimum lot size allowed for the zoning district determines the maximum number of lots in the subdivision, and all of the lots meet the minimum lot size for the zoning district as shown on table 4.1 of article 4. Open space outside of the lots may be created, but is not required. 
                  (2)  Conservation subdivisions, in which the maximum number of lots that would be allowed in a traditional subdivision under the property's zoning determines the maximum number of lots in the subdivision, but the minimum lot size is reduced to a certain extent in response to a higher level of development standards and in order to create open space and recreational amenities for the residents. 
                  (3)  Master planned developments (MPDs), in which the zoning district density limitation controls, but the minimum lot size is further reduced in response to a higher level of development standards and in order to create open space and recreational amenities for the residents. Depending on the zoning district in which a master planned development is located, flexibility in housing types, mixed-use projects and certain commercial uses are allowed. 
                  (4)  Planned unit developments (PUDs). A new planned unit development may no longer be approved under this Development Code. Provisions related to PUDs are included in this article to regulate the build-out of existing PUDs. 
                  c.  Conservation easement required. 
                  (1)  All primary conservation areas in a traditional subdivision, conservation subdivision or master planned development that are required to be protected by the provisions of this Development Code, shall be permanently protected from further subdivision, development, and unauthorized use, by a conservation easement in an conservation subdivision or master planned development, or a natural resources easement for traditional subdivisions. 
                  (2)  Land within natural resource easements may be included within the lots in a subdivision, or ownership may be transferred to a Homeowner's Association or to a nonprofit conservation organization or land trust organized under Georgia law. 
                  (3)  See the environmental protection article of this Code regarding conservation and natural resource easements. 
                  (Ord. of 9-1-2009, exh. A) 
                  Sec. 504. - Traditional subdivisions. 
                  Sec. 504.01. - Maximum number of lots. 
                  The maximum number of lots (or dwelling units) in a traditional subdivision shall be determined by the minimum lot size required for the zoning district where the subdivision is located. 
                  Sec. 504.02. - Minimum lot size. 
                  In a traditional subdivision, the minimum total lot area and the minimum lot area per dwelling unit required by table 4.1 of article 4 establishes the minimum lot sizes for each lot. 
                  Sec. 504.03. - Minimum lot width, setbacks. 
                  The lot width and setback requirements of article 4 apply to each lot in a traditional subdivision. 
                  Sec. 505. - Conservation subdivisions. 
                  Conservation subdivisions, as defined herein, are permitted within the AR-5, AR-4, AR-3, AR-2 and AR-1 zoning districts; provided that a conservation subdivision concept plan has been approved by the board of commissioners at the time of rezoning of the property. In the case of property that was rezoned prior to the date of adoption of this amendment, the preliminary plat for said conservation subdivision shall be forwarded to the board of commissioners for review and approval prior to construction plan submittal. 
                  Sec. 505.01. - Purpose. 
                  The purposes of a conservation subdivision include: 
                  a.  To provide residential subdivisions which permit flexibility of design in order to preserve environmentally sensitive areas and create efficient uses of the land. 
                  b.  To preserve open space and unique or sensitive natural resources such as groundwater, floodplains, wetlands, streams, steep slopes, woodlands, wildlife habitats, historic features and unique topography. 
                  c.  To permit clustering of houses and structures on less environmentally sensitive soils, which will reduce the amount of infrastructure, including paved surfaces, utilities, earthwork and other land disturbing activities. 
                  d.  To reduce erosion and sedimentation by minimizing land disturbance and removal of vegetation in residential developments. 
                  e.  To conserve a portion of the otherwise developable property as open space in perpetuity. This option is not necessarily intended to allow applicant to conserve only the portion of the tract that is already unbuildable due to factors such as steep slopes, wetlands, or land adjacent to undesirable areas such as landfills or livestock farming. 
                  f.  To promote interconnected greenways and corridors throughout Oconee County. 
                  g.  To promote linking of greenways and corridors between Oconee County and neighboring jurisdictions. 
                  h.  To encourage interaction of persons living in the resulting residential community by clustering houses and orienting them closer to the street, providing public gathering places and encouraging use of parks and community facilities as focal points in the neighborhood. 
                  i.  To encourage street designs that reduce traffic speeds and reliance on main arteries. 
                  j.  To incorporate aesthetic design standards that will increase the value of the neighborhood and create a sense of place. 
                  k.  To conserve scenic views and reduce perceived density by promoting views to open space from roads and houses, and reducing views to housing clusters from roadways. 
                  l.  To promote other purposes of the zoning regulations, land subdivision regulations, soil erosion and sediment control ordinance and other ordinances and policies of Oconee County. 
                  Sec. 505.02. - Minimum lot sizes and buffer widths, conservation subdivisions. 
                  a.  The following table 5.1 shows the minimum lot sizes required in the AR zoning districts in traditional subdivisions, and the minimums allowed in a conservation subdivision in the same zoning districts: 

                   
                  1 See the Lot Building Standards Article for minimum lot area required above the flood level. 
                  b.  The following table 5.2 shows the minimum landscape buffer area width required in a conservation subdivision between the lots within the subdivision and an adjoining existing public road right-of-way: 

                   
                  Sec. 505.03. - Yield plan. 
                  No later than the time of rezone (or preliminary plat submittal, in the case of property which was rezoned prior to the date of adoption of these requirements), the applicant for a conservation subdivision shall submit a yield plan at the same size as the conservation concept plan, prepared by a Georgia registered landscape architect, engineer or land surveyor for the purpose of determining the maximum allowable net density for the development. Said plan shall contain the following information with respect to the tract:

                  Sec. 505.04. - Site analysis map. 
                  No later than the time of rezone (or preliminary plat submittal, in the case of property which was rezoned prior to the date of adoption of this amendment) applicant shall submit a site analysis map which demonstrates that the tract is suitable for development in terms of size, environmental conditions and configuration. Said map shall contain the following information with respect to the tract: 
                  a.  Topographic contours at five-foot intervals. Rock outcrops and slopes of more than 15 percent shall be emphasized; 
                  b.  Soil types, locations and characteristics (level III report) such as depth to bedrock, seasonal high water table and suitability for waste water disposal systems;

                  Sec. 505.05. - Preliminary plat; conservation subdivision. 
                  Based on the density determined by the yield plan, and based on open space areas from the site analysis plan, applicant shall submit a conservation subdivision preliminary plat in accordance with the procedures and permits article of this Development Code, showing the lots, streets, open space, recreation areas and other requirements for preliminary plats. 
                  Sec. 505.06. - Open space standards. 
                  a.  Minimum area. The minimum area of open space preserved shall be determined by the net density from the yield plan and the actual lot size. For example: if the net density for a 50-acre AR-2 property computes to be one lot per 2.38 acres (21 lots) and the average lot size is one acre, then 21 acres will be in lots, about 2.5 acres in right-of-way and the remaining 26 acres will be in perpetual open space. This will vary from one subdivision to the next but open space shall be at least 50 percent or more of the total site. 
                  b.  Physiographic characteristics. The types of land area included in the open space shall include all primary conservations areas and such secondary conservation areas as appropriate. See the environmental protection article of this Development Code for descriptions of conservation areas. 
                  c.  The open space shall be an integrated part of the project rather than an isolated element and fragmentation of the open space shall be minimized. Individual open space parcels generally shall be larger than three acres, have a length to width ratio of no less than 4:1 and a width of at least 75 feet. Exceptions may be made for entrances to trails and other particular uses as deemed appropriate by the county. 
                  d.  The open space shall be directly accessible to the largest practical number of lots within the subdivision. Non-adjoining lots shall be provided with safe, convenient access to the open space. 
                  e.  Where practical, open space areas shall also be configured to provide a landscape buffer between adjoining property outside the conservation subdivision and the house sites within the subdivision. With the exception of approved fences and signs, a 50 foot landscape buffer shall be maintained between structures and the exterior boundaries of the subdivision. The intent is to decrease potential conflicts between various land uses (e.g., residential vs. agricultural uses). 
                  f.  See also the open space ownership and management requirements of section 508. 
                  Sec. 506. - Master planned developments. 
                  Sec. 506.01. - General requirements. 
                  a.  A master planned development (MPD) may be approved in any of the zoning districts shown on table 5.3. 
                  b.  All master planned developments require concept plan approval by the board of commissioners as a zoning change. 
                  c.  A concept plan for a master planned development shall be reviewed by the development review committee for recommendations, and shall follow the procedures for concept plan review under the procedures and permits article of this Development Code for approval or modification. 
                  d.  The provisions of this section apply to all master planned developments in lieu of the requirements of the zoning district in which the MPD is located. Where no provisions to the contrary are included in this article, the requirements of the applicable zoning district shall apply. 
                  Sec. 506.02. - Criteria for approval. 
                  a.  A master planned development must comply with the open space, residential development standards and nonresidential development standards of section 506.14 as a prerequisite for approval. 
                  b.  The provisions of this article are intended to encourage the development of master planned developments in appropriate locations that allow the use of innovative techniques, such as traditional neighborhood design, open space subdivisions, village concepts and mixed use development. Such master planned developments should be brought together as a compatible and unified development by allowing flexibility within the current zoning regulations. 
                  c.  Benefits of master planned developments include innovative design, the protection and accommodation of important natural resources and open space within the county, and the cost savings of less infrastructure. MPDs are reviewed individually to determine compatibility, suitability, and health, safety and welfare issues. Individual requirements relating to such developments become part of the site through conditions of concept plan approval. 
                  d.  Review criteria. The following is a list of criteria that will be used by the county to determine the suitability of a proposed master planned development: 
                  (1)  The uses proposed will not be detrimental to present surrounding uses and potential surrounding development as shown on the future land use plan; 
                  (2)  Exceptions from the lot area, setback and other development standards of the zoning district applicable to the subject property are warranted by the design and amenities incorporated in the development plan; 
                  (3)  Land surrounding the proposed development can be planned in coordination with the proposed development and will be compatible in use; 
                  (4)  Water and sewer system extensions and improvements must be proposed in a manner consistent with the county's strategies for water and sewer and the development must be compatible with the transportation master plans at the time of application; and 
                  (5)  The master planned development must be in conformance with the general intent of this Development Code and the comprehensive plan. Proposed MPDs must have a portion of their gross land area within the comprehensive plan future land use map land use categories as shown on table 5.3, and have its primary entrance located within three-fourths road miles of the future land use map land use categories shown on the same table. 

                   
                  Note: "Residential" does not include the "low density residential" category. 
                  (6)  Every master planned development must be deemed by the board of commissioners to incorporate features of exceptional architectural, landscaping or site design prior to master planned development approval. Such plans upon which this determination is made shall be incorporated into the master planned development approval of the project. 
                  Sec. 506.03. - Development parameters. 
                  The following general conditions apply to master planned developments according to the zoning district of the property: 
                  a.  General requirements. 
                  (1)  A master planned development must contain at least 50 contiguous acres; provided, however, that nothing herein shall preclude the expansion of an MPD which has been approved after the date of adoption of this amendment by the addition of contiguous properties which are smaller than 50 acres, provided the rezoning of said contiguous properties and the original MPD is approved in accordance with applicable regulations. 
                  (2)  The primary access (i.e., main entrance) to the master planned development must be from an arterial or major collector road as defined in this Development Code. 
                  (3)  The master planned development must be served by public water and a sanitary sewerage and treatment system approved by the board of commissioners. 
                  b.  The proportion and distribution of nonresidential to residential uses in a master planned development is determined by the zoning category of the property and the maximum density proposed. The underlying zoning district also determines the maximum number of dwelling units and the type of commercial development that can be allowed in the master planned development. These limitations and the distribution of housing types are shown on table 5.4. 

                   
                  c.  Commercial uses. 
                  (1)  When "general commercial" is allowed, development of the commercial area shall be controlled by the B-1 zoning district provisions, except as modified by this article and restricted by table 5.5. 
                  (2)  When "highway commercial" is allowed, development of the commercial area shall be controlled by the B-2 zoning district provisions, except as modified by this article and restricted by table 5.5. 
                  (3)  Accessory commercial uses, such as a sales office, maintenance office or resident manager, are allowed within any individual development to which they are normally incidental. 
                  (4)  Commercial structures and uses that are incorporated into a master planned development must be located and designed as an integral part of the unified development. As an addition to the B-1 and B-2 district provisions, residential and commercial uses may either be located in freestanding buildings within a site, or combined together within the same building. 
                  (5)  Development of the commercial floor area shall precede or occur in conjunction with residential development of the MPD in direct proportion to the number of dwelling units approved for each development phase as follows: 
                  (a)  No more than one half of the total number of residential lots, houses or units may be final platted or permitted (building permits issued) until at least one half of the commercial lots or commercial buildings (floor space) have been final platted and constructed (including the completion of all infrastructure, exterior walls, roofs, exterior building finish, parking areas, sidewalks, landscaping, lighting and buffers associated with said one half of the commercial use). 
                  (b)  Upon final platting and construction of a least one half of the commercial lots and buildings (floor space) (including the completion of all infrastructure, exterior walls, roofs, exterior building finish, parking areas, sidewalks, landscaping, lighting and buffers associated with said one half of the commercial use), the remainder of the residential component of the MPD may be final platted and building permits issued. 

                   
                  d.  Development is to be carefully planned to ensure that the benefits of master planned developments are fully realized and potential negative impacts of one use on another are minimized, both within the development and along its periphery. Factors include separation of mixed-use areas from single-use areas, pedestrian access linkages, placement of open space and community amenities to define neighborhoods and provide community focus, peripheral buffers and transitions in use or intensity approaching the MPD boundary. The denser portions of the residential component and the active amenity areas such as pools, tennis, basketball and other recreational uses should be located internally and the less dense residential areas should be on the periphery of the developed areas. 
                  e.  All master planned developments must provide internal pedestrian access, including connections to external access points. The type of access such as sidewalks, bike paths, lanes, and trails will be established during the review period to determine the best way to serve a particular development. 
                  Sec. 506.04. - Maximum number of dwelling units. 
                  The total number of dwelling units for all types of housing allowed in a master planned development is determined by multiplying the maximum density shown on table 5.4 for the underlying zoning district times the gross residential acreage of the property (excluding any acreage to be used for commercial development). Individual portions may exceed this density in accordance with the approved concept plan for the MPD, provided that the maximum density of the entire project is not exceeded. 
                  Sec. 506.05. - Minimum lot size. 
                  The following establishes the amount of land to be set aside for each dwelling unit, whether in individual lots or within a property containing condominium or multi-family units. Street rights-of-way, private street easements, landscape buffers and stream buffers, and utility easements are not to be included in lot areas when calculating minimum lot sizes. 
                  a.  For a single-family detached or duplex dwelling average 15,000 (minimum 5,000) square feet per dwelling unit in the R-1 zoning district, average 7,500 (minimum 5,000) square feet per dwelling unit in the R-2 zoning district, and minimum 5,000 square feet per dwelling unit in the R-3, B-1 and B-2 zoning districts. 
                  b.  For multi-family dwellings (including townhouses) the average lot area shall be 4,000 square feet. For a townhouse condominium or apartment development intended to occupy a single property, the property shall contain a minimum total area equal to the number of dwelling units times 4,000 square feet. 
                  Sec. 506.06. - Minimum lot widths. 
                  The minimum lot widths for lots in any master planned development shall be as established on the concept plan approved for the MPD. 
                  Sec. 506.07. - Minimum setbacks. 
                  The minimum setbacks for principal buildings in any master planned development shall be as established on the concept plan approved for the MPD. 
                  Sec. 506.08. - Minimum dwelling unit floor area. 
                  The minimum floor area for dwelling units in any master planned development shall be as established on the concept plan approved for the MPD. 
                  Sec. 506.09. - Internal orientation required. 
                  All single-family residential lots within a master planned development must front upon and gain their access from a proposed street within the development, provided that any lot fronting upon and gaining its access from an existing county street or road shall comply with the dimensional standards of the zoning district within which the master planned development is located. 
                  Sec. 506.10. - Minimum separation from adjoining streets. 
                  The single-family residential lots within an R-1 master planned development meeting the reduced dimensional standards for a master planned development must be separated from every existing county road or street right-of-way that adjoins the development by a buffer described in section 506.11. All townhouse projects within an R-1 or R-2 master planned development must be separated from every existing county road or street right-of-way that adjoins the development by a 100-foot wide landscape buffer if no single family detached residential or commercial uses are located between the townhouses and the existing county road or street. 
                  Sec. 506.11. - Buffer requirements. 
                  a.  A permanent landscape buffer area shall be established along the perimeter of any master planned development where it adjoins an agricultural or residential zoning district. Except for a fence, wall or earthen berm along the property line, and necessary utility crossings generally perpendicular, the buffers shall remain undisturbed and no structure of any type shall be permitted in the buffer area. Buffers shall conform to the buffer design standards (except for width) of the landscaping and buffers article of this Development Code. Buffer widths along the perimeter of the MPD shall be no less than the dimensions shown on table 5.6. Where supplemental planting, berms, walls, fences or other installations are provided in order to meet the buffer performance standards, then said improvements shall be installed at the same time as the infrastructure, (roads, water and wastewater facilities, earthwork and stormwater improvements) in each phase of the development. 

                   
                  b.  Internal landscape buffers as would otherwise be required by this Development Code between land use areas within a master planned development may be waived, subject to conditions of approval for the master planned development concept plan. However, conservation corridors shown on the future land use plan shall be protected by a 100-foot wide natural undisturbed buffer except that necessary crossings for roads and utility lines shall be permitted if approved by the board of commissioners on rezone concept plans. Stormwater detention areas shall not be constructed within said undisturbed buffers. 
                  Sec. 506.12. - Ownership control. 
                  a.  All of the land in a master planned development initially shall be in single ownership by an individual, a partnership, tenants in common, a corporation or by some other legal entity. 
                  b.  See the open space ownership and management requirements of section 508. 
                  Sec. 506.13. - Concept plan. 
                  Development of a master planned development shall be guided by an approved concept plan for the overall project. See the procedural requirements for MPDs in the procedures and permits article of this Development Code for details. 
                  Sec. 506.14. - Quality development standards. 
                  In order for a master planned development to be approved, the development must meet or exceed the standards of this section. 
                  a.  Common open space. Acreage not utilized for residential lots, roadway access and utilities shall be placed in common open space or devoted to recreation amenities. 
                  (1)  A minimum percent of the gross project site area shall be reserved for common open space, as follows: no less than 20 percent of the total site must be set aside as open space for conservation, preservation or passive recreational use, such as walking trails and picnicking. Valuable natural resources and required stream buffers are to be given preference for inclusion in the minimum required open space. Land devoted to stormwater detention facilities may not be counted toward the 20 percent minimum unless the facility is a permanent lake or pond and is designed and intended for recreational access and use by the occupants of the development. 
                  (2)  Additional common open space may be provided and may include active recreation areas for the proposed development, such as swimming pools, tennis courts, community facilities, basketball, field sports, etc. However, these areas shall not be counted towards the 20 percent open space required above. 
                  (3)  Required buffers on the perimeter of the property may be included in the minimum open space requirement. 
                  (4)  While common open space shall not be required to be contiguous, no individual portion of the open space that counts toward the 20 percent minimum shall be less than one acre in size, nor less than 50 feet wide in its narrowest dimension, except as follows: the open space area, by the very nature of its designated boundaries, is less than 50 feet in width. Examples include strips of steep slopes and "fingers" of floodplains that extend up drainage swales. 
                  (5)  No portion of the residential lots shall be credited toward the minimum open space requirement unless the portion is included within a conservation easement. No portion of any street right-of-way or public or private utility easement shall be credited toward the minimum open space requirement. 
                  (6)  The required common open space shall be platted at the same time that adjacent residential lots are platted, in whole or in phases, in accordance with the phasing approved as part of the concept plan for the MPD. 
                  (7)  Jurisdictional wetlands shall be included in the protected open space areas but the area of said wetlands shall not be counted toward the percentage of required open space area for the MPD. 
                  b.  Residential development standards. 
                  (1)  The subdivision must be served by a sanitary sewerage collection and treatment system approved by the county utilities and public works departments. 
                  (2)  Recreation amenity. In addition to the minimum required common open space, every subdivision must contain a community recreation amenity of adequate size or variety to serve the development, such as a community pool, picnic pavilion, tennis courts, children's playground or basketball courts, as deemed appropriate by the developer and board of commissioners and approved as part of the MPD concept plan. Such amenities should be substantial in nature and should include a major component such as a swimming pool and accessory uses such as parking, children's play areas, tennis or other similar improvements and landscaping. 
                  (3)  Private open space required. Every single-family or two-family dwelling unit on a lot of less than 10,000 square feet shall have a minimum 400 square foot private yard or patio. Every townhouse unit shall have a minimum 200 square foot private yard or patio. 
                  (a)  The private yard or patio shall be arranged for use by the occupants of the dwelling and located in the side or rear yard. 
                  (b)  The private yard or patio must be enclosed by any combination of the following: a masonry wall, wood fence, trellis or lattice with a minimum height of six feet; or an evergreen hedge, shrubs or trees that will achieve a height of six feet within three years of planting under normal growing conditions. 
                  (4)  Lots within the development shall be serviced with underground utilities (electric power, natural gas, telephone, TV cable, etc.). 
                  (5)  The developer shall provide architectural renderings of proposed structures to be reviewed and approved by the board of commissioners as part of the concept plan or prior to each preliminary subdivision plat or preliminary site plan approval. 
                  (6)  All dwelling units shall have facades that consist primarily of brick, stucco or stone finish, with minimal lap siding consisting of premium vinyl (subject to the standards of section 506.14d), painted wood lap or fiber cement board siding; or as otherwise approved as part of the MPD approval by the board of commissioners. 
                  (7)  Each single-family detached and duplex dwelling unit shall include at least a two-car garage. Unless waived by the board of commissioners as part of the MPD approval, each townhouse unit must also include a minimum two car garage. Wider streets with on-street parking may be considered on private streets in lieu of on-site parking. 
                  c.  Nonresidential development standards. Restrictions within through-road corridors apply to all commercial and institutional uses within a master planned development. 
                  (1)  Through-road corridor defined. Land lying along and within 200 feet of the right-of-way of a public street or highway that adjoins or traverses a MPD and that provides for movement of through traffic (in contrast to internal local streets) shall constitute a through-road corridor. 
                  (2)  Any commercial, office or institutional property or portion of a property within the MPD that is located within a through-road corridor shall comply with the following special design standards: 
                  (a)  Building setbacks. No principal or accessory building shall be located less than 50 feet from the right-of-way of a through road unless a reduced setback is approved by the board of commissioners as part of the MPD concept plan. This entire setback area shall be landscaped and may not include any parking or other accessory uses other than access driveways. 
                  (b)  Signage. Canopy signs are prohibited. 
                  (c)  Landscaping. Any property or portion of a property that is located within a through-road corridor shall provide at least 20 percent of its gross land area in landscaping. Landscape areas and treatments shall be identified on the site plan for the development, subject to approval by the county. 
                  (d)  Building materials and architectural standards. 
                  i.  The exterior walls of any building that is located within a through-road corridor and/or is visible from a through-road corridor shall be of masonry, stucco, or lap siding consisting of premium vinyl (subject to the standards of section 506.14d), painted wood lap or fiber cement board siding; or shall otherwise be consistent with and complementary to existing architecture in the general area. These finish building materials shall be applied to all sides of the building visible from the through road. Colors and materials shall be harmonious and compatible with colors of other buildings within and immediately adjacent to the district. Material colors shall be natural, muted earth tones, gray or muted red color brick, stone, and/or neutral shades of concrete. Bright or accent colors may be used with discretion where appropriate on ornamental locations on the building's exterior, but shall not be used as the primary building material color. 
                  ii.  No buildings with metal exterior facades will be permitted within the corridor nor shall any metal facade buildings be visible from the corridor. Metal roofs, including mansard roofs, are not considered part of a facade. 
                  iii.  Quality architectural standards and site design elements shall be given high priority in the design of the commercial portions of the MPD. Emphasis on brick exteriors is encouraged. Architectural accents utilizing brick, premium vinyl (subject to the standards of section 506.14d), wood and cement board siding details, bay windows, sloped roofs, dormers, columns, covered porches, vertical accent details, variations in the plane of the front building walls and other similar amenities are examples of such desirable architectural features. Quality site design features include but are not necessarily limited to textured and colored paving accents, sidewalk planters in front of the buildings, outdoor seating areas, decorative site furnishings and lighting fixtures, fountains, arbors, numerous large shade trees and substantial shrub, ground cover and flowering plants. 
                  d.  Standards for vinyl siding. Vinyl siding used for any application in an MPD must meet or exceed the following requirements and standards: 
                  (1)  Materials. Vinyl siding shall consist of PVC (rigid poly(vinyl chloride)) or polypropylene material that is no less than 0.044 inches thick (whether or not foam backed) and shall be certified by the manufacturer as otherwise meeting or exceeding the standard specifications of ASTM D3679 for rigid poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) siding, as most currently adopted or revised by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM). 
                  (2)  Vinyl siding products. Vinyl siding products shall have the following specifications:

                  Sec. 506.15 - Master planned developments existing as of April 5, 2005. 
                  No property rezoned to a master planned development classification prior to April 5, 2005 shall be expanded, amended or modified so as to allow an increase in the total number of building unit, lots, density nor to reduce the amount of greenspace or open space required by this code. All such property shall otherwise be subject to the provisions of and comply with the MPD regulations in effect on April 4, 2005, which are attached to this article as "Addendum A". (Attached) 
                  Addendum A 
                  Regulations pertaining to master planned developments existing as of April 4, 2005, as provided by section 506.15. 
                  Master planned developments. 
                  General requirements. 
                  a.  A master planned development (MPD) may be approved in any of the zoning districts shown on Table 14.1. 
                  b.  All master planned developments require concept plan approval by the board of commissioners as a zoning change. 
                  c.  A concept plan for a master planned development shall be reviewed by the development review committee for recommendations, and shall follow the procedures for concept plan review under section 1704.1 of these zoning regulations for planning commission recommendation and board of commissioners approval. 
                  d.  The provisions of this article apply to all master planned developments in lieu of the requirements of the zoning district in which the MPD is located. Where no provisions to the contrary are included in this article, the requirements of the applicable zoning district shall apply. 
                  Criteria for approval. 
                  a.  A master planned development must comply with the open space, residential development standards and nonresidential development standards of 0 as a prerequisite for approval. 
                  b.  The provisions of this article are intended to encourage the development of master planned developments in appropriate locations that allow the use of innovative techniques, such as traditional neighborhood design, open space subdivisions, village concepts and mixed use development. Such master planned developments should be brought together as a compatible and unified development by allowing flexibility within the current zoning regulations. 
                  c.  Benefits of master planned developments include innovative design, the protection and accommodation of important natural resources and open space within the county, and the cost savings of less infrastructure. MPDs are reviewed individually to determine compatibility, suitability, and health, safety and welfare issues. Individual requirements relating to such developments become part of the site through conditions of concept plan approval. 
                  d.  Review criteria. The following is a list of criteria that will be used by the county to determine the suitability of a proposed master planned development: 
                  (1)  The uses proposed will not be detrimental to present surrounding uses and potential surrounding development as shown on the future land use plan; 
                  (2)  Exceptions from the lot area, setback and other development standards of zoning district applicable to the subject property in these zoning regulations are warranted by the design and amenities incorporated in the development plan; 
                  (3)  Land surrounding the proposed development can be planned in coordination with the proposed development and will be compatible in use; 
                  (4)  The master planned development is in conformance with the general intent of these zoning regulations and the comprehensive plan; and 
                  (5)  Every master planned development must be deemed by the board of commissioners to incorporate features of exceptional architectural, landscaping or site design prior to master planned development approval. Such plans upon which this determination is made shall be incorporated into the master planned development approval of the project. 
                  Development parameters. 
                  The following general conditions apply to master planned developments according to the zoning district of the property: 
                  a.  The proportion and distribution of nonresidential to residential uses in a master planned development is determined by the zoning category of the property and the maximum density proposed. The underlying zoning district also determines the maximum number of dwelling units and the type of commercial development that can be allowed in the master planned development. These limitations and the distribution of housing types are shown on Table 14.1. 
                  b.  When "general commercial" is allowed, development of the commercial area shall be controlled by the B-1 zoning district provisions, except as modified by this article. 
                  c.  When "highway commercial" is allowed, development of the commercial area shall be controlled by the B-2 zoning district provisions, except as modified by this article. 
                  d.  Accessory commercial uses, such as a sales office, maintenance office or resident manager, are allowed within any individual development to which they are normally incidental. 
                  e.  Commercial structures and uses that are incorporated into a master planned development must be located and designed as an integral part of the unified development. As an addition to the B-1 and B-2 district provisions, residential and commercial uses may either be located in freestanding buildings within a site, or combined together within the same building. 

                   
                  f.  Development is to be carefully planned to ensure that the benefits of master planned developments are fully realized and potential negative impacts of one use on another are minimized, both within the development and along its periphery. Factors include separation of mixed-use areas from single-use areas, pedestrian access linkages, placement of open space and community amenities to define neighborhoods and provide community focus, peripheral buffers and transitions in use or intensity approaching the MPD boundary. 
                  g.  All master planned developments must provide internal pedestrian access, including connections to external access points. The type of access such as sidewalks, bike paths, lanes, and trails will be established during the review period to determine the best way to serve a particular development. 
                  Maximum number of dwelling units. 
                  The total number of dwelling units for all types of housing allowed in a master planned development is determined by multiplying the maximum density shown on Table 14.1 for the underlying zoning district times the gross acreage of the entire property. Individual portions may exceed this density in accordance with the approved concept plan for the MPD, provided that the maximum density of the entire project is not exceeded. 
                  Minimum lot size. 
                  The following establishes the amount of land to be set aside for each dwelling unit, whether in individual lots or within a property containing condominium or multifamily units: 
                  a.  A single-family detached or duplex dwelling on an individual well and septic tank or on public water and septic tank must provide the lot area per dwelling unit required by Article XIII, or a larger area per dwelling unit if required to meet health department standards. 
                  b.  For a single-family detached or duplex dwelling on public water and a sanitary sewer collection and treatment system - average 15,000 (minimum 5,000) square feet per dwelling unit in the R-1 zoning district, average 7,500 (minimum 5,000) square feet per dwelling unit in the R-2 zoning district, and average 5,000 square feet per dwelling unit in the R-3, B-1 and B-2 zoning districts. 
                  c.  For multifamily dwellings (including townhouses) the average lot area shall be 4,000 square feet. For a townhouse condominium or apartment development intended to occupy a single property, the property shall contain a minimum total area equal to the number of dwelling units times 4,000 square feet. A sanitary sewer collection and treatment system is required for any such project. 
                  Minimum lot widths. 
                  The minimum lot widths for lots in any master planned development shall be as established on the concept plan approved for the MPD. 
                  Minimum setbacks. 
                  The minimum setbacks for principal buildings for any master planned development shall be as established on the concept plan approved for the MPD. 
                  Internal orientation required. 
                  All single-family residential lots within a master planned development must front upon and gain their access from a proposed street within the development, provided that any lot fronting upon and gaining its access from an existing county street or road shall comply with the dimensional standards of the zoning district within which the master planned development is located. 
                  Minimum separation from adjoining streets. 
                  The single-family residential lots within an R-1 master planned development meeting the reduced dimensional standards for a master planned development must be separated from every existing county road or street right-of way that adjoins the development by a 50-foot wide buffer or 200-foot wide building setback. All townhouse projects within an R-1 or R-2 master planned development must be separated from every existing county road or street right-of-way that adjoins the development by a 100-foot wide buffer if no residential or commercial uses are located between the townhouses and the existing county road or street. 
                  Buffer requirements. 
                  a.  A permanent 50-foot buffer area shall be established around the perimeter of any master planned development where it adjoins an agricultural, agricultural/residential or residential zoning district. Except for a fence, wall or earthen berm along the property line, no structure of any type shall be permitted in the buffer area. 
                  b.  Internal buffers as would otherwise be required by this zoning ordinance between land use areas within a master planned development may be waived, subject to conditions of approval for the master planned development concept plan. 
                  Ownership control. 
                  a.  All of the land in a master planned development initially shall be in single ownership by an individual, a partnership, tenants in common, a corporation or by some other legal entity. 
                  b.  The use of common open space and other common areas shall be governed by an owner's association meeting the requirements of zero. 
                  Concept plan. 
                  a.  Concept plan; administration. 
                  (1)  Development of a master planned development shall be guided by an approved concept plan for the overall project. Prior to any land development activity or the issuance of a building permit, the concept plan shall have been approved by the board of commissioners, and subsequent development must substantially conform to the approved concept plan. 
                  (2)  The level of detail to be shown on a master planned development concept plan shall reflect the scale of the proposed project. For a mixed-use master planned development, the various areas by housing type and land use category are to be identified and the parameters of development identified for each area. A master planned development involving only one type of housing would present more detail regarding the layout of the development. 
                  (a)  The concept plan for a master planned development involving only one type of housing shall conform to the requirements for a "concept plan" under section 1704.1. 
                  (b)  The concept plan for a mixed-use master planned development must designate the type of development planned for each area. The concept plan shall illustrate the individual lot lines within each subdivision and the building outlines in each condominium, multifamily or nonresidential project, and must conform to the requirements for a "concept plan" under section 1704.1. 
                  b.  Impact analyses. 
                  (1)  Zoning impact analysis. Every initially proposed master planned development concept plan shall be accompanied by a narrative specifically addressing each of the standards set forth in these zoning regulations under section 1705. 
                  (2)  Traffic impact analysis. 
                  (a)  Every initially proposed master planned development concept plan that is capable of generating 1,000 average daily vehicle trips or more shall be accompanied by a traffic analysis prepared under guidelines available from the county engineer. Anticipated vehicle trips may be based upon the latest edition of Trip Generation published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers. 
                  (b)  A traffic analysis shall also be required for a proposed modification to a previously approved concept plan if the average daily vehicle trips will increase by ten percent or more than calculated for the original concept plan, or average daily vehicle trips will exceed 1,000 for the first time. 
                  (c)  For MPDs with less than 1,000 average daily vehicle trips or increases of less than ten percent, the county engineer may require a traffic analysis when conditions on the public street system warrant. 
                  c.  Site plans and subdivision plats. 
                  (1)  Approvals of individual projects within a master planned development are to follow the county's normal development approval process, based on preliminary site plans or preliminary subdivision plats as normally required. Each preliminary site plan or preliminary subdivision plat is to be consistent with the approved concept plan for the master planned development. 
                  (2)  Approval for construction of individual projects within a master planned development are to follow the county's normal approval process of engineering drawings through the development review committee. 
                  d.  Modifications to the concept plan. Development of each portion of a master planned development must substantially conform to the concept plan approved by the board of commissioners. If any preliminary site plan or preliminary subdivision plat is proposed that does not substantially conform, the concept plan must first be modified before the preliminary site plan or preliminary subdivision plat can be approved. Modifications of the concept plan can only be approved by the board of commissioners, following the same procedure as the initial approval of the original concept plan under section 1704.1. 
                  e.  Concept plan updates required. The master planned development concept plan is to be updated as individual site plans are approved for construction or final subdivision plats are recorded. Updating is an administrative process for submission to the planning department, and is intended to provide a record of the master planned development as build-out progresses. No update will be allowed that does not substantially conform to the approved concept plan, or that has not been approved as a modification to the concept plan by the board of commissioners. 
                  Quality development standards. 
                  In order for a master planned development to be approved, the development must meet or exceed the standards of this section. 
                  a.  Common open space. Acreage not utilized for residential lots, roadway access and utilities shall be placed in common open space or devoted to recreation amenities. 
                  (1)  A minimum percent of the gross project site area shall be reserved for common open space, as follows: no less than 20 percent of the total site must be set aside as open space for conservation, preservation or passive recreational use, such as walking trails and picnicking. Valuable natural resources and required stream buffers are to be given preference for inclusion in the minimum required open space. Land devoted to stormwater detention facilities may not be counted toward the 20 percent minimum unless the facility is a permanent lake or pond and is designed and intended for recreational access and use by the occupants of the development. 
                  (2)  Additional common open space may be provided and may include active recreation areas for the proposed development, such as swimming pools, tennis courts, community facilities, etc. 
                  (3)  Required buffers on the perimeter of the property may be included in the minimum open space requirement. 
                  (4)  While common open space shall not be required to be contiguous, no individual portion of the open space that counts toward the 20 percent minimum shall be less than one acre in size, nor less that 50 feet wide in its narrowest dimension, except as follows: 
                  (a)  The open space area, by the very nature of its designated boundaries, is less than 50 feet in width. Examples include strips of steep slopes and "fingers" of floodplains that extend up drainage swales. 
                  (b)  Parkways between road travelways, which must be at least 26 feet in width to be counted as part of the minimum 20 percent common open space. 
                  (5)  No portion of the residential lots shall be credited toward the minimum open space requirement unless the portion is included within a conservation easement. No portion of any street right-of-way (other than a parkway between road travelways) or public or private utility easement shall be credited toward the minimum open space requirement. 
                  (6)  The required common open space shall be platted at the same time that adjacent residential lots are platted, in whole or in phases, in accordance with the phasing approved as part of the concept plan for the MPD. 
                  b.  Residential development standards. 
                  (1)  The subdivision may be served by a sanitary sewerage collection and treatment system approved by the county utilities and public works departments, or a community sanitary septic system approved by the health department. Public sewer must be approved by the county utilities and public works departments, and private sewer must be approved by the board of commissioners. 
                  (2)  Recreation amenity. In addition to the minimum required common open space, every subdivision must contain a community recreation amenity of adequate size or variety to serve the development, such as a community pool, picnic pavilion, tennis courts, children's playground or basketball courts, as deemed appropriate by the developer and approved as part of the MPD concept plan. 
                  (3)  Private open space required. Every single-family or two-family dwelling unit on a lot of less than 10,000 square feet shall have a minimum 400 square foot private yard or patio. Every townhouse unit shall have a minimum 200 square foot private yard or patio. 
                  (a)  The private yard or patio shall be arranged for use by the occupants of the dwelling and located in the side or rear yard. 
                  (b)  The private yard or patio must be enclosed by any combination of the following: a masonry wall, wood fence, trellis or lattice with a minimum height of six feet; or an evergreen hedge, shrubs or trees that will achieve a height of six feet within three years of planting under normal growing conditions. 
                  (4)  Lots within the development shall be serviced with underground utilities (electric power, natural gas, telephone, TV cable, etc.). 
                  (5)  The developer shall provide architectural renderings of proposed structures to be reviewed and approved by the board of commissioners as part of the concept plan or prior to each preliminary subdivision plat or preliminary site plan approval. 
                  (6)  All dwelling units shall have facades that consist primarily of brick, stucco or stone finish, with minimal painted wood lap or fiber cement board siding; or as otherwise approved as part of the MPD approval by the board of commissioners. 
                  (7)  Each single-family detached or duplex dwelling unit must include at least a 2-car garage, unless waived by the board of commissioners as part of the MPD approval. Wider streets with on-street parking may be considered on private streets in lieu of on-site parking. 
                  c.  Nonresidential development standards. Restrictions within through-road corridors apply to all commercial and institutional uses within a master planned development. 
                  (1)  Through-road corridor defined. Land lying along and within 200 feet of the right-of-way of a public street or highway that adjoins or traverses a MPD and that provides for movement of through traffic (in contrast to internal local streets) shall constitute a through-road corridor. 
                  (2)  Any commercial, office or institutional property or portion of a property within the MPD that is located within a through-road corridor shall comply with the following special design standards: 
                  (a)  Building setbacks. No principal or accessory building shall be located less than 50 feet from the right-of-way of a through road unless a reduced setback is approved by the board of commissioners as part of the MPD concept plan. This entire setback area shall be landscaped and may not include any parking or other accessory uses other than access driveways. 
                  (b)  Signage. Canopy signs are prohibited. 
                  (c)  Landscaping. Any property or portion of a property that is located within a through-road corridor shall provide at least 20 percent of its gross land area in landscaping. Landscape areas and treatments shall be identified on the site plan for the development, subject to approval by the county. 
                  (d)  Building materials. 
                  i.  The exterior walls of any building that is located within a through-road corridor and/or is visible from a through road corridor shall be of masonry and/or stucco-type-construction, or shall otherwise be consistent with and complementary to existing architecture in the general area. These finish building materials shall be applied to all sides of the building visible from the through road. Colors and materials shall be harmonious and compatible with colors of other buildings within and immediately adjacent to the district. Material colors shall be natural, muted earth tones, gray or muted red color brick, stone, and/or neutral shades of concrete. Bright or accent colors may be used with discretion where appropriate on ornamental locations on the building's exterior, but shall not be used as the primary building material color. 
                  ii.  No buildings with metal exterior facades will be permitted within the corridor nor shall any metal facade buildings be visible from the corridor. Metal roofs, including mansard roofs, are not considered part of a facade. 
                  Owner's association. 
                  a.  Homeowner's association; when required. For any residential development containing common open space or other lands in common ownership, a Homeowner's Association that provides for building and grounds maintenance and repair, insurance and working capital shall be required. 
                  (1)  Membership in the Homeowner's Association must be mandatory for each property in the development. 
                  (2)  Such associations must also include homeowner's declaration and bylaws, including covenants, conditions and regulations applicable to each property in the development. 
                  (3)  The declaration and bylaws shall be enforced by the Association or by an Association Management Company designated by them, which shall have the power to compel the payment of membership dues and assessments. 
                  (4)  The Homeowner's Association shall be formed under the provisions of Article 6 of Chapter 3 of Title 44 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, which is known as the "Georgia Property Owners' Association Act." (Code 1981, § 44-3-220, et seq. enacted by Ga. L. 1994, p. 1879, § 1) and shall contain adequate provisions to qualify it as a "holder" under the Georgia Uniform Conservation Easement Act, if it is to act as a holder of the conservation easement. 
                  (5)  The documents creating the Homeowner's Association must provide that an adequate reserve fund for the association will exist at the time that control of the association transfers from the developer to the purchasers of homes in the development. The reserve fund must be equal to no less than one year's expenses reasonably expected for the minimum operations legally required of the association. In lieu of a reserve fund, documents creating the Homeowner's Association may provide for a contract committing the developer to pay for all reasonable expenses of the association for the one-year period following transfer of control. 
                  (6)  The covenants, conditions and regulations shall, at a minimum, regulate and control the following:

                  (2)  The documents creating the Condominium Association must provide that an adequate reserve fund for the association will exist at the time that control of the association transfers from the developer to the purchasers of units in the development. The reserve fund must contain an amount equal to no less than one year of expenses reasonably expected for the minimum operations legally required of the association. 
                  Open space management. 
                  a.  No later than the time of concept plan approval, as part of the draft covenants proposed for the MPD, the applicant shall submit a written management plan for the open space areas shown on the plan. The management plan shall include: 
                  (1)  Provisions for the use, restrictions of use, ownership, maintenance and perpetual preservation of the open space areas; 
                  (2)  Allocation of responsibility and establishing guidelines for the maintenance and operation of the open space and any facilities located thereon, including provisions for ongoing maintenance and for long-term capital improvements; 
                  (3)  Estimates of the costs and staffing requirements needed for maintenance and operation of, and insurance for, the open space and an outline of the means by which such funding will be obtained or provided. 
                  b.  The common open space required herein shall be permanently protected in perpetuity by a conservation casement conveyed to the Homeowner's Association, or other entity approved by Oconee County prior to the sale of the first lot in such subdivision. The conservation easement shall be created subject to the provisions of Article I of Chapter 10 of Title 44 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, which is known as the "Georgia Uniform Conservation Easement Act." (Code 1981, § 44-10-1, et seq. enacted by Ga. L. 1992, p. 2227, § 1). All such conservation easements shall provide for either enforcement rights or third party enforcement rights, as the case may be, vested in the Homeowner's Association and in Oconee County and shall provide that the conservation easement may not be terminated or otherwise modified without the consent of all entities having either a property right or enforcement right therein. 
                  c.  The common open space areas shall be owned and maintained in accordance with the following criteria provided that the record title to the property and the conservation easement shall be held by different entities: 
                  (1)  Record title may be held by:

                  (b)  Oconee County; or 
                  (c)  Other entity approved by Oconee County, qualified to be a holder under the Georgia Uniform Conservation Easement Act. 
                  (3)  Maintenance: 
                  (a)  Homeowners' association; or 
                  (b)  Other entity approved by Oconee County. 
                  Special platting and development requirements. 
                  a.  All commercial sections of an MPD project must be platted separately from the parent parcel no later than the time of the recording of the final plat of the first phase of the development. 
                  b.  On commercial sections of an MPD project, at least one establishment (building) must be built prior to recording of the final plat for the last phase of the development except in the case of single phase developments where the schedule shall be determined per the rezone documents. 
                  (Ord. of 9-4-2007, exh. A (add. A)) 
                  Sec. 507. - Planned unit developments (PUD). 
                  Sec. 507.01. - Purpose. 
                  The provisions contained in this article shall apply to all properties approved as planned unit developments prior to December 31, 2002. As of January 1, 2003, no applications will be accepted for approval of a new planned unit development. Applications may be accepted for modification of a planned unit development created prior to December 31, 2002, provided that no increase in land area shall be approved. Such modification shall comply with the PUD regulations in effect on December 3, 2002. 
                  Sec. 507.02. - Criteria for development. 
                  a.  The purpose of planned unit developments is to encourage the best possible site plans and building arrangements under a unified plan of development rather than under lot-by-lot regulation. The developer benefits from better land utilization, economy in the provision of roads and utilities and flexibility in design. The county gains the advantages of variety in building types, compatibility of uses and optimum community development. Review of the development plan by the Oconee County Planning Commission provides an opportunity to assure that the development will be in harmony with the character of the neighborhood in which the development is located. 
                  b.  The planned residential development is not intended to encourage greater density of development, but rather to encourage ingenuity and resourcefulness in land planning and to assure the provision of park and recreation facilities for the use of the occupants of the development. 
                  Sec. 507.03. - Types of planned unit developments. 
                  The following types of planned unit developments are authorized by these regulations. They are required to have the minimum acreage indicated. 
                  a.  Planned residential development with shopping facilities: 100 acres. Planned residential development without shopping facilities: 20 acres. 
                  b.  Planned shopping centers: five acres. 
                  c.  Planned industrial parks: ten acres. 
                  d.  Planned institutional developments: 15 acres.

                  h.  [ Exception. ] Nursing homes and hospitals with full-time comprehensive medical staff shall not be considered as residential units for calculation of gross density. Instead, such facilities shall be governed by the maximum height restrictions, off-street parking and loading requirements, buffer and green space requirements and any applicable yard requirements for the permitted use. The land area necessary for these requirements shall then be subtracted from the gross land area within the PID prior to calculating the gross residential density.

                  Sec. 605. - Shared parking. 
                  The parking spaces provided for separate uses may be combined in one parking lot, but the required spaces assigned to each use may not be assigned to another use, except as follows. 
                  Sec. 605.01. - Shared parking between day and night users. 
                  One-half of the off-street parking spaces required by a use whose peak attendance will be at night may be shared with a use that will be closed at night or on Sunday. 
                  Sec. 605.02. - Mixed use developments. 
                  Parking spaces may be shared by more than one use if the director of planning finds that the total number of spaces will be adequate at the peak hours of the uses they serve. The ratios on table 6.3 may be used in determining the time of day and the day of the week at which the maximum number of spaces will be needed by the uses served by the shared parking facility. 

                   
                  By way of example, the following illustrates shared parking calculations for a particular mixed-use development: 
                  Example: 
                  Spaces needed for uses in a mixed-use project, calculated individually: 

                   
                  Spaces Required applying the Peak Demand Percentages to the Example: 

                   
                  Highest demand = 978 (instead of 1,340) 
                  Sec. 605.03. - Availability of shared spaces. 
                  Parking spaces that are proposed to be shared among two or more uses must be clearly available to each use and not appear in any way to be serving a particular use, either through signage dedicating the spaces or through design techniques that would tend to orient use of the spaces to a particular business or building. 
                  Sec. 605.04. - Recordation of shared parking agreement. 
                  Shared parking arrangements must be committed to writing in an instrument acceptable to the planning director, and approved by the owners of each of the affected properties or uses. The instrument must be approved by the planning director and shall be recorded with the clerk of the superior court, and a copy of the recorded document must be supplied to the planning director. The document must be written to survive future changes in ownership in perpetuity, unless the agreement is dissolved with approval by the board of commissioners. 
                  Sec. 606. - Proximity of off-street parking spaces to use. 
                  Sec. 606.01. - Location of parking spaces. 
                  All parking spaces required to meet the minimum standards of this article shall be located in proximity to the use that the spaces serve, as shown on table 6.4. 

                   
                  Sec. 606.02. - Off-site parking. 
                  If the required automobile off-street parking cannot be reasonably provided on the same lot with the principal use or building, such required spaces may be provided on other property subject to the following: 
                  a.  The parking spaces must be located on a property that has the same zoning classification as the property that the spaces serve, or a less restrictive zoning classification. 
                  b.  No required parking spaces may be located across any arterial or major collector road from the use they are intended to serve. 
                  c.  An executed easement (or other recordable instrument satisfactory to the code enforcement director) dedicating the off-site parking to the property that the spaces serve shall be submitted with the application for a building permit and shall be recorded with the clerk of the superior court prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy. A copy of the recorded easement shall be provided to the code enforcement director. The document must be written to survive future changes in ownership in perpetuity, unless the agreement is dissolved with approval by the board of commissioners. 
                  d.  Off-site parking spaces shall be located in proximity to the use that the spaces serve, in accordance with the locational requirements of table 6.4, or transportation services acceptable to the code enforcement director shall be provided that adequately serve the peak hour ridership demand of the use that the spaces serve. 
                  Sec. 607. - Design requirements for parking lots and driveways. 
                  The following specifications set forth the required plan and design standards for off-street parking in Oconee County.

                  (1)  No automobile parking spaces shall be accessible directly from an access driveway within the first 30 feet of the driveway back from the street right-of-way line of an arterial or major collector street. 
                  (2)  All off-street automobile parking spaces and drives (except those on single-family dwelling lots), shall be so arranged that vehicles can easily turn around on the space and/or drives and not have to back into the street upon leaving. 
                  c.  Location of automobile parking lots. Automobile parking areas are encouraged to be located in the side and rear yards of buildings. Required front yard setbacks may be waived or modified as a special exception variance if required parking areas are located in the side or rear yard area. See the appeals article of this Code for procedures. 
                  Sec. 607.02. - Off-street truck parking areas. 
                  a.  Parking areas for trucks and tractor-trailers should be located only to the rear or non-street side of the buildings and not adjacent to any interstate highway, arterial, or major collector road. However, if there is no other location available, the planning director may allow an alternate location and may impose special requirements based on the unique characteristics of the site. 
                  b.  All truck parking areas shall be effectively screened from any adjacent property and all streets or highways. The location and detail of all landscape buffers and screening shall be depicted on the required landscaping/tree protection plan. See the landscaping and buffers article of this Development Code for details. 
                  Sec. 607.03. - Parking lot aisles and access driveways. 
                  a.  Interior parking lot aisles when used with 90-degree-angle parking shall be not less than 24 feet wide; when used with 60 degree-angle parking, not less than 12 feet wide with one-way traffic; when used with parallel parking or where no parking exists, not less than ten feet for one-way traffic and not less than 20 feet for two-way traffic. 
                  b.  Interior driveways that are not associated with designated automobile parking spaces shall be not less than 20 feet wide for two-way traffic, and 12 feet wide for one-way traffic, measured from edge-of-pavement to edge-of-pavement, plus curbs and gutters.

                  c.  The required setback area between the front property line and the parking area shall be used for landscaping as required in the landscaping and buffers article of this Code. 
                  Sec. 607.05. - Lighting of parking areas. 
                  If the off-street parking facilities are to be used at night, they shall be properly illuminated for the safety of pedestrians and vehicles and for policing. 
                  a.  Illumination devices such as, but not limited to, flood or spot lights shall be so placed and so shielded as to prevent the rays or illumination therefrom being cast into neighboring dwellings and approaching vehicles. 
                  b.  A lighting plan and details shall be submitted to the planning director showing light templates (lighting footprints) for the proposed fixtures for review and verification of compliance with this provision. 
                  c.  Any lights used to illuminate a parking area shall be arranged, located or screened to direct light away from any adjoining residential use and shall not cause glare on any abutting property or street. "Shoe box" recessed lighting fixtures or similar non-spill lighting devices shall be utilized for this purpose. 
                  d.  Lighting fixtures on the underside of a canopy shall be installed in such a manner that the lighting fixture is recessed or flush with the canopy surface and the source of the light is not directly visible from any abutting street or residential use. 
                  e.  Parking areas shall not be illuminated between the hours of 12:00 midnight and 6:00 a.m. if the uses on the property are not open for business and employees are not on the premises, although temporary activation by motion detectors may be allowed to provide security lighting for periods not to exceed 15 minutes. 
                  Sec. 607.06. - Waiver from off-street parking requirements for intermittent, occasional or temporary uses. 
                  In the A-1 agricultural district, a special exception variance may be granted from certain requirements of this article for buildings or uses which are only subject to incidental, occasional or temporary parking needs, such as cemeteries, recreation facilities, or other buildings and uses where parking is not required on a regular or daily basis. See the appeals article of this Code for procedures. 
                  a.  Said variance may: 
                  (1)  Allow substitution of gravel or similar hard surface material in lieu of asphalt or concrete; and 
                  (2)  Waive the requirement for striping on the interior of the lot; and

                  (5)  Prior to issuance of a special exception variance under this exemption, the applicant for building permit, subdivision plat or zoning amendment shall first submit for planning department approval, the appropriate site development plan(s) required by this Development Code. Said plan shall show the proposed layout, dimensions, grading, and access for the parking area for which exemption(s) are sought and shall indicate all requested exemptions and proposed improvements. 
                  Sec. 608. - Inter-parcel access. 
                  Inter-parcel access shall be required as follows. 
                  Sec. 608.01. - Internal access easements required. 
                  For any office or retail sales or services use, the property owner shall grant a "cross" or internal access easement as described in this subsection to each adjoining property that is zoned or used for an office or retail sales or services use. The purpose of the easement is to facilitate movement of customers from business to business without generating additional turning movements on the public street, thus increasing public safety. 
                  Sec. 608.02. - Access easement provisions. 
                  The internal access easement shall permit automobile access from the adjoining property to driveways and parking areas intended for employee, customer or visitor use on each property; but parking spaces may be restricted to use by each owner's employees, customers and visitors only. 
                  a.  Inter-parcel vehicle access shall be required between contiguous properties only when the parking areas are or will be in reasonable proximity to one another. 
                  b.  All internal access easements shall be no less than 28 feet in width and shall be improved to a minimum paved width of 24 feet in order to accommodate two-way vehicular traffic to and from the adjoining properties. 
                  c.  The granting of an internal access easement on a property shall be effective only upon the granting of a reciprocal easement by the adjoining property owner. 
                  d.  Upon the availability of access to driveways and parking areas of the adjoining lot, the pavement or other surfacing of each owner's driveways and parking areas shall be extended by each owner to the point of access on the property line. 
                  Sec. 608.03. - Relief. 
                  Where the proposed land use is such that adverse impact of the required easement on use of the property would outweigh the reduced impact on the public street provided by the reciprocal easements, the planning director may waive the requirement for the access easements, in whole or in part, as a special exception variance. 
                  Sec. 609. - Improvement of parking areas. 
                  Sec. 609.01. - Surfacing and curbing; permanent lots. 
                  a.  In the A-1 and AR zoning districts, all minimum required off-street parking areas and all access drives for single-family and two-family dwellings shall be improved with an asphalt surface, triple surface treatment (TST) or concrete surface at least eight feet wide. See also section 607.06 for exemptions in the A-1 district. 
                  b.  Except in the A-1 or AR zoning districts, all minimum required off-street parking areas and all access drives for single-family and two-family dwellings shall be improved with a concrete surface at least four inches thick and no less than eight feet wide. 
                  c.  All off-street parking areas and all access drives for uses other than single-family and two-family dwellings shall be improved with a permanent load-bearing surface consisting of one or more of the following: 
                  (1)  Pavement consisting of a minimum of a four-inch graded aggregate base overlaid with a two-inch type E or F asphalt surface. 
                  (2)  Pavement consisting of a minimum five-inch course of 3,500 psi concrete applied on a stabilized subgrade consisting of at least 150 pounds of stone per square yard mixed in four inches deep and compacted. 
                  (3)  Porous asphalt or concrete pavement installed to the manufacturer's specifications on a 95 percent compacted subbase. 
                  (4)  Pervious paving materials installed to the manufacturer's specifications on a 95 percent compacted subbase. 
                  d.  For any multi-family or nonresidential use, and for any parking lot operated as a principal use, curb and gutter meeting county specifications for public streets shall be installed around the periphery of every paved parking lot containing more than five spaces. The curb and gutter shall also extend along both sides of every access drive between the paved parking lot or loading area and the street or another parking lot or loading area, as applicable. 
                  Sec. 609.02. - Landscaping.

                  Temporary parking lots may be approved for clearly temporary purposes for up to two years. Such lots shall have paved driveway aprons from the street to the right-of-way line, but may have a rolled and compacted gravel surface and need not be landscaped. At the end of the two-year period, the temporary lot must be removed from the property or replaced with a permanent parking lot meeting the requirements of this section for surfacing, curbing and landscaping of permanent parking lots. 
                  Sec. 609.04. - Maintenance. 
                  Off-street parking areas shall be maintained in proper repair with a dust-free surface.

                  a.  Parking lot construction. Construction of a new parking lot or loading area, or expansion of an existing parking lot or loading area, requires issuance of a development permit in accordance with the procedures and permits article of this Development Code. 
                  b.  Drainage facilities. For any use that will require a parking area of five spaces or more, or a loading area, to be newly constructed, added to, or altered in such a way as to affect drainage either on or off the site, stormwater drainage plans, including grading plans, shall be submitted to and approved by the public works director, prior to the issuance of a development permit. 
                  Sec. 609.06. - Time limit. 
                  All required off-street parking areas shall be ready for use, including the surfacing and striping requirements of this article, before occupancy of the property (in the case of a new building or addition) or within 45 days after the issuance of a certificate of occupancy (in the case of a change of occupancy in an existing building). An extension of time may be granted by the code enforcement director due to adverse weather conditions if the base course has been installed. 
                  DIVISION II. - TRUCK LOADING 

                  Sec. 610. - Off-street truck loading; where required. 
                  Any business or industrial building, hospital, institution, or hotel, in any zoning district, shall provide adequate off-street facilities for the loading and unloading of business merchandise, supplies, goods or freight within or adjacent to the building as deemed appropriate by the owner or occupants of the property. Such loading facilities, if provided, shall not obstruct freedom of vehicular traffic or pedestrian movement on the public streets and sidewalks. 
                  Sec. 611. - Location of truck loading areas. 
                  In all zoning districts, the following provisions shall apply:

                  ARTICLE 7. - SIGN REGULATIONS 

                  Sec. 701. - Purpose and intent. 
                  Sec. 701.01. - Findings, purpose and intent. 
                  a.  Statement of legislative purpose. 
                  (1)  The board of commissioners recognizes that signs provide an important medium through which individuals, businesses, and government may convey a variety of messages; however, unregulated signs can become a threat to the public health and safety as a traffic hazard, as a detriment to property values, and as an aesthetic nuisance affecting the overall economic growth of the county. Numerous professional studies have been prepared which examine and establish the effect of signs on traffic safety, aesthetics and economic prosperity, including the following:

                  (2)  Based on a review of the cited materials and the studies referenced therein as well as other related studies, the board of commissioners find that unregulated signs: 
                  a.  Can be a safety hazard to drivers and pedestrians; 
                  b.  Can be a detriment to the public health; 
                  c.  Can hamper economic growth; 
                  d.  Can lower property values; 
                  e.  Can adversely impact public investments; 
                  f.  Can degrade the utility of public safety signs; and 
                  g.  Can adversely impact the aesthetic quality of the community and surrounding environment. 
                  b.  Findings of fact. The board of commissioners finds that: 
                  (1)  Signs are a proper use of private property, are a means of personal free expression and a necessary component of a commercial environment. As such, signs are entitled to the protection of the law; however, an improperly regulated sign environment imposes health and safety dangers to the public; 
                  (2)  The result of effective sign regulation will be to lessen hazardous conditions, confusion and visual clutter caused by the proliferation, improper placement, illumination and excessive height and size of signs which compete for the attention of pedestrians and vehicular traffic; 
                  (3)  Proper regulation of signs is an necessary prerequisite to an attractive, orderly and safely designed business environment; 
                  (4)  Through proper sign regulation, the aesthetic attractiveness and economic well-being of the county will be enhanced as a place to live, work and conduct business. 
                  (5)  Concerns about aesthetic and safety issues as balanced with concerns about freedom of expression or speech are reasonably promoted in the county by the provisions of this chapter. 
                  c.  Purpose and intent. The purpose and intent of these sign regulations are: 
                  (1)  To aid in the identification of businesses and other commercial establishments in the county for police, fire and other emergency responses, and to avoid confusion and delay in response to such emergencies; 
                  (2)  To protect the public health, morals and welfare from the display of obscene language, nudity and the advertisement of illegal activities as defined in state law. 
                  (3)  To promote the mental and physical health, safety and welfare of the public by providing for the orderly and harmonious display of signs within the community; 
                  (4)  To maintain and enhance the aesthetic environment by minimizing visual clutter, encouraging a positive visual environment, and avoiding the erection of displays which could produce deleterious and injurious effects to adjacent properties and to the natural beauty of the environment; 
                  (5)  To provide for the safety of the traveling public, both vehicular and pedestrian, by limiting distractions, hazards and obstructions; 
                  (6)  To maintain the county's ability to attract sources of economic development and growth and to aid in the identification of properties and enterprises for the convenience of the public; and 
                  (7)  To encourage the effective use of signs as a means for communication in the county allowing the maximum amount of expression or speech consistent with the compatibility of such expression or speech with other land uses and with the aesthetic and public health, safety and welfare concerns which the county is charged by law and the Georgia constitution to preserve and protect.

                  Sec. 706. - Measurement of sign area and height. 
                  Sec. 706.01. - Computation of sign area. 
                  In order to determine compliance with the maximum allowable sign areas permitted under this article, the following shall establish how sign areas are measured. The terms "sign area" and "sign face area" are interchangeable and have the same meaning for the purpose of regulating maximum sign sizes. 
                  a.  Sign face area. 
                  (1)  The area of a sign face shall be computed as the area within the smallest rectangle enclosing the limits of a sign face, or the combination of the areas of all such rectangles delimiting each sign module, together with any frame or material, texture, or color forming an integral part of the sign face or used to differentiate the sign face from the structure upon which it is placed. 

                  (2)  For signs that have no identifiable frame or border, the smallest rectangle that includes all of the sign's words, letters, figures, symbols, logos, fixtures, colors, or other design elements intended to convey the sign's message shall establish the area of the sign's face. 

                  (3)  For signs applied to a kiosk or other cylindrical sign structure, the area of the sign face shall be computed as the largest rectangular area achieved from any one view of the sign. Measurements shall be made as a flat plane rectangle projected on the sign. 
                  (4)  The computation of the area of a sign face shall not include the structure, supports, or uprights on which the sign face is placed or any portions of a sign structure that are not intended to contain any message or idea and are purely structural or decorative in nature, other than those portions contained within the rectangle that delimits the sign face or a sign module. 
                  (5)  Manual changeable copy signs. For any sign on which any of the words, letters, figures, symbols, logos, fixtures, colors, or other design elements are routinely changed or are intended to be changed from time to time, the sign face area shall include the entire area within which any words, letters, figures, symbols, logos, fixtures, colors, or other design elements may be placed, together with any frame or material, texture, or color forming an integral part of the sign face or used to differentiate the sign face from the structure upon which it is placed. 
                  b.  Sign structure area. 
                  (1)  The area of a sign structure shall be computed as the area within the smallest rectangle enclosing the limits of the surface of a sign whereon the sign face or sign modules may be placed, including all portions of a sign structure that provide a background for the sign face but are not intended to contain any message or idea and are purely structural or decorative in nature. 
                  (2)  For a kiosk or other cylindrical sign structure, the area of the sign structure shall be the largest measurement achieved from any view of the sign structure. Measurements shall be made as a flat plane rectangle projected on or bisecting the sign structure. 

                  (3)  For project entrance signs or other signs that are imposed, mounted or painted on a wall or other decorative structure, the sign structure area shall be computed as that portion of such wall or other decorative structure that is discernibly devoted to the support of the sign or, by its design or architectural treatment, intended to provide a background or frame for the sign. 

                  c.  Treatment of open spaces. Any open space contained within the limits of the rectangle delimiting the sign face, sign module, or sign structure shall be included in the computation of the area of such sign face, sign module, or sign structure. 
                  d.  Multi-faced signs. 
                  (1)  Double-faced signs. For double-faced signs, when the sign face surfaces are parallel (back-to-back), or where the smallest angle formed between the two faces is 60 degrees or less, the area of the sign shall be taken as the area on the largest side. For double-faced signs where the interior angle formed by the faces is more than 60 degrees, the area of the sign shall be the total area of all sides. 
                  (2)  Signs with three or more faces. For sign structures having only three faces and the interior angle formed between all of the faces is 60 degrees, the area of the sign shall be taken as the area on the largest side. For all other multi-faced signs with three or more sides, the area of the sign shall be the largest total of all faces that are joined by an interior angle of more than 60 degrees that can be viewed from any one direction. 
                  Sec. 706.02. - Measurement of sign height. 
                  The height of a sign shall be equal to the vertical distance from the average grade at the base of the sign, or from the crown of the roadway of the nearest street within 50 feet of any portion of the sign, to the highest point of any portion of the sign, whichever results in the greater sign height. Any earthen berms and elevated foundations supporting signs, sign posts or other sign supports shall be included in the height of the sign. 
                  Sec. 707. - Sign types permitted by land use category. 
                  The following table 7.1 and table 7.2 present the maximum number, size, height, and other restrictions relating to specific signage that are permitted by right in each land use category.

                  DIVISION III. - AQUIFER RECHARGE AREA PROTECTION 

                  Sec. 909. - Authority. 
                  The provisions of this division are adopted pursuant to the Rules for Environmental Planning Criteria of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, adopted by DNR under O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8. 
                  Sec. 910. - Findings and objectives. 
                  Sec. 910.01. - Findings of fact. 
                  In order to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within Oconee County, Georgia and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be insured. For this reason, it is necessary to protect the subsurface water resources that Oconee County, Georgia and surrounding communities rely on as sources of public water. 
                  a.  Groundwater resources are contained within aquifers, which are permeable, rock strata occupying vast subsurface regions. 
                  b.  These aquifers are replenished by infiltration of stormwater runoff in zones of the surface known as aquifer recharge areas. 
                  c.  Aquifers are susceptible to contamination when unrestricted development occurs within significant aquifer recharge areas. 
                  d.  It is, therefore, necessary to manage land use within aquifer recharge zones in order to ensure that pollution threats are minimized. 
                  Sec. 910.02. - Objectives. 
                  The objectives of this division are: 
                  a.  Protect groundwater by prohibiting land uses that generate dangerous pollutants in recharge areas; 
                  b.  Protect groundwater by limiting density of development; and 
                  c.  Protect groundwater by reducing adverse effects on groundwater from the development that occurs within the recharge area. 
                  Sec. 911. - Aquifer recharge area. 
                  Sec. 911.01. - Protected aquifer recharge areas; defined. 
                  The Georgia Department of Natural Resources and the Georgia Department of Community Affairs have determined that each local government with "significant groundwater recharge areas" (identified on the Ground-Water Pollution Susceptibility Map of Georgia—Hydrologic Atlas #20 ) must adopt an Aquifer Recharge Protection Ordinance under the requirements of House Bill 215, Georgia's 1989 Growth Strategies Legislation and the rules promulgated there under. 
                  Sec. 911.02. - Aquifer recharge area; established. 
                  An aquifer recharge area is hereby established which shall correspond to all lands within the jurisdiction of Oconee County, Georgia that are mapped as significant recharge areas by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources in Hydrologic Atlas 18, (1989 edition) and are indicated as "most significant groundwater recharge areas" on the Ground-Water Pollution Susceptibility Map of Georgia—Hydrologic Atlas #20. 
                  Sec. 912. - Determination of pollution susceptibility. 
                  Each recharge area shall be determined to have a pollution susceptibility of high, medium, or low based on the Ground-Water Pollution Susceptibility Map of Georgia—Hydrologic Atlas #20. Said map is hereby adopted and made a part of this Development Code. 
                  Sec. 913. - Aquifer protection standards. 
                  a.  Waste disposal. 
                  (1)  For all pollution susceptibility areas, new solid waste disposal facilities must have synthetic liners and leachate collection systems. 
                  (2)  No land disposal of hazardous waste shall be permitted within any significant aquifer recharge area. 
                  (3)  Any new facility that involves the treatment, storage or disposal of hazardous waste, if permitted by DNR and the zoning district, shall perform such operations on an impermeable surface having a spill and leak collection system. 
                  (4)  Any new facility that handles hazardous materials of the types listed in Section 312 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (excluding underground storage tanks) and in amounts of 10,000 pounds or more on any one day, shall perform their operations on impermeable surfaces having spill and leak collection systems as prescribed by DNR. 
                  b.  Agricultural waste impoundment. New agricultural waste impoundment sites shall be lined if they exceed 50 acre-feet[sic]. As a minimum, the liner shall be constructed of compacted clay having a thickness of one-foot and a vertical hydraulic conductivity of less than 5 x 10 7 cm/sec or other criteria established by the U.S. Soil Conservation Service. 
                  c.  Chemical or petroleum storage tanks. For all significant aquifer recharge areas, new above-ground chemical or petroleum storage tanks larger than 650 gallons must have secondary containment for 110 percent of tank volume or 110 percent of the largest tanks in a cluster of tanks. Such tanks used for agricultural purposes are exempt, provided they comply with all federal requirements. 
                  d.  New construction on septic tanks. Within all significant aquifer recharge areas, construction shall not proceed on a building, mobile home or manufactured home to be served by a septic tank or on-site sewage management system unless the Oconee County Health Department first approves the proposed septic system installation as meeting the requirements of Section M of the Georgia Department of Human Resources Manual for On-Site Sewage Management Systems relating to protection of groundwater recharge areas. Such state requirements are also found under the Rules of the Department of Natural Resources, Environmental Protection Division, chapter 391-3-16-.02. 
                  Sec. 914. - Permit and plan review requirements. 
                  Consideration of the effect of aquifer recharge areas on the issuance of permits, approval of rezoning requests and review of subdivision plans is found under the "other permits" division of the procedures and permits article of this Development Code. 
                  Sec. 915. - Assessment relief. 
                  Assessors and boards of assessors shall consider the requirements of these regulations in determining the fair market value of land. 
                  DIVISION IV. - WETLANDS PROTECTION 

                  Sec. 916. - Purpose of wetlands protection. 
                  a.  The purposes of this division are to promote wise use of wetlands and protect wetlands, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational, and aesthetic values. 
                  b.  Activities that may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practical as determined by a permitting process. 
                  c.  The objective of this division is to protect wetlands from alterations that will significantly affect or reduce their primary functions for water quality, floodplain and erosion control, ground water recharge, aesthetic nature, and wildlife areas and to comply with the requirements of state law related to wetland protection. 
                  Sec. 917. - Wetlands protection; findings of fact. 
                  The wetlands within Oconee County, Georgia are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife, and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; open space; and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well-being of many communities within the State of Georgia. 
                  a.  Nationally, a considerable number of these important natural resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution, and other acts. Piecemeal or cumulative losses will, over time, destroy additional wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare. 
                  b.  The Georgia Department of Natural Resources and the Georgia Department of Community Affairs have determined that each local government with classified wetlands located in its jurisdiction must adopt a wetlands protection ordinance under the requirements of House Bill 215, Georgia's 1989 Growth Strategies Legislation and the rules promulgated thereunder. 
                  c.  It is therefore necessary for Oconee County, Georgia to ensure maximum protection for wetlands by discouraging development activities in wetlands that may adversely affect wetlands. 
                  Sec. 918. - Wetlands protection; authority. 
                  The provisions of this division are adopted pursuant to the Rules for Environmental Planning Criteria of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, adopted by DNR under O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8. 
                  Sec. 919. - Protected wetlands; defined. 
                  Sec. 919.01. - Wetland protection area. 
                  This division shall apply to all wetlands within the wetland protection area as defined herein and located within the jurisdiction of Oconee County, Georgia. 
                  a.  The generalized wetland map, adopted as part of this ordinance, shows the general location of wetlands and of the wetland protection area and should be consulted by persons contemplating activities in or near wetlands before engaging in a regulated activity. 
                  b.  The generalized wetland map, together with all explanatory matter thereon and attached thereto, is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this ordinance. The generalized wetland map shall be on file in the office of the Oconee County Planning Department. 
                  Sec. 919.02. - Wetland protection area boundaries. 
                  The generalized wetland map is a general reference document and wetland boundaries indicated on the map are approximations. The purpose of the generalized wetland map is to alert developers/landowners if they are within proximity to a wetland, which means that there is a high likelihood of the presence of a jurisdictional wetland and a need for the developer/landowner to seek U.S. Army Corps of Engineers guidance as to whether a section 404 permit will be required prior to any activity. The generalized wetland map does not necessarily represent the exact boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the jurisdiction of Oconee County and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended, or by a certified wetlands delineator. Any local government action under this Development Code does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements. 
                  Sec. 920. - Local development permit requirements. 
                  a.  No regulated activity will be allowed within the wetland protection area without written permission from Oconee County or its designee in the form of a development permit. 
                  b.  Issuance of a development permit is contingent on full compliance with the terms of this division and other applicable regulations. 
                  c.  All activities that are not exempted in section 921 below or by other local development ordinances, shall be prohibited without prior issuance of a development permit. 
                  d.  If the area proposed for development is located within 50 feet of the wetland protection area boundary, as determined from the generalized wetland map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required. If the Corps determines that wetlands are present and that a section 404 permit or letter of permission is required, a local development permit will be issued only following issuance of the section 404 permit or letter of permission. 
                  Sec. 921. - Restrictions on land uses. 
                  Sec. 921.01. - Allowed land uses. 
                  The following uses shall be allowed as a right within the wetland protection area if otherwise permitted by the zoning district and to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law, and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining, or dredging except as provided herein: 
                  a.  Operations conducted during normal silvicultural activities, including minor dredge and fill associated with road construction, harvesting, and reforestation practices, provided they meet the performance standards and road construction best management practices required under section 404 of the Clean Water Act. 
                  b.  Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish, and other wildlife, provided they do not affect waters of Georgia or of the United States in such a way that would require an individual 404 permit. 
                  c.  Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding, and canoeing. 
                  d.  Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the Georgia Forestry Commission. 
                  e.  The cultivation of agricultural crops. Agricultural activities shall be subject to best management practices approved by the Georgia Department of Agriculture. 
                  f.  The pasturing of livestock; provided that riparian wetlands are protected, that soil profiles are not disturbed and that approved best management practices are followed. 
                  g.  Education, scientific research, and nature trails. 
                  Sec. 921.02. - Prohibited land uses. 
                  Within any protected wetlands area, the following are prohibited: 
                  a.  Receiving areas for toxic or hazardous waste or other contaminants; 
                  b.  Sanitary waste landfills; 
                  c.  Hazardous or toxic waste receiving, treatment or disposal facilities; and 
                  d.  Any other use not specifically exempted as noted above or properly approved by Oconee County and relevant state and federal agencies. 
                  Sec. 922. - Wetlands certification. 
                  A design professional or certified wetlands delineator shall indicate wetlands on plans required for a land disturbance permit application. The design professional that prepared the required plans accompanying the permit application shall add a statement to the grading plan sheet indicating whether or not wetlands are located on the property by checking the appropriate box on the wetlands certification. The wetlands certification shall read as shown under the specifications for grading plans in the procedures and permits article of this Code. 
                  Sec. 923. - Permits. 
                  Site plan and permit review procedures for a development permit affecting protected wetlands are found under the "other permits" division of the procedures and permits article of this Development Code. 
                  Sec. 924. - Assessment relief. 
                  Assessors and boards of assessors shall consider wetland regulations in determining the fair market value of land. Any owner of an undeveloped wetland who has dedicated an easement or entered into a conservation easement with the government or a nonprofit organization to permanently control some or all regulated activities in the wetland shall have that portion of land assessed consistent with those restrictions. Such landowner shall also be exempted from special assessment on the controlled wetland to defray the cost of capital improvements such as sanitary sewers, storm sewers, and water mains. 
                  DIVISION V. - NATURAL RESOURCE CONSERVATION AREAS 

                  Sec. 925. - Purposes of natural resource conservation. 
                  The purposes of this division, among others, are as follows: 
                  a.  To recognize the current development rights of property owners established through zoning; 
                  b.  To conserve open land, including those areas containing unique and sensitive natural features such as stream buffers, floodplains and wetlands, by setting them aside from development; 
                  c.  To support the continued viability of agricultural activities in the county, including crop production, dairying and managed forestry; 
                  d.  To reduce erosion and sedimentation by the retention of existing vegetation and encourage minimization of development on steep slopes; 
                  e.  To enhance water quality of streams and waterways, and to protect valuable groundwater resources; and 
                  f.  To provide notification to property owners of natural resources that must be protected on their property. 
                  Sec. 926. - Designation of conservation areas. 
                  Sec. 926.01. - Primary conservation areas. 
                  Primary conservation areas are defined as follows: 
                  a.  Floodways within the 100-year floodplain. These areas are designated on maps prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and must be confirmed as to their specific location on a preliminary plat or site development plan, whichever comes first. 
                  b.  Flood hazard areas. All areas within the 100-year floodplain but lying outside any floodway, wetland or other designated primary conservation area fall under this category. The boundaries of the 100-year floodplain are designated as the "flood hazard area" on maps prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and must be confirmed as to their specific location on a preliminary plat or site development plan. 
                  c.  Required stream buffers. Natural vegetative stream buffers along the banks of all perennial streams and other state waters, as required by this article (except for activities that are exempt from the soil erosion and sedimentation control provisions of article 11). 
                  d.  Wetlands. Protected wetlands are defined under section 918. 
                  e.  Wildlife habitats of threatened or endangered species. The following have been identified by the federal and/or the state governments as threatened or endangered species in Oconee County: 

                   
                  f.  Natural buffer areas around wetlands and habitats of endangered species. Additional lands in their natural state provided around designated wetlands and critical wildlife habitats as protective vegetated buffers are recognized as primary conservation areas. A naturally-vegetated wetland buffer must extend at least 25 feet from the wetland, and a natural buffer around a protected wildlife habitat must be at least 100 feet deep, except for a necessary road crossing, utility crossing or other reasonable encroachments approved by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the Georgia Environmental Protection Division and Oconee County Board of Commissioners. 
                  Sec. 926.02. - Secondary conservation areas. 
                  Secondary conservation areas are areas that are encouraged (but not required) to be protected in any major subdivision or site development. These include: 
                  a.  Soils with exposed bedrock or rock outcroppings greater than 40,000 sf. Areas with exposed bedrock or rock outcroppings must be identified through observation on each site. Areas comprising 40,000 contiguous square feet or less are not considered secondary conservation areas. 
                  b.  Mature timber stands or significant trees. Forests and timberlands that have developed mature stands of trees qualify for conservation consideration. Individual trees that are specimen trees or otherwise have significance through their size, age, species or historic value may be designated as a secondary conservation area to the extent of the tree's dripline. 
                  c.  Registered historic or archeological assets. Sites or areas registered with the state or the National Register of Historic Places qualify under this category since preservation is desirable but not mandated by law. Information regarding all such sites is available from the Georgia Office of Historic Preservation. 
                  d.  Village greens, parkways. These areas create neighborhood assets by providing open space and passive recreation close to the homes in a subdivision. A village green is an open space area surrounded by streets and/or building lots on at least three sides, and intended for common neighborhood use. A parkway is a narrow strip of open space surrounded by streets on all sides, intended as a landscaped element or passive recreation area for the neighborhood. 
                  e.  Passive recreational areas. Common areas solely designated and improved for passive recreational activities, such as picnicking, walking, relaxation and repose, may be treated as secondary conservation areas. Active recreation areas, including but not limited to golf courses, swimming pools, sports fields and courts, and community buildings and grounds are not considered conservation uses or conservation areas. 
                  f.  Flood fringe areas. All areas within the flood fringe area but lying outside any wetland or other designated primary conservation area fall under this category. The boundaries of the area are designated as the "flood fringe area" on maps prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and must be confirmed as to their specific location on a preliminary plat or site development plan. 
                  Sec. 927. - Allowed uses in natural resource conservation areas. 
                  The following requirements apply only to land set aside under conservation or natural resources easements in fulfillment of the provisions of this article.

                  Sec. 927.02. - Allowed uses. 
                  The following uses are allowed in natural resource conservation areas to the extent that they are compatible with the protection and preservation of areas required by law but not otherwise required to remain undisturbed, and provided they are allowed uses under the site's zoning classification: 
                  a.  Conservation of natural, archeological or historical resources. 
                  b.  Meadows, woodlands, wetlands, wildlife corridors, game preserves, or similar conservation-oriented areas. 
                  c.  Walking or bicycle trails. 
                  d.  Parks, community gardens, playing fields or recreation facilities primarily for the use of the subdivision residents and their guests. 
                  e.  Landscaped stormwater detention areas and community water and sewage disposal systems located on soils particularly suited to such uses. 
                  f.  Easements for drainage, access, and sewer or water lines, or other public purposes. 
                  g.  Underground utility rights-of-way. 
                  h.  Other conservation-oriented uses if approved by the board of commissioners. 
                  i.  Agricultural and horticultural uses, including raising crops, pasturelands and dairy operations, along with associated buildings (including residences) that are specifically needed to support an active, viable agricultural or horticultural operation. Specifically excluded are commercial livestock operations involving swine, poultry, mink, and other animals likely to produce highly offensive odors. 
                  j.  Pastureland for horses used solely for recreational purposes. Equestrian facility buildings and grounds shall be permitted but may not be located in any Primary Conservation Area. 
                  k.  Silviculture, in keeping with established standards for selective harvesting and sustained yield forestry, and best management practices endorsed by the Georgia Forestry Commission. 
                  l.  Neighborhood open space uses such as village greens, commons, picnic areas, community gardens, trails, and similar low-impact passive recreational uses specifically excluding motorized off-road vehicles, rifle ranges, golf courses, sports fields and courts, community recreation buildings and grounds, swimming pools, and other active recreation uses. 
                  m.  Stormwater detention facilities within a natural resources easement required under section 928.01, subject to all state and federal regulations having been met, as evidenced by appropriate written approvals or permits issued by such agencies, and subject to written approval and acceptance by the proposed holder of the natural resources easement. Such facilities are not allowed to be located within a conservation easement required under said section 928.01. 
                  n.  The establishment by the developer or its designees and/or successors in interest of a jurisdictional wetlands conservation credit mitigation bank, threatened or endangered species conservation credit mitigation bank, or other conservation credit mitigation bank approved by and established in accordance with the rules and regulations of the United States Army Corp of Engineers or other applicable state or federal governing entity. 
                  Sec. 927.03. - [Non-permitted uses of open space.] 
                  Non-permitted uses of open space include the following: 
                  a.  Roads and non-permeable paved surfaces except necessary road crossings or as approved otherwise by Oconee County; 
                  b.  Above-ground utility rights-of-way except necessary utility crossings or as approved otherwise by Oconee County; and 
                  c.  Other uses inconsistent with the purposes of this Development Code.

In the event the utility does not make payment or arrange to make payment to the county within 60 days after the receipt of said statement, the county shall certify the amount for collection to the county attorney. Nothing in this article shall be construed so as to deprive any utility, relocated from a location in which it owned a property interest, of compensation for such property interest. 
                  Sec. 1007.04. - Promulgation of regulations by County. 
                  a.  The State of Georgia, Department of Transportation—Utility Accommodation Policy and Standard, 1988 Edition, is hereby adopted as the rules and regulations of Oconee County with the following exceptions: 
                  (1)  Section 3.2 (a) Where to apply is deleted and adopted in lieu thereof is the following "Applications for utility encroachment permits shall be made at Watkinsville, Oconee County, Georgia at the Office of the county engineer." 
                  (2)  Section 3.2 (b) Authority to Approve is deleted and adopted in lieu thereof is the following "The county engineer shall have full authority to approve requests for utility encroachment permits." 
                  (3)  Section 3.9 (c) Notice to Other Utilities is deleted and adopted in lieu thereof is the following: Applicants shall comply with "Blasting or Excavations Near Underground Gas Pipe and Utility Facilities" chapter of Georgia Code Ann. (O.C.G.A. § 25-9-1 et seq.). 
                  (4)  Appendices A, B, and C are deleted. 
                  (5)  The rules and regulations adopted hereby are those used by the State of Georgia. Wherever in the course of using or interpreting such rules and regulations, reference is made to the State of Georgia, the department of transportation or other state department, officer or employee, same shall be interpreted to refer to the analogous county department, officer or employee, i.e., a reference to the State of Georgia shall be interpreted to mean Oconee County, a reference to the department of transportation shall be read to mean the county engineer or a reference to a state road shall be generally read to mean county road. 
                  Sec. 1008. - Streets. 
                  This Code requires that all streets, whether public streets or private streets (other than private access drives meeting the requirements of section 1012.07), be built to minimum standards of material and construction. Several materials and types of construction shall be used, as set forth herein. 
                  Sec. 1008.01. - Access. 
                  a.  A publicly approved paved street meeting the requirements of this article shall serve every development and every lot within a subdivision (see also section 1003.04 regarding paved road access to a subdivision or development project). Private streets must meet all public street standards unless modification is approved by the board of commissioners as part of a master plan for a PUD or a concept plan for an MPD pursuant to section 1003.12. 
                  b.  A building permit shall not be issued on any property that does not front on or have approved access to a publicly dedicated street or an approved private street, in accordance with the minimum lot frontage and access easement provisions of this Development Code. 
                  c.  When land is subdivided into larger parcels than ordinary building lots, such parcels shall be arranged and designed so as to allow for the opening of future streets and to provide access to those areas not presently served by streets. 
                  d.  No subdivision or development shall be designed in a way that would completely eliminate street access to adjoining parcels of land. 
                  e.  Reserve strips which control access to streets, alleys and public grounds shall be prohibited unless their control is placed in the hands of the county under ownership, dedication, or easement conditions approved by the county attorney and the public works director. 
                  f.  Subdivision streets that intersect an arterial or major collector road shall do so at intervals of not less than 500 feet, or as required by the Georgia Department of Transportation, whichever is greater. On all other roads, at least 250 feet must separate street intersections on the same side of the road, measured centerline to centerline. Compliance with sight distance requirements of this Development Code may require greater distances between street intersections. 
                  Sec. 1008.02. - Relation to present and future street system. 
                  The design and layout of all streets shall conform to the general highway map of Oconee County or portions or elements thereof for streets, highways, and pedestrian ways. In addition: 
                  a.  The street system in the proposed subdivision shall relate to the existing street system in the area adjoining the subdivision. Horizontal and vertical alignments and other design elements shall substantially conform to these regulations, AASHTO Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets, and Georgia DOT design standards. Where conflict among these standards exists, the county engineer shall determine which standard shall comply. 
                  b.  Design of streets where railroads, parkways, grade separations, or freeways are involved shall be subject to conditions imposed by the county engineer as may be required by the circumstances in each case. 
                  c.  Whenever a proposed subdivision or development project abuts a road which is included in the state system of primary highways, an access road extending the full length of the subdivision or development project along such highway and providing limited access thereto may be required at a distance suitable for the use of the land between such access road and highway. 
                  d.  Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed arterial street, the public works director shall require an access road as provided under section 1008.02c, or a single tier of through (double-frontage) lots as provided under section 1003.09e, or such other treatment as will provide protection for abutting properties, reduction in the number of intersections with the arterial street, and separation of local and through traffic. 
                  e.  Subdivisions shall be laid out so as to discourage through traffic on local streets. However, the provision for the extension and continuation of arterial and collector streets into and from adjoining areas is required. Each street or way which is the continuation of or approximately the continuation of an existing street or way shall be shown on the preliminary plat and final plat and shall be given the same name as such existing street or way. 
                  f.  Existing streets that adjoin a development or subdivision boundary shall be deemed a part of the development or subdivision. The proposed street system within a subdivision shall have the right-of-way of existing streets extended no less than the required minimum width. Subdivisions that adjoin only one side of an existing street shall dedicate one-half of the additional right-of-way needed to meet the minimum width requirement for the street as a project improvement. If any part of the subdivision includes both sides of an existing street, all of the required additional right-of-way shall be dedicated. 
                  g.  All right-of-way required for off-site improvements related directly to the subdivision or development project, such as acceleration or deceleration lanes, shall be acquired by the developer at no expense to Oconee County. 
                  h.  Where, in the opinion of the public works director, it is necessary to provide for interparcel access to adjoining property, proposed streets shall be extended by dedication of right-of-way to the boundary of such property and existing streets through the development. 
                  (1)  Where an existing street on the adjoining property terminates at the boundary of the development or subdivision, the street shall be extended into the development or subdivision. 
                  (2)  Where no street exists on the adjoining property, a temporary turnaround shall be provided at the boundary of the development or subdivision at an appropriate location. See section 1008.04f(3) for standards. 
                  Sec. 1008.03. - Street classifications. 
                  For the purposes of this Development Code all of the streets, roads and highways in Oconee County are classified as local streets, minor collector and major collector streets, and arterials. The classification of each street in Oconee County is maintained on maps or records in the public works department. 
                  a.  Designation. 
                  (1)  Streets shall be classified into a street hierarchy system as shown in section 1008.04a. Street design standards shall be based on road function and projected average daily traffic (ADT), calculated with trip generation rates published in the most recent edition of Trip Generation Manual by the Institute of Transportation Engineers. 
                  (2)  For residential lots, this will generally be equal to ten to 12 trips per day per single family lot and 16 to 18 trips per day per two family lot. 
                  (3)  Trip generation rates from other sources may be used if the applicant demonstrates that these better reflect local conditions at the sole discretion of Oconee County. Street classes and their corresponding ADT thresholds are found in section 1008.04a. 
                  (4)  Each street shall be classified and designed to that classification for its entire length. The applicant shall demonstrate that the distribution of traffic to the proposed street system shall not exceed the ADT thresholds for any of the proposed street classifications. 
                  b.  Private streets. 
                  (1)  If and when a development plan indicates the construction of streets and utilities on private property, the owner shall indicate planned means for the maintenance of such streets and utilities. 
                  (2)  The construction specifications for such streets shall be the same as for public streets or the equivalent equal as approved by the county engineer and access shall be provided over such streets to an existing public street having a right-of-way of not less than 60 feet. 
                  (3)  In addition, the owner shall state, through an agreement prepared or approved by the local government's attorney, that the local government and governing body shall be relieved of any responsibility for the maintenance of said improvements. 
                  (4)  Such agreements shall conform to the Georgia Condominium Act if applicable, and shall receive such approval prior to the final review by the county. 
                  c.  Traffic impact studies. To assure that the provisions of the required streets in new land developments help prevent and reduce traffic congestion and hazards and to ensure the health, safety, and welfare of the traveling public, the county may require the developer to provide traffic impact studies when the projected traffic from the development exceeds 500 ADT. 
                  (1)  The county will require a traffic impact study when the projected traffic from the development equals or exceeds 1,000 ADT combined for all entrances. 
                  (2)  The traffic projection shall be based on the developer's most intense use as allowed by the zoning on the property. 
                  (3)  The requirement and scope of the traffic impact study will be based on the nature of the development, existing background traffic volumes and patterns, and future development along the adjoining corridors. The intent of the impact study is to identify the impacts to capacity, level of service, and safety to existing corridors and the actions required to mitigate these impacts. 
                  (4)  The determination of the requirement for traffic impact studies shall be made by the county engineer with consideration to the above criteria. The design professional of record shall determine the scope of the impact study and obtain concurrence of the county engineer. 
                  (5)  The traffic impact study and proposed mitigation measures will be provided and considered as part of the approval process for the preliminary plat.

                  Sec. 1008.04. - Design standards for streets. 
                  a.  [Rights-of-way and pavement width.] Street rights-of-way and pavement width shall conform to the minimum street design standards as shown on table 10.1. 

                   
                  b.  Street grades. 
                  (1)  A street grade exceeding ten percent for minor collector streets and 12 percent for local streets will be approved only when conclusive evidence shows that a lesser grade is impractical and would not cause detrimental land disturbance, erosion and distraction of vegetative cover, or stormwater hydraulic complications. In any case, any deviation from these standards shall still be in compliance with current AASHTO standards as determined by the county engineer. 
                  (2)  All street grades shall be no less than one percent. 
                  (3)  Grades approaching intersections shall not exceed five percent for a distance of not less than 40 feet, measured from the nearest right-of-way line at the point of intersection unless otherwise approved by the county engineer. Slope lines shall be extended beyond the eight feet minimum to achieve the proper corner/intersection sight distance. 
                  c.  Curved streets. 
                  (1)  Under no circumstance is a curved street to be reverse super elevated. All streets (unless super elevated) shall have a one-quarter-inch per foot center crown above gutter elevation. Crown slopes shall be transitioned over a distance of 50 feet from any intersection, to provide a proper tie-in at the mainline edge of pavement. 
                  (2)  See section 1008.04a for geometric requirements. 
                  d.  Street intersections. 
                  (1)  As far as is practical, all proposed streets shall be continuous and made to connect with existing streets without offset. In all cases of offsets, centerline jogs of less than 125 feet shall not be permitted. 
                  (2)  All street intersections and junctions shall be at right angles, unless otherwise approved for good cause by the public works director, but in no case shall they be less than 80 degrees. 
                  (3)  In addition, at all street intersections and junctions, there shall be a minimum stopping sight and corner sight distance in accordance with AASHTO Policy on Geometric Design. The profile shall be flattened at intersections to provide an area of not over five percent grade extending at least 40 feet each way from the intersection. In no case shall the stopping sight or corner sight distance be less than indicated herein. 
                  (4)  Islands within roadways at intersections shall be subject to individual approval by the public works director. In no case shall anything extend more than three feet above the pavement within the right-of-way of the street. 
                  (5)  Curb lines at street intersections shall have a radius of curvature of not less than 30 feet. Where the angle of street intersection is less than 90 degrees, a longer radius may be required. 
                  (6)  Intersecting street right-of-way lines shall parallel the back of [the] curb of the roadway. 
                  e.  Minimum sight distance. 
                  (1)  In all zoning districts, no fence, wall, structure, shrubbery or other obstruction to vision between the heights of three feet and 15 feet, except utility poles, light or street sign standards or tree trunks, shall be permitted within 20 feet of the intersection of the right-of-way lines of streets, roads, highways or railroads. 
                  (2)  Lines of sight shall be provided along street roadways (i.e., "midblock") and at street intersections in accordance with this subsection. The sight line shall be clear along its entire minimum length and unimpaired by intervening changes in street grade, horizontal alignment or obstructions. Examples of obstructions are vegetation, ground cover, signs, existing topography, etc. 
                  (3)  Midblock visibility requirements. The following shall be met at any point along the entire length of a street in between intersections: 
                  (a)  Minimum vertical and horizontal midblock visibility requirements are shown on table 10.2. 
                  (b)  Midblock visibility distances shall be measured along the centerline of the roadway between two points four feet above pavement level. 

                   
                  (4)  Visibility requirements at street intersections. 
                  (a)  At an intersection where traffic is to be controlled by stop signs on the minor road, said minor road shall be designed to intersect the major road in accordance with the standards imposed by the Georgia DOT, where applicable; and where not applicable the minor road shall intersect at such location as will provide minimum sight distance in either direction along the major road as required in table 10.2. 
                  (b)  For the purpose of these intersection visibility requirements, land zoned A-1 or any one of the AR zoning districts shall be considered rural, and roads located therein shall be classified as rural. All other roads shall be classified as urban. 
                  (c)  Visibility distances at intersections shall be measured from a point on the centerline of the entering street 14.4 feet back from the nearest edge of the roadway in the abutting street, and extending in both directions along the abutting street. Minimum sight distances are to be measured from the driver's eyes, which are assumed to be 3.5 feet in height above the pavement surface, to an object two feet high on the pavement in the center of every on-coming travel lane. 
                  (5)  Exceptions. 
                  (a)  Where it is deemed by the public works director that the application of a minimum sight distance requirement would render a property undevelopable, the public works director may require the installation of appropriate warning signs and flashing lights, a traffic signal, or other hazard reducing approach. 
                  (b)  Any modification to the required sight distances stated herein made by the public works director for cause shall conform to the standards and requirements contained in AASHTO policy. 
                  f.  Dead-end streets (cul-de-sacs). 
                  (1)  Cul-de-sac or permanent dead-end streets shall be terminated by a turnaround. They shall be separated from the exterior boundary or topographic boundary of the subdivision by the depth of one lot or 80 feet, whichever is less. 
                  (2)  Cul-de-sac streets shall not exceed 1,000 feet in length unless otherwise approved by the public works director. They shall terminate in a circular right-of-way with a minimum diameter of 120 feet and a paved diameter of 94 feet. This shall be measured to the edge of pavement in un-curbed cul-de-sacs and to the back of curb in curb and gutter cul-de-sacs. 
                  (3)  A dead-end street other than a cul-de-sac shall not be allowed except as a temporary stage of construction of a street that will be extended in a later stage of construction. Such non-permanent dead end streets may exceed 1,000 feet in length, but shall terminate in a turnaround with a minimum right-of-way of 90 feet in diameter. Said turnaround shall be provided with provisions for adequate grading, drainage and six-inch thick gravel surface, and so indicated on the preliminary, final plat, and construction plans. 
                  g.  Alleys and service drives. 
                  (1)  Alleys in residential subdivisions shall not be permitted, unless the alleys are intended to provide rear-access to garages on each lot and have a minimum roadway width of 20 feet of pavement, exclusive of curbs and gutters. 
                  (2)  Alleys with a minimum width of 20 feet of pavement, exclusive of curbs and gutters, may be required by the planning director where necessary to provide access to the rear of two or more lots designated for multi-family, business, or industrial use. 
                  (3)  Dead end alleys are prohibited unless the dead-end alley is provided with a turn-around having a roadway radius of at least 40 feet, a "T-head" turn-around, or other solution acceptable to the public works director. 
                  h.  Half streets prohibited. Half streets along development boundaries are prohibited. Whenever a street is planned adjacent to the proposed development or subdivision tract boundary, the entire street right-of-way shall be platted within the proposed development or subdivision. 
                  i.  Split level streets. A street that is constructed so as to have lanes in each direction at a different vertical level within the same right-of-way shall provide a pavement width of at least 14 feet in each direction and a vegetated median between the lanes having a slope of not greater than four to one. Split level streets will be allowed when: 
                  (1)  Topographic conditions are such that alternatives to the typical street construction would be more desirable. 
                  (2)  The shape and size of the parcel could be more efficiently developed. 
                  In either case, approval must be obtained from the public works director for the specific design. 
                  (Ord. of 9-1-2009, exh. A) 
                  Sec. 1008.05. - Street improvements. 
                  a.  Construction standards. All materials, construction, and definitions shall conform to the current Georgia Department of Transportation "Standard Specifications for the Construction of Roads and Bridges," latest edition, and any amendments thereto, unless otherwise stated herein. 
                  b.  Curbs and gutters. 
                  (1)  Vertical or rollback six-inch concrete curbs and gutters with a minimum overall width of 24 inches shall be constructed on all residential, commercial and industrial streets not in the A-1, AR-5, AR-4, AR-3, AR-2 and AR-1 zoning classifications. In the A-1, AR-5, AR-4, AR-3, AR-2 and AR-1 zoning classifications, concrete curbs and gutters are required in subdivisions where more than one-half of the total number of lots are one acre or less, or where the average street frontage per lot is less than 100 feet, or where at least one-half of the total number of lots in such subdivision have widths of less than 100 feet. 
                  (2)  Concrete curbs and gutters are required in the cul-de-sac portion of a street to channel water to the stormwater conveyance structure. Stormwater conveyance structures may include, but are not limited to, culverts, storm drainage pipes, catch basins, drop inlets, junction boxes and headwalls, and shall be provided for the protection of public rights-of-way and private properties adjoining project sites and/or public rights-of-way. 
                  c.  New local residential streets (without curb and gutter). 
                  (1)  Grassed shoulders and waterways (ditches) are required. 
                  (a)  The aggregate road base shall be extended one foot beyond the edge of pavement, (pavement is 20 feet wide) and the shoulders and ditch sections shall be constructed in accordance with Oconee County's typical cross section for unpaved roadways. 
                  (b)  In no instance shall the shoulder be less than seven feet. Shoulders shall be graded to no more than one-half-inch per foot. 
                  (2)  Unsuitable topography. Certain tracts of land, because of topographic features or unfavorable or highly erodible soil conditions, should not be developed with grassed shoulders and waterways. 
                  (a)  When a developer proposes to develop without curb and gutter, data and information showing that conditions are suitable for establishing permanently stabilized grassed shoulders and waterways shall be presented, together with any provisions necessary to correct any unfavorable conditions. 
                  (b)  An unfavorable condition is generally defined when the velocity of the stormwater in the channel exceeds 3.0 feet per second or erosive soils are present. 
                  (c)  When the county does permit development using grassed shoulders and waterways, additional provisions may be required where slopes and soil conditions are unfavorable. 
                  (d)  These requirements may include hydro-seeding of shoulders and waterways with specific grass mixtures, grass, sod, planting and erosion mats, rip-rap, concrete ditches, ditch checks, grade stabilization structures where the finished grade exceeds five percent, etc., to insure permanent stabilization of the shoulders and waterways and to minimize erosion and future maintenance. 
                  d.  Shoulder requirements. The street right-of-way shall be graded at least eight feet, measured from the back of the curb (curb and gutter sections) or seven feet measured from the edge of the pavement (uncurbed sections) on both sides of the street to provide space for installation of utilities, to prevent the encroachment of driveways into the street surface, and to provide walkways off the paved vehicular surface, and provide proper sight distances in curved roadway sections. 
                  e.  Grassed medians. Vertical or rollback six-inch concrete curb and gutter shall be required for a grassed median on all streets. Such medians shall be designed to slope towards the outside curb of a street or contain an adequate drainage system within the median. 
                  f.  Backfill, finish grading and grassing. Shoulders shall be sloped and backfilled as necessary following paving and curb and gutter installation as required by the county engineer. All curbs and gutters shall be backfilled according to the designs in these regulations. All eroded areas shall be reconstructed to the original final grade. Re-grass shall be required for bare spots, areas of insufficient stand and reconstructed areas. 
                  g.  Sub-surface drainage systems. Sub-surface drainage installations may be required by the county engineer to provide a stable sub-surface and base for fills and base course construction over wet weather springs, soft spots, swamps and other unsuitable soils. The county engineer shall require the owner to have a soil analysis and drainage design performed by the design professional of record if such conditions are encountered. 
                  h.  Cuts, fills, and subgrade. Cuts, fills, and subgrades shall be subject to the approval of the county engineer. The county engineer may vary the required slope. The county engineer shall specify any improvements necessary to protect community assets and to reduce the potential undue deterioration of street improvements. The developer will be guided by the following general requirements: 
                  (1)  The maximums shall be at a ratio of three feet horizontal distance to one foot rise (3:1). No slope line shall extend closer than eight feet to back of curb or 15 feet to edge of pavement on uncurbed sections. Minimum slope shall be one-half-inch per running foot. 
                  (2)  All slopes shall be adequately planted with approved vegetation. A suitable mulch of straw, hay, etc., shall be used. 
                  (3)  The developer shall be responsible for any erosion that might occur until the expiration of the maintenance period. 
                  (4)  Compaction shall be 95 percent by standard proctor density test. Subgrade compaction will be field tested through the use of a "roll test," as specified herein. 
                  (5)  All organic and other unsuitable materials located within the proposed roadbed and two feet on either side of the back of curb or edge of pavement shall be removed prior to subgrade preparation. 
                  (6)  Backfill behind curbs shall be free of organic material (roots, trunks, etc.), stone, broken concrete, etc. Topsoil and other similar unsuitable soil types removed from the roadbed may be utilized for shoulder construction, but not for fill construction, beyond eight feet on either side of the back of curb or edge of pavement. The use of topsoil within eight feet of the back of curb or edge of pavement shall be limited to a maximum depth of six inches.

                  (4)  If paving will not be completed within two weeks after the base course is completed during the period March 1 to December 1, then, the base will need to be primed in accordance with GDOT Standards with the roadway being barricaded thereafter. The above will be required within 24 hours during the period of December 1 through March 1. 
                  (5)  One asphaltic concrete extraction test per type mix shall be taken per subdivision. Extraction test results shall be reported to the county immediately after results are obtained. 
                  (6)  Asphaltic concrete compaction test for each type mix shall be taken at an interval not exceeding one per 1,000 linear feet per one lane of roadway. All asphalt courses shall be compacted to no less than 95.5 percent of the target density. Compaction ranges of 95.4 percent to 93.4 percent will require a specific and separate three year maintenance bond in the amount of 20 percent of the paving costs for the street affected. Compaction less than 93.4 percent will be cause for rejection and rework of the street section affected. The maximum pavement mean air voids will not exceed 7.8 percent in any instance. Compaction testing shall be accomplished in accordance with the appropriate standardized protocols for the GDOT Sampling, Testing, and Inspection Manual. Compaction test results shall be reported to the county immediately after results are obtained.

Upon presentation and approval of such documentation by the county, roadway construction will be considered as complete for the purpose of final plat. 
                  e.  Base, asphalt and compaction testing. 
                  (1)  Depth testing. The county reserves the right to require depth checks on base materials and asphalt cores shall be taken at random locations at 500 foot intervals along each road at the discretion of the county engineer or road and bridge inspector. Any area found deficient shall be brought up to the required thickness prior to placing any additional layer of material. All asphalt core holes shall be filled with hot mix asphalt of similar grade prior to final acceptance. 
                  (2)  Additional testing requirements/coordination. All testing shall be scheduled with the road and bridge inspector, or his/her duly appointed representative no less than 24 hours in advance. Compaction testing shall not be performed until the surface/material is to the lines and grades shown on the plans. Once an embankment, subgrade, or base course has been certified then that material shall not be disturbed or additional testing will be required. All areas or sections of the subgrade and base course, which do not pass compaction testing, shall be corrected. Once the developer makes all necessary corrections, it shall be his/her responsibility to schedule any and all subsequent test. The road and bridge inspector may require that in addition to the compaction testing required, a roll test be performed in accordance with section 1008.05k. All certifications provided shall contain all test data and results to support certification. 
                  f.  Seasonal limits. No roadway construction material shall be deposited or shaped when the subgrade is frozen at any depth or thawing at any depth or during unfavorable weather conditions including rain of any intensity. Paving material installation shall be subject to temperature and weather conditions as contained in Georgia DOT construction standards. The time period from December 1 to March 1 will require special construction procedures unique to the individual sites and weather conditions. The contractor/developer shall consult with the public works department during a supplemental pre-construction conference prior to beginning or continuing any roadway construction work during this period. It shall be the responsibility of the developer to schedule this conference.

All streams or portions of streams within the watershed as designated by the Game and Fish Division of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources under the provisions of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-20 et seq. Streams designated as primary trout waters are defined as supporting a self-sustaining population of rainbow, brown or brook trout. Streams designated as secondary trout waters are those in which there is no evidence of natural trout reproduction, but are capable of supporting trout throughout the year. First order trout waters are streams into which no other streams flow except springs. 
                  Vegetative erosion and sedimentation control measures. Measures for the stabilization of erodible or sediment-producing areas by covering the soil with: 
                  1.  Permanent seeding, sprigging or planting, producing long-term vegetative cover; or 
                  2.  Temporary seeding, producing short-term vegetative cover; or 
                  3.  Sodding, covering areas with a turf of perennial sod-forming grass. 
                  Such measures can be found in the publication Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia . 
                  Watercourse. Any natural or artificial watercourse, stream, river, creek, channel, ditch, canal, conduit, culvert, drain, waterway, gully, ravine, or wash in which water flows either continuously or intermittently and which has a definite channel, bed and banks, and including any area adjacent thereto subject to inundation by reason of overflow or floodwater. 
                  Wetlands. Those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas.

                  Sec. 1106. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control. 
                  Editor's note— Exhibit A of an ordinance adopted June 1, 2010, changed the title of § 1106 from "Minimum requirements for erosion and sedimentation control" to "Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control." 
                  Sec. 1106.01. - General provisions. 
                  Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the ordinance and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this ordinance shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of this section. The application of measures shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this ordinance and the NPDES general permit. 
                  a.  Minimum requirements; best management practices. 
                  (1)  Best management practices, as set forth in subsection a. and subsection b. shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by Oconee County or to any other allegation of noncompliance with this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a development permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act. As used in this subsection, the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the applicable Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
                  (2)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by Oconee County or of any state general permit for construction activities issued by EPD pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout streams. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines issued by the EPD director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any development permit issued by Oconee County or of any state general permit issued by EPD pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)  The EPD director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board of natural resources, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land-disturbing activities occur. 
                  (5)  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated subsection b.(15) in this Code [section], in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
                  b.  Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution and sedimentation control; specific. The rules and regulations, ordinances adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. §§ 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit, and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, re-grading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion. 
                  (2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum. 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practical erosion potential. 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented. 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum. 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practical. 
                  (7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development. 
                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control measures shall be installed as soon as practical. 
                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping surface of fills. 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property. 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners. 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross-flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible and provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum. 
                  (14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout streams. 
                  (15)  Except as provided in subsection b. and the environmental protection article of this Code relating to stream buffers and conservation corridors, there is established a 25-foot stream buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action except where the EPD director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the EPD director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, or where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream: That under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the groundwater table year round; for which groundwater is not a source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of article 5, chapter 5 of title 12, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  (a)  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a stream buffer and a stream buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  (b)  The stream buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
                  i.  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
                  ii.  Stream crossings for sewer lines. 
                  (16)  There is established a 50-foot stream buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to article 2 of chapter 5 of title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  (a)  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a stream buffer and a stream buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  (b)  The stream buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
                  i.  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
                  ii.  Stream crossings for sewer lines. 
                  (17)  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this ordinance or the terms of the permit. 
                  c.  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. §§ 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsection a. and subsection b. of this Code. 
                  d.  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this ordinance or the terms of the permit.

                  a.  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the Oconee County Board of Commissioners without first obtaining a permit from the code enforcement department to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
                  b.  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the code enforcement department and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in section 1107.03 of this article. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans shall conform to the provisions of subsection 1106.01a. and subsection 1106.01b. of this article. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by three copies of the applicant's soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan or that such a visit was not required in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-10. 
                  c.  A fee, in the amount of $250.00 up to 50 lots, $350.00 from 51 up to 100 lots, $400.00 from 101 to 150 lots and $500.00 from 151 lots and up shall be charged for each acre or fraction thereof in the project area. 
                  d.  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5); provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  e.  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the soil and water district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. A soil and water district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of a soil and water district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the soil and water district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the soil and water district, and any variances from the stream buffer requirements of this Development Code and bonding, if required as per subsection g. have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the soil and water district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the soil and water district. 
                  f.  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this ordinance section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing of the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
                  g.  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this Development Code or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call, the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations.

                  Sec. 1130.01. - Findings of fact. 
                  a.  The flood hazard areas of the county are subject to periodic inundation that results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  b.  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed or otherwise protected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
                  Sec. 1130.02. - Statement of purpose. 
                  It is the purpose of this section to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  a.  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  b.  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities; 
                  c.  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage; 
                  d.  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and 
                  e.  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters. 
                  Sec. 1130.03. - Objectives. 
                  The objectives of this section are to: 
                  a.  Protect human life and health; 
                  b.  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines and bridges located in floodplains; 
                  c.  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; 
                  d.  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
                  e.  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
                  f.  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; and 
                  g.  Ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

The initiation of new construction or a substantial improvement, as follows: (1) For new construction: The date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start of construction means the first placement of permanent construction of a building, including a manufactured home, on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling, nor does it include the installation of streets or walkways; the excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main building. (Note: accessory structures are not exempt.) (2) For a substantial improvement: The date the building permit was issued provided the actual start of construction was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural parts of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.

Any combination of repairs, reconstruction, rehabilitation, alteration, or improvements to a building, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the building prior to the start of construction of the improvement. The market value of the building should be: (1) The appraised value of the building prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement; or (2) In the case of damage, the value of the building prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures that have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual amount of the actual repair work performed. For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include (1) those improvements of a building required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions, which have been pre-identified by the code enforcement official through enforcement of this Development Code and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project, or (2) any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure". 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions. Is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced.

                  (b)  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
                  (3)  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. See section 1135.01f. 
                  (4)  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
                  (a)  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions); or 
                  (b)  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "new construction," including the anchoring and elevation requirements of section 1135.01f.

                  d.  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity flood waters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  (1)  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
                  (2)  Only if subsection d(1) above is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this division.

                  Sec. 1135.03. - Building standards for streams without established base flood elevation and/or floodways (A zones). 
                  Located within the areas of special flood hazard, where streams exist but where no base flood data has been provided or otherwise obtained from any official source, or where base flood data has been provided without floodways, the following provisions apply: 
                  a.  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided or cannot be obtained from any official source, then the code enforcement director shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state or other source, whether public or private, in order to administer the provisions of this section. 
                  b.  If base flood elevation data or floodway data can be determined under subsection a of this section, the provisions of section 1135.01 and section 1135.02 shall apply. If such data are not available, then: 
                  (1)  No encroachments, including fill material or structures, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 20 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
                  (2)  New construction or substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with the standards for elevated buildings, above. 
                  Sec. 1135.04. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO zones). 
                  Located within areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate. The following provisions apply in these areas: 
                  a.  New construction and substantial improvements. All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map, in feet, above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with the standards for elevated buildings, above. A registered professional engineer shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
                  b.  Nonresidential buildings. All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures may be flood-proofed. The structures, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to the specified FIRM flood level plus one foot, above highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify in writing to the code enforcement director that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above. 
                  c.  Drainage paths. Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure. 
                  Sec. 1135.05. - Standards for subdivisions. 
                  a.  All subdivision and/or development proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage. 
                  b.  All subdivision and/or development proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage. 
                  c.  All subdivision and/or development proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
                  d.  For subdivisions and/or developments greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is less, base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision and all other proposed development, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions. Any changes or revisions to the flood data adopted herein and shown on the FIRM shall be submitted to FEMA for review as a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) or conditional letter of map amendment (CLOMA), whichever is applicable. Upon completion of the project, the developer is responsible for submitting the "as-built" data to FEMA in order to obtain the final LOMR.

                  b.  An application for a change to a condition of approval pertaining to the grant of a zoning change is considered another zoning change and shall be subject to all time lapse requirements of this section. 
                  c.  The board of commissioners may only consider property for a zoning change within the time lapse periods established under subsection a. of this section as follows: 
                  (1)  If the original application had been approved by the board of commissioners and a request for re-filing is authorized by the board;

                  a.  Zoning changes initiated by county. Before taking action resulting in a zoning decision, the Board of Commissioners of Oconee County shall provide for a hearing on the proposed action. At least 15 but not more than 45 days prior to the date of the hearing, the commissioners shall cause to be published within a newspaper of general circulation within Oconee County a notice of the hearing. The notice shall state the time, place, and purpose of the hearing.

                  Sec. 1210.02. - Change in conditions of conditional zoning approval. 
                  Any application that proposes a change in the conditions of approval or concept plan previously established by the board of commissioners through action on a zoning change shall be reviewed in light of the standards set forth for a rezoning or for a special use under section 1207, as appropriate. Any such proposed change to a condition of approval is considered a zoning change and is therefore subject to all procedures and provisions of this division regarding the approval of zoning changes. 
                  Sec. 1210.03. - All TB amendments to be conditional zoning amendments. 
                  All TB technology business district amendments to the official zoning map shall be conditional amendments. In addition to any other conditions that may be imposed by the board of commissioners pursuant to the provision for conditional zoning in this Development Code:

Additional information required for rezone submittal is provided in section 1206.02. 
                  c.  Due to the complexity, size and the inability to predict the specific businesses and uses that will be located within a TB development, the following information may be excluded from the concept plan submission requirements: 
                  (1)  Representative architectural sketches or renderings of typical proposed structures, signs, landscaping, screening, and/or fencing; provided that the covenants adequately address these issues.

                  (6)  In lieu of the above requirements it shall be required that a complete set of Covenants and development guidelines for the proposed development accompany the concept plan, thereby becoming legal and enforceable documents with regard to the zoning request. 
                  (7)  At the time of construction plan submittal for each individual lot within the development the Oconee County development review committee or other reviewing body appointed by the Oconee County Board of Commissioners, will review the specified construction plans for compliance with the approved concept plan, covenants, and development guidelines.

                  d.  If a request for withdrawal of an application is received at the planning commission's public hearing, or at any time following such public hearing but prior to or at the agenda meeting of the board of commissioners at which said application would be scheduled for public hearing, the request will be automatically approved and the application removed from further consideration. An application for the same zoning change on the property or any portion of the property may not be resubmitted for 90 days from the date of withdrawal. 
                  e.  Should any request for withdrawal be made after the agenda meeting of the board of commissioners but before the public hearing by the board, the application shall remain on the board of commissioners' public hearing agenda and the withdrawal request shall be considered for approval or denial, with or without restrictions on re-filing, by the board of commissioners.

                  c.  Motion to table. 
                  (1)  A motion to table an application for a zoning change is not debatable, and must be voted upon when the motion is made before proceeding with further discussion or action on the application. 
                  (2)  At a board of commissioners' meeting for which public notice for a public hearing on an application has been given, if the motion to table is made prior to opening the hearing on the application, the board's action shall be considered a deferral of the public hearing and comply with subsection a. of this section regarding public notice for such deferrals.

                  Sec. 1217. - Procedural requirements for PUDs (planned unit developments). 
                  New planned unit developments (PUDs) may no longer be approved under this Development Code. The following provisions address overall plan modifications for existing PUDs and the process for approval of plans and permits for completion of previously approved PUDs. 
                  Sec. 1217.01. - PUD plan; administration. 
                  a.  Development of a planned unit development generally is guided by the PUD plan that was approved as part of the overall approval of the PUD, as may have been amended since the initial approval. Subsequent development must substantially conform to the approved PUD plan. 
                  b.  For any PUD that does not have an overall PUD plan approved for the entire PUD, no further approvals for preliminary plats or site plans shall be granted until an overall PUD plan shall have been approved by the board of commissioners. Such PUD plan must meet all requirements for a "concept plan" under section 1206.05 of this article. 
                  Sec. 1217.02. - Site plans and subdivision plats. 
                  a.  Approvals of individual projects within a planned unit development are to follow the county's normal development approval process, based on preliminary site plans or preliminary subdivision plats as normally required under this division for project approval. Each preliminary site plan or preliminary subdivision plat is to be consistent with the approved PUD plan for the planned unit development. 
                  b.  Approval for construction of an individual project within a planned unit development is to follow the county's normal approval process for development construction approval set forth under division III of this article.

Prior to any land development activity or the issuance of a building permit, the concept plan shall have been approved by the board of commissioners, and subsequent development must substantially conform to the approved concept plan. 
                  (2)  The level of detail to be shown on a master planned development concept plan shall reflect the scale of the proposed project. For a mixed-use master planned development, the various areas by housing type and land use category are to be identified and the parameters of development identified for each area. A master planned development involving only one type of housing would present more detail regarding the layout of the development. 
                  (a)  The concept plan for a master planned development involving only one type of housing shall conform to the requirements for a "concept plan" under section 1206.05. 
                  (b)  The concept plan for a mixed-use master planned development must designate the type of development planned for each area. The concept plan shall illustrate the individual lot lines within each subdivision and the building outlines in each condominium, multi-family or nonresidential project, and must conform to the requirements for a "concept plan" under section 1206.05. 
                  b.  Modifications to the concept plan. Development of each portion of a master planned development must substantially conform to the concept plan approved by the board of commissioners. If any preliminary site plan or preliminary subdivision plat is proposed that does not substantially conform, the concept plan must first be modified before the preliminary site plan or preliminary subdivision plat can be approved. Modifications of the concept plan can only be approved by the board of commissioners, following the same procedure as the initial approval of the original concept plan under section 1206.05. 
                  c.  Concept plan updates required. The master planned development concept plan is to be updated as individual site plans are approved for construction or final subdivision plats are recorded. Updating is an administrative process for submission to the planning department, and is intended to provide a record of the master planned development as build-out progresses. No update will be allowed that does not substantially conform to the approved concept plan, or that has not been approved as a modification to the concept plan by the board of commissioners.

The issuance of such an annual license shall not be deemed to authorize, condone or make legal any activity there under if the same is deemed illegal or unlawful under the laws of the State of Georgia or the United States. No annual license for an adult entertainment establishment shall be issued by the county if the premises to be used also holds a license to sell alcoholic beverages or malt beverages and wine for consumption on the premises. Any premises licensed as an adult entertainment establishment shall not be eligible to apply at any time for a license to sell alcoholic beverages or malt beverages and wine for consumption on the premises. There shall be an annual regulatory fee for each adult entertainment establishment licensed within Oconee County in the amount of $750.00. The annual regulatory fee must be paid to the code enforcement director of Oconee County within ten days after the code enforcement director approves the initial application for an adult entertainment establishment license or a renewal thereof. In any event, no adult entertainment establishment license or renewal thereof shall be issued until the most recent annual regulatory fee has been paid. All licenses granted hereunder shall expire on December 31 of each year. Licensees who desire to renew their license shall file an application with the code enforcement director on the form provided for renewal of the license for the ensuing year. Applications for renewal must be filed before November 30 of each year. Any renewal application received after November 30 shall be assessed, in addition to said annual regulatory fee, a late charge of 20 percent. If a license renewal application is received after January 1, such application shall be treated as an initial application and the applicant shall be required to comply with all rules and regulations for the granting of licenses as if no previous license had been held. If a license application is received after January 1, investigative and administrative costs as hereinafter set forth in this Development Code will be assessed. All licenses granted hereunder shall be for the calendar year and the full annual regulatory fee must be paid for a license renewal application filed prior to July 1 of the license year. One-half of a full annual regulatory fee shall be paid for a license renewal application filed after July 1 of the license year. Any person renewing any license issued hereunder who shall pay the annual regulatory fee, or any portion thereof, after January 1, shall, in addition to said annual regulatory fee and late charges, pay simple interest on the delinquent balance at the annual rate then charged by the Internal Revenue Service of the United States on unpaid federal income taxes.

                  (1)  They have no comments; 
                  (2)  Plan review comments are forwarded; 
                  (3)  The information submitted is inadequate to determine consistency with regulations; or

                  c.  There are certain services which the board of commissioners would not find appropriate to fund for one area and not another, but which are nonetheless reasonable and appropriate governmental services; and 
                  d.  Some communities, subdivisions or other discrete areas desire such governmental services and may be willing to fund same, but lack an effective mechanism to do so; and 
                  e.  It is desirable for the creation and regulation of special tax districts for the construction, establishment, maintenance and operation of public utilities, roads and other governmental services within such districts located in the unincorporated area of Oconee County.
