PREFACE

        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE This Republication constitutes a complete republication of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Doraville, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1969 Code, as supplemented through July 9, 1969, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1969 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Numbering System 
The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-2 and the first section of Chapter 4 is 4-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 3-1 and 3-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 3-1.5. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as Chapter 12.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. 
Indices 
The indices have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this republication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the republication. With this system, the republication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the republication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this republication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the republication. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This republication was under the direct supervision of Eric Grant, Vice President, and Katrina Hansen, Supplement Editor, of the editorial staff of Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Murray Weed, City Attorney, and Ms. Rhonda Blackmon, City Clerk, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this republication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs. 

 
SUPPLEMENT HISTORY TABLE 
The table below allows users of this Code to quickly and accurately determine what ordinances have been considered for codification in each supplement. Ordinances that are of a general and permanent nature are codified in the Code Book and are considered "Includes." Ordinances that are not of a general and permanent nature are not codified in the Code Book and are considered "Omits." 
In addition, by adding to this table with each supplement, users of this Code of Ordinances will be able to gain a more complete picture of the Code's historical evolution.

                  ARTICLE VII. - CONTINUATION OF MEDICAL INSURANCE FOR CERTAIN EMPLOYEES 

                  Sec. 2-186. - Qualifications. 
                  (a)  Any employee of the City who has accumulated not less than ten (10) years of service as an employee of the City and who has reached the age of fifty-five (55) years and elects to retire, or has his employment with the City terminated, voluntarily or involuntarily, may at his sole option prior to termination of employment, elect to continue to have medical insurance coverage under the insurance plan now or hereafter in effect by the City until such employee or spouse reaches sixty-five (65) years of age or such employee becomes eligible for Medicare coverage, whichever event occurs first, and may name his spouse (and dependent children) as an additional named insured (or dependent child) provided such employee timely makes all premium payments for the costs of such coverage to the insurance carrier now or hereafter providing hospitalization insurance coverage. "Employee" shall be defined as any fulltime employee of the City and any person who is an elected or appointed member of the governing authority who is covered under the retirement plan of the City. 
                  (b)  If an employee dies after electing to continue coverage after retirement, such coverage may also be continued by the spouse of any employee who has elected to continue such coverage upon payment of the applicable premium and subject to the other provisions of this article. 
                  (Ord. No. 233, § I, 5-7-90) 
                  Sec. 2-187. - Obligation with respect to payment of premiums. 
                  (a)  Premiums for medical insurance are payable by the employee and shall be paid when due, and if such premiums cannot be paid directly to the insurance carrier and must be paid to the City, then failure to timely pay such premiums shall result in a termination of coverage and no right of reinstatement shall exist. 
                  (b)  Section 2-186 and this section are intended only to make available to an employee who terminates his relationship with the City the opportunity to continue medical insurance benefits at the employee's expense and are not to be construed as obligating the City to provide any insurance benefits for those employees. Continuation of coverage is subject to approval of the insurance carrier for the City at the time of termination. 
                  (Ord. No. 233, § II, 5-7-90) 
                  Sec. 2-188. - Execution of documents. 
                  The City and the employee shall execute such consents as may be deemed necessary or proper to permit the acquisition of medical insurance by any eligible employee who meets the requirements as set forth in this article. An employee shall execute any and all documentation which the City or its insurance carrier may deem necessary or proper.

                  (Ord. No. 233, § IV, 5-7-90) 
                  Sec. 2-190. - Continuation of medical insurance for certain retiring employees with thirty or more years employment. 
                  (a)  Any employee of the City with not less than thirty (30) years of employment at the time of retirement and who is at least sixty (60) years of age and who is covered under the pension plan of the City who retires prior to the age of sixty-five (65) years shall be eligible to have medical insurance benefits comparable to those in effect at the date of retirement continued under the applicable insurance policies of the City, with the City paying for that portion of the coverage related to the employee only. The employee shall pay such portion of the premium for coverage for his spouse if such additional coverage is desired. If an eligible employee dies after retirement and prior to the age of sixty-five (65) years, such coverage may be continued by the spouse of such deceased employee upon payment of the applicable premium and subject to the other provisions of this article. 
                  (b)  This section shall only apply to those employees of the City who have accumulated not less than thirty (30) years of continuous employment with the City as of their retirement and who are employees with the City at the time of their retirement. Such benefits shall in no event be payable for more than a maximum period of five (5) years or until such retired employee becomes eligible for Medicare coverage, whichever event occurs first. 
                  (Ord. No. 233, § V, 5-7-90) 
                  Sec. 2-190A. - Continuation of medical benefits for permanently or partially disabled employees. 
                  Any full-time employee of the City who (a) has been a full-time employee for not less than twenty-five (25) years; and (b) is at least fifty-five (55) years of age at the time of termination from the City; and (c) is eligible to receive benefits under the City's retirement plan; and (d) has been certified by a duly licensed physician, licensed in the State of Georgia, to be permanently or partially disabled so as to be unable to perform the duties for which he or she was employed; and (e) has retired or has been terminated because of the disability, shall be eligible for continued medical insurance benefits, comparable to those then being provided by the City, with the City paying only the employee's portion of the premiums. Should the employee have a spouse or minor children, he or she may apply for coverage for the spouse and family if applicable, but all costs and premiums for this coverage shall be paid by the employee. If an eligible employee dies prior to reaching sixty-five (65) and while such insurance is in effect, such coverage may be continued by the surviving spouse for that spouse and for any minor children. Premiums for this coverage must be paid by or on behalf of the surviving spouse or children and the City shall have no liability therefor. 
                  Any coverage herein provided shall terminate when the employee receives either SSI benefits or insurance through any third party source, or until such employee reaches the age of sixty-five (65) years. If the employee acquires health insurance through self-employment or any subsequent employer other than the City, then the obligation of the City to pay for such employee's insurance shall terminate. If such insurance coverage is terminated it may not be reinstated. Insurance coverage which may be provided for herein is subject to the approval of the insurance carrier for the City. The City shall not be responsible for the payment of insurance premiums or the provision of insurance benefits if the coverage contemplated by this section is not available through or approved by the insurance carrier at the time.

                  Sec. 2-251. - Definitions. 
                  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  (a)  Declaration of domestic partnership means a form provided by the City Clerk's office in which two (2) people agree to be jointly responsible for the necessities of life incurred during the domestic partnership and that all qualifications for domestic partnership are met when the declaration is signed. The form will require both partners to provide reasonable proof of their primary, regular and permanent residence address. The form must be signed under penalty of perjury and must be witnessed and notarized. The City Clerk's office shall, within thirty (30) days of the effective date of this ordinance, make such forms available. To help defray costs associated with the providing and filing of these forms, the City Clerk's office is authorized to charge a fee as set forth herein for each completed form. 
                  (b)  Domestic partnership means two (2) adults who live together in the mutual interdependence of a single home and have signed a declaration of domestic partnership in which they attest that: 
                  (1)  They share the same primary, regular and permanent residence and have lived together for the previous twelve (12) months (documentation must be submitted verifying joint residency); 
                  (2)  They have a committed personal relationship with each other that is mutually interdependent and intended to be lifelong; 
                  (3)  They agree to be jointly obligated and responsible for the necessities of life for each other; 
                  (4)  They are not married to anyone or legally separated from anyone; 
                  (5)  They are eighteen (18) years of age or older; 
                  (6)  They are competent to enter into a contract; 
                  (7)  They are not related by blood closer than would bar marriage in the state; 
                  (8)  They are each other's sole domestic partner; 
                  (9)  They agree to file a termination of domestic partnership within thirty (30) days if any of the facts set out in this definition change; and 
                  (10)  Any prior domestic partnership in which their domestic partner participated with a third party was terminated not less than twelve (12) months prior to the date of such affidavit, and, if such earlier domestic partnership had been acknowledged under provisions of this section, that notice of termination of such earlier domestic partnership was provided to the City in writing to the business license division of the department of finance not less than twelve (12) months prior to the date of said affidavit. If the prior domestic partnership was terminated by the death of the partner, there shall be no waiting period. 
                  (c)  Live together means that two (2) people claiming domestic partnership status share the same primary, regular and permanent residence. It is not necessary that the legal right to possess the residence be in both names. Domestic partners do not cease to live together if one (1) leaves the shared residence for a period not to exceed one (1) year, but intends to return. Whether the relationship between these two (2) people is or is not sexual is in no way relevant for the purposes of determining eligibility under this article. 
                  (d)  Necessities of life means the cost of basic food, shelter, clothing and medical care. The individuals need not contribute equally or jointly to the cost of these expenses as long as they agree that both are responsible and obligated for the cost. 
                  (Ord. No. 06-21, § 1, 8-7-06; Ord. No. 2008-13, §§ 1, 2, 9-2-08; Ord. No. 2009-32, § 1, 11-16-09) 
                  Sec. 2-252. - Legal effect of declaration. 
                  (a)  Rights and duties created. 
                  (1)  Neither this article nor the filing of a declaration of domestic partnership shall create any legal rights or duties from one of the parties to the other, except those that specifically refer to domestic partnership. 
                  (2)  Nothing in this article shall be construed to explicitly or implicitly create a marital relationship. 
                  (3)  Nothing contained in this article shall create any rights in either domestic partner that are not covered, included or created in the underlying insurance or benefits plan documents of the City. 
                  (4)  This article does not attempt to alter or affect the laws in the state that regulate any private or civil relationships. 
                  (b)  Duration of rights and duties. Once a domestic partnership ends, the partners will incur no further obligations to each other under this article. 
                  (Ord. No. 06-21, § 1, 8-7-06; Ord. No. 2008-13, §§ 1, 2, 9-2-08; Ord. No. 2009-32, § 1, 11-16-09) 
                  Sec. 2-253. - Establishment. 
                  (a)  Generally. Domestic partners who are residents of the City or who are employees of the City may establish the existence of their domestic partnership by presenting an original declaration of domestic partnership to the City Clerk's office of the City along with reasonable proof of residence such as, but not limited to, a driver's license, utility bill, or state I.D. card. The City Clerk's office will file the declaration and provide the partners with a certificate showing that the declaration was filed with the City Clerk's office. The standard declaration form will be available in the business license office during normal business hours. 
                  (b)  Limitations. The City Clerk shall only accept for filing declarations of domestic partnership submitted by domestic partners who have residence in the City or who are employees of the City. 
                  (c)  Amendments to the declaration. A partner may amend a declaration of domestic partnership filed with the City Clerk's office at any time to show a change in such partner's primary residence address. 
                  (d)  New declarations of domestic partnership. No person who has created a domestic partnership may create another until twelve (12) months after a notice of termination has been signed and filed with the City Clerk's office; provided, however, that if the domestic partnership ended because of the death of the other party, a new declaration may be filed any time after the notice of termination has been filed. 
                  (e)  Evidence of domestic partnership. Any person who requires a person to provide evidence of the existence of a domestic partnership must accept the declaration of domestic partnership, but may choose not to require the declaration as complete proof of the existence of a domestic partnership. The declaration of domestic partnership may be considered reasonable proof for qualifying for any present or future domestic partner benefits that private corporations or public institutions offer. 
                  (Ord. No. 06-21, § 1, 8-7-06; Ord. No. 2008-13, §§ 1, 2, 9-2-08; Ord. No. 2009-32, § 1, 11-16-09) 
                  Sec. 2-254. - Records, copies, filing fees. 
                  (a)  Records of the City Clerk. The City Clerk shall keep a record of all declarations of domestic partnerships, amendments to declarations of domestic partnership, and all notices of termination. The records shall be maintained so that amendments and notices of termination shall be filed with the declaration of domestic partnership to which they pertain. 
                  (b)  Filing fees. The City Clerk's office shall charge a fee of thirty dollars ($30.00) for the filing of a declaration of domestic partnership and shall charge a fee of five dollars ($5.00) for providing certified copies of declarations, amendments or notices of termination. There will be no charge for the filing of amendments or notices of termination. 
                  (Ord. No. 06-21, § 1, 8-7-06; Ord. No. 2008-13, §§ 1, 2, 9-2-08; Ord. No. 2009-32, § 1, 11-16-09)

                  (a)  Sick leave, funeral leave, and annual leave benefits. An employee who has filed a declaration of domestic partnership with the City Clerk's office, and who has received a certificate of domestic partnership, shall be entitled to the City's sick leave, funeral leave, and annual leave benefits with regard to his or her domestic partner. 
                  (b)  Insurance benefits. An employee eligible to receive City health and dental insurance benefits, who has received a certificate of domestic partnership, shall be entitled to the extent allowed by the companies providing the coverage to obtain City health and dental insurance coverage for the employee's domestic partner. 
                  (Ord. No. 06-21, § 1, 8-7-06; Ord. No. 2008-13, §§ 1, 2, 9-2-08; Ord. No. 2009-32, § 1, 11-16-09) 
                  Sec. 2-256. - Termination. 
                  (a)  Termination. A domestic partnership ends when: 
                  (1)  One (1) partner sends the other partner written notice that such partner has ended the domestic partnership; 
                  (2)  One (1) of the partners dies; or 
                  (3)  The partners no longer meet one (1) or more of the qualifications or conditions for domestic partnership. 
                  (b)  Notice of termination. 
                  (1)  To domestic partners. When a domestic partnership ends, the partners must execute a notice of termination naming the partners and stating that the partnership has ended. The notice of termination must be dated and signed under penalty of perjury by at least one (1) of the partners. The notice of termination must be filed with the City Clerk's office. 
                  (2)  To third parties. A domestic partner who has given a copy of a declaration of domestic partnership to any third party in order to qualify for any benefit or right must, whenever the domestic partnership ends, give that third party a copy of the notice of termination. If a partner has died, the surviving partner must give notice of termination to those third parties such partner knows were given copies of the declaration by the deceased partner in order to qualify for a benefit or right. The notice of termination must be sent to the parties identified in this section within sixty (60) days of the termination of the domestic partnership. 
                  (3)  Failure to give notice. Failure to give notice as required by this article will neither prevent nor delay termination of the domestic partnership. 
                  (4)  Termination by City. Notwithstanding any of the above, the City shall terminate a domestic partnership if the City finds that the partners no longer meet one (1) or more of the qualifications or conditions for domestic partnership. The effective date of such termination will be retroactive to the date that such qualifications or conditions were no longer met. 
                  (Ord. No. 06-21, § 1, 8-7-06; Ord. No. 2008-13, §§ 1, 2, 9-2-08; Ord. No. 2009-32, § 1, 11-16-09) 
                  Sec. 2-257. - Enforcement.

                  (f)  At the time an application is submitted for an alcoholic beverage license or employee permit, the applicant shall, by a duly sworn or affirmed affidavit, certify that neither he nor any of the other owners of the establishment, nor the manager nor any agent of such establishment has been convicted or has pleaded guilty or entered a plea of nolo contendere to any of the offenses under the timelines provided in subsections (c) and (d). 
                  (g)  A license application or permit may be denied where it appears that the applicant would not have adequate participation in the proposed business to direct and manage its affairs, or where it appears that the applicant is intended to be a mere surrogate for a person or persons who would not otherwise qualify for a license for any reason whatsoever. 
                  (h)  The written application for the license shall be a permanent record which the licensee must maintain current as required by this chapter. The applicant shall have the duty to keep said application current until denied or abandoned. Failure to maintain a current application shall be grounds for revocation of the license or permit. 
                  (i)  No person shall have, own, or enjoy any ownership or interest in, share in the profits from, or otherwise participate in the business of any alcoholic beverage licensee in the City unless a full description of such interest shall have been furnished the City Clerk either in the application or at the time such interest may arise. It shall be the duty of the licensee to report to the Clerk, within five (5) days, any change in any interest in such licensee's business, including, but not limited to, any division of the profits, division of net or gross sales for any purpose whatsoever, change in the payment of rents or leases, change in the ownership of any lease or building or land used in such business, or change in the ownership of any corporation that has any interest in such business or the change of management of such corporation.

                  (1)  After receipt of such notice, the City Clerk shall notify such person within a reasonable time of any objection to the ownership interest set forth therein, and it shall then be incumbent upon such person to dispose of such interest within thirty (30) days after the mailing of the notice to do so by the City Clerk to such person at his address as shown on such notice of interest. In the event such interest is not disposed of within thirty (30) days after the mailing of the notice by the City Clerk, or in the event no objection is filed within such thirty-day period, or in the event such person fails to notify the City Clerk of the transfer of any such interest within twenty (20) days after the acquisition thereof, then the license, as provided for herein, may be suspended or revoked in accordance with the provisions of section 3-47 until disposition of the interest has been made or notice given to the City Clerk of the transfer. 
                  (2)  The report required by this section shall be in the form required by the City Clerk and shall be an amendment to the licensee's license application on file with the City Clerk and as such, shall be under oath or affirmation and verified as otherwise required by license applications. 
                  (j)  The license issued shall be valid only for the calendar year indicated thereon. A licensee that desires to continue business during the next or subsequent calendar year must make a renewal application for such year on or before December 31 of the preceding year. Payment of license fees for renewal of a license may be made at the time of application and upon approval of renewal by the City Clerk and payment, the license will be issued. Renewals are new applications. There shall be no protected property interest in any license. The City Clerk may use a modified application that allows reports of changes in renewals rather than a full application. Changes in measured distances shall be reported in accordance with section 3-17. 
                  (k)  All licenses issued pursuant to this chapter shall be valid only so long as the licensee is actively engaged in such business, with the exception of federally recognized holidays, vacations of the resident agent not exceeding thirty (30), and periods of repair, redecoration or remodeling, not exceeding sixty (60) days in a single calendar year where three (3) days written notice has been given in advance of such repair, redecoration, remodeling or vacation, is given to the City Clerk, the business shall be continuously opened as set out in this chapter, and in the event the licensee shall cease to be actively engaged in such business, such license shall be invalid and the licensee of such business shall immediately notify the City Clerk and return his license thereto. 
                  (l)  The City Clerk shall require a personal financial statement of any applicant for licensing purposes but not employment permitting.

                  the City Council finds: 
                  (1)  Nudity, partial nudity, conduct by bikini-clad persons, and/or sexual conduct coupled with alcohol in public places begets negative secondary effects, including sexual, lewd, lascivious, and salacious conduct among patrons and employees resulting in violation of laws and in dangers to the health, safety and welfare of the public; 
                  (2)  Physical contact between employees of alcoholic beverage establishments, including "bed" dances, "couch" dances, and "lap" dances as they are commonly called, are associated with and can lead to illicit sexual activities, including masturbation, lewdness, and prostitution, as well as other negative effects, including sexual assault; 
                  (3)  The City finds that the foregoing conduct, even when said employees are technically not nude or semi-nude as defined in other portions of Doraville City regulations, is substantially similar to and presents similar concerns as conduct by nude and semi-nude performers in sexually oriented businesses; 
                  (4)  Each of the negative effects targeted by this section constitutes a harm which the City has a substantial government interest in preventing and/or abating. This substantial government interest in preventing such negative effects, which is the City's rationale for this section, exists independent of any comparative analysis between the regulated establishments and other, non-regulated establishments. The City finds that the cases and secondary effects documentation relied on in this section are reasonably believed to be relevant to the City's interest in preventing illicit sexual behavior. 
                  The City hereby adopts and incorporates herein its stated findings and legislative record related to adverse secondary effects, including the judicial opinions and reports related to such secondary effects. 
                  (c)  On-premises conduct. No licensee, as defined in this chapter, shall knowingly violate the following regulations or knowingly or recklessly allow an employee or any other person to violate the following regulations: 
                  (1)  No person shall engage in masturbation, sexual intercourse, fellatio, cunnilingus, sodomy, bestiality, or flagellation on the licensed premises. 
                  (2)  No employee shall knowingly touch, engage in physical contact with, caress, or fondle the breast, buttocks, lap, pubic region, or genitals of a patron, whether directly or through clothing or other covering, on the licensed premises. 
                  (3)  No patron shall knowingly touch, engage in physical contact with, caress, or fondle the breast, buttocks, lap, pubic region, or genitals of an employee, whether directly or through clothing or other covering, on the licensed premises. 
                  (4)  No employee shall expose his or her genitals, pubic hair, buttocks, natal cleft, perineum, anus, vulva, or the female breast below a horizontal line across the top of the areola and extending across the width of the breast at that point (except that the exposure of the cleavage of the female breasts exhibited by a bikini, dress, blouse, shirt, leotard, or similar wearing apparel is not prohibited) to a patron on the licensed premises. This subsection (4) does not apply to conduct in theaters, concert halls, art centers, museums, or similar establishments that are primarily devoted to the arts or theatrical performances, when the performances that are presented are expressing matters of serious literary, artistic, scientific, or political value. The exception in the previous sentence shall not be construed to apply to any sexually oriented business as defined in the Doraville Code of Ordinances. 
                  (d)  [Employee.] Employee, for purposes of this section, means any person who regularly performs any service on the licensed premises on a full-time, part-time, or contract basis, regardless of whether the person is denominated an employee, independent contractor, lessee, or otherwise. Employee does not include a person exclusively on the premises for repair or maintenance of the premises or for the delivery of goods to the premises. 
                  (e)  Severability. Notwithstanding any other evidence of legislative intent, it is hereby declared to be the controlling legislative intent that if any provision of this section, or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held to be invalid, then the remaining provisions and the application of such provisions to any person or circumstances other than those to which it is held invalid, shall not be affected thereby, and it is hereby declared that the provisions would have been passed independently of such provision so known to be invalid. Should any procedural aspect of this chapter be invalidated, such invalidation shall not affect the enforceability of the substantive provisions of this section.

                  (1)  The violation of any provision of articles II, III, IV, V or VI as amended from time to time, by either the license holder or any person acting on his behalf, directly or indirectly, either as agent, servant, employee or otherwise; or 
                  (2)  The violation of any law, statute or regulation made pursuant to authority granted for the licensing of such businesses by either the license holder or any person acting on his behalf, directly or indirectly, either as agent, servant, employee or otherwise, which occurs in or upon the premises for which the license is granted; or 
                  (3)  The violation of any federal, state or local law or county or City ordinance (other than traffic ordinances) either by the license holder or any person acting on his behalf, directly or indirectly, either as agent, servant, employee or otherwise, which occurs in or upon the premises for which the license is granted; or 
                  (4)  The violation of any federal or state law equivalent, or the violation of any county or City ordinance (other than a non-serious traffic offense) by the license holder as set out in detail in section 3-14. 
                  (c)  It is the intent and purpose of the City that the license holder be responsible for and be held accountable for any activity which constitutes good cause hereunder, and any such license may be suspended or revoked if such activity occurred, regardless of the license holder's presence or knowledge thereof. 
                  (d)  Sales to minors. 
                  (1)  Intent. Is it the purpose of this section to administratively act upon a license where sales to minors have occurred at a licensed establishment. The administrative penalties set forth in this subsection (d) shall not prevent suspension or revocation of a license where other offenses occur in addition to sales to minors. 
                  (2)  Definition of event for administrative action. Where a violation of this section regarding minors originates from a single event that occurs in a 24-hour day, then such violation shall be deemed to be one (1) violation for administrative purposes. For example, if a server serves an alcoholic beverage to a minor and is allowed to do so by such server's manager, while two (2) criminal charges may be brought these events shall be deemed to be one (1) administrative violation so long as the offenses occurred within one, 24-hour day. If two (2) different servers serve two (2) different minors and the manager allows such service while four (4) criminal offenses may have occurred, the offenses shall be deemed one (1) offense for administrative purposes so long as the offenses occurred within one, 24-hour day. Regardless of the number of criminal offenses which occur in any 24-hour day, the same shall be deemed one (1) offense for administrative action. 
                  (3)  Administrative violation actions. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, if the license holder is solely in violation of the provisions of section 3-26, regulating sales to minors, the license shall be suspended or revoked as follows: 
                  a.  First violation within a 24-hour day in a 12-month period starting upon the date of the accusation of the offense—The license shall be suspended for a period up to fifteen (15) consecutive days. 
                  b.  Second violation in the same period as set out above in subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3)—Suspension for a period up to thirty (30) consecutive days. 
                  c.  Third violation in the same period as set out above in subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3)—Revocation for a 12-month period beginning upon the date of the Mayor and Council finding. 
                  (e)  Upon suspension of the license under subsection (d), the license holder shall place a sign on all entrances used by the public to access the premises and at each cash register stating the following: 
                  "This establishment's license to sell alcoholic beverages has been suspended for the period ____________ to ____________ ." (insert dates and times).

                  (d)  When a structure is meant for habitation, then a certificate of occupancy is required before the structure can be used. The certificate of completion does not grant authority to occupy a building or structure or change the type of occupancy or nature of use prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy when a certificate of occupancy is required. 
                  (e)  Structures which require certificates of completion include, but are not limited to: Garages, accessory buildings, guard shacks, fences, decks, planted common open spaces, landscape islands, street amenities, utility stations, stormwater drainage features and dumpster enclosures.

                  --- (5) --- 
                  Editor's note— Section 1 of Ord. No. 2009-12, adopted May 26, 2009, set out provisions designated as a new art. VIII. Inasmuch as article so numbered already exists, said provision has been redesignated as art. IX.  Subsequently, section 3 of Ord. No. 2011-36, adopted Sept. 6, 2011, changed the title of Art. IX from "Tree Protection Plan" to "Tree Protection Plan and Permit Requirements." 

                  Sec. 5-270. - General provisions. 
                  (a)  Purpose and intent. This article shall be known and may be cited as "The Tree Protection Plan" or the "Tree Protection Ordinance." 
                  Trees are recognized for their importance because they provide shading and cooling, improve stormwater quality, reduce noise, wind, stormwater runoff and soil erosion, provide for wildlife refuge, produce oxygen, filter dust, absorb carbon dioxide, and enhance the aesthetics and economics of all real property. Their contribution to the general well being and quality of life for the citizens of Doraville, as well as the region of metropolitan Atlanta is recognized and valued. Therefore, the City deems it necessary and desirable in the interest of public health, safety, and welfare to enact an ordinance for the conservation, planting and replacement of trees and to prevent the indiscriminate removal of trees and reduction of canopy cover within the City. 
                  The purposes of this article are to: 
                  (1)  Provide standards for the preservation of trees as part of the land development process; 
                  (2)  Protect trees during construction and land development whenever possible in order to enhance the quality of life within the City of Doraville; 
                  (3)  Protect specimen trees, as defined by this article, while providing for a reasonable use of each lot and avoiding regulatory takings; 
                  (4)  Promote a healthy urban forest; and 
                  (5)  Comply with needed requirements to gain recognition for the Tree City USA program. 
                  (b)  Definitions. For purposes of this article, the following definitions shall apply. All other words or phrases as appropriate to the context of their uses shall be interpreted as defined in Section 402 of the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Doraville (hereinafter "zoning ordinance") even though this article shall not be construed to be a zoning ordinance. 
                  Arborist shall mean the agent(s) of the City of Doraville primarily responsible for administering and enforcing the tree protection article under direction of the building inspector. Initially, the arborist shall be a contract professional rather than an employee of the City. 
                  Basal area shall mean the cross-sectional area of a tree trunk at diameter breast height (dbh) expressed herein in terms of "units" per acre. 
                  Bushes shall mean any plant with less than an eight-inch dbh. 
                  Caliper shall mean a forest standard of tree trunk measurement for understory trees or replacement trees. Caliper of the trunk shall be taken at six (6) inches above the ground for trees up to and including four-inch caliper size, and twelve (12) inches above the ground for trees larger than a four-inch caliper. 
                  Critical root zone (CRZ) shall mean the minimum area beneath a tree which must be left undisturbed in order to preserve a sufficient root mass to give a tree a reasonable chance of survival. The CRZ will typically be represented by a concentric circle centering on the tree's trunk with a radius equal in feet to one and one-half (1.5) times the number of inches of the trunk diameter. EXAMPLE: The CRZ radius of a twenty-inch diameter is thirty (30) feet. 
                  Density factor analysis shall mean a method of converting the size of any tree to tree density units for purposes of determining whether a given site meets the minimum tree density unit requirement prescribed by this article. 
                  Development activity shall mean any alteration of the natural environment which requires the approval of a development or site plan and issuance of a land disturbance permit. Development activity shall also include the "thinning" or removal of trees from any undeveloped land, including that carried out in conjunction with a forest management program, and the removal of trees incidental to the development of land or to the marketing of land for development. 
                  Diameter breast height (dbh) shall mean the standard of measure of tree size for those trees existing on a site that are at least four (4) inches in diameter at a height of four and one-half (4.5) feet above the ground. If a tree splits into multiple trunks below four and one-half (4.5) feet, then the trunk is measured at its most narrow point beneath the split. For understory tree and replacement tree measurement methods, the tree trunk shall be measured in accordance with the definition of caliper in this section. 
                  Drip line shall mean an imaginary perpendicular surface from a tree's branch tips down to the ground; the circular area of land surrounding the tree from the trunk to the outermost branches. This area is distinguished from, and not to be confused with critical root zone. 
                  Emergency shall mean any unplanned natural or manmade event resulting in damage to property which was in no way caused by the intentional or negligent acts of an owner or occupier of the property. 
                  Georgia Highway 141 Tree Protection Zone shall mean all property within a horizontal distance of one hundred twenty (120) feet of right-of-way of Georgia Highway 141. At major intersections on Georgia Highway 141 having exit and/or entrance ramps, the protection zone shall be reduced to sixty (60) feet. The reduction shall apply for the length of each ramp. The Georgia Highway 141 Tree Protection Zone is a buffer area. 
                  Hardwood tree shall mean any leaf-bearing (nonneedle-bearing) tree that is not coniferous (cone-bearing). This definition is based on the colloquialism, and does not necessary reflect any true qualities of the tree. 
                  Land disturbance permit shall mean any official authorization for construction, grading, grubbing, paving or clearing by the City of Doraville. 
                  Overstory tree shall mean a tree that composes the top layer or canopy of vegetation and will generally reach a mature height of greater than forty (40) feet. 
                  Revegetation shall mean the replacement of trees and landscape materials into the minimum required landscape areas as determined by the zoning ordinance generally, conditions of zoning approval, or the provisions of this article. 
                  Severe pruning shall mean the topping or pruning of any tree that removes more than one-third 1/3 of the canopy of the tree. 
                  Softwood tree shall mean any coniferous (cone bearing) tree, such as pine, fir, hemlock, cedar, etc. This definition is based on the colloquialism and does not necessarily reflect any true qualities of the tree. 
                  Specimen tree shall mean any tree, as defined by this article, in fair or better condition, which qualifies for special consideration for preservation due to size, species, or condition, and which meets the following: 
                  24″ dbh—Large hardwoods such as oaks, hickories, yellow poplars, sweet gums, etc. 
                  30″ dbh—Large softwoods such as pines, deodar cedars, etc. 
                  4″ dbh—Shall trees such as dogwoods, redbuds, sourwoods, etc. 
                  Provided, however, that a lesser-size tree can be considered by the arborist to be a designated specimen tree if it is a rare or unusual species, of exceptional or unique quality, or of historical significance. Provided further that a lesser-size tree can be considered by the arborist to be a specimen tree if it is specifically used by a builder, developer, or design professional as a focal point in a landscape project. 
                  Specimen tree stand shall mean any collective group of specimen trees, as defined by this article, which has been determined to be of high value in the opinion of the arborist, and which meets one (1) or more of the following: 
                  (1)  A relatively mature, even aged stand; or 
                  (2)  A stand with purity of species composition or of a rare or unusual nature or ecological value; or 
                  (3)  A stand of historical significance; or 
                  (4)  A stand with exceptional aesthetic quality. 
                  Tree shall mean any self-supporting wood, perennial plant usually having a single trunk, the cutting or pruning of which requires a permit when the plant has an eight-inch dbh. 
                  Tree bank shall mean an account, maintained by the Clerk's Office, of funds contributed from developers as a form of alternative compliance to the requirements of this article. Funds from the tree bank are to be used for the planting of trees on public property, tree removal or pruning on the right-of-way or in public parks, or other tree related projects within the City of Doraville. 
                  Tree board shall mean the Planning Commission appointed by the Mayor and Council to provide nonbinding advice and consultation on the City of Doraville's comprehensive tree management program and care of trees. 
                  Tree density unit shall mean a unit of measure based on diameter breast height of trees which is used to prescribe a minimum number of trees on any given development site. 
                  Tree in fair or better condition shall mean a tree with (a) a life expectancy of greater than fifteen (15) years; (b) a structurally sound trunk, not hollow and having no extensive decay, and less than twenty (20) percent radial trunk dieback; (c) for hardwoods only, no more than one (1) major and several minor dead limbs; and (d) no major insect or pathological problem. 
                  Tree removal permit shall mean a formal letter or permit issued by the City allowing for the removal of said tree(s) from a property. 
                  Tree save area shall mean an area designated for the purpose of meeting tree density requirements, saving natural trees, preserving the root system of natural trees and/or preserving natural buffers. 
                  Tree species selection list shall mean the recommended species of trees in Appendix B of this article. 
                  Understory tree shall mean any tree that grows beneath the overstory, and will generally reach a mature height of less than forty (40) feet. 
                  (c)  Doraville Tree Board. 
                  (1)  The Doraville Tree Board (hereinafter referred to as the "board") is hereby established to advise the Mayor and Council on matters pertaining to the conservation of trees and tree canopy cover on public and private lands within the City and to take instruction from the Mayor and Council regarding such issues. 
                  (2)  The board shall consist of the members of the Planning Commission who shall be appointed by the Mayor and Council. 
                  (3)  The board shall give nonbinding advice to the Mayor and Council on the ordinance, provide leadership in the development of understanding of the objectives and methods of the tree program, and assist the building inspector or his designee in the development and maintenance of technical specifications and guidelines. 
                  (4)  The board shall produce and maintain a list of proposed changes to the kinds and species of trees described in the Tree Planting List attached as Appendix B to this article. Any such changes may be adopted by ordinance of the Council and may be changed from time to time by ordinance. Upon such adoption, the changes shall become a part of this article. 
                  (5)  The board may enlist technical advisors in the fields of land development, landscape architecture and horticulture or related professions as needed and approved by the Mayor and Council.

                  (Ord. No. 2009-12, § 1, 5-26-09; Ord. No. 2010-29, §§ 1, 2, 10-18-10; Ord. No. 2011-36, § 2, 9-6-11) 
                  Sec. 5-271. - Tree protection. 
                  (a)  Tree survey required. 
                  (1)  Survey required. Unless specifically exempted from this article, before the commencement of any alteration, defoliation or land disturbing activity which requires the issuance of a land disturbance permit, a tree survey shall be completed and submitted to the arborist in accordance with the requirements of this article. When an application for a preliminary plat is made, the applicant shall be required to submit a tree survey. 
                  (2)  Survey requirements. The tree survey shall be in the form of a to-scale map or site plan prepared and sealed by a registered land surveyor, registered professional engineer, registered landscape architect, an arborist certified by the International Society of Arboriculture or a registered forester noting the location of all specimen trees plus all other trees which will be preserved and counted toward meeting site tree density unit requirements established by this article. Important natural features such as streams and wetlands shall also be shown on the tree survey. 
                  (3)  Specimen trees. All specimen trees and their critical root zones and drip lines shall be labeled, even if the tree trunk is not on the subject property, and must be shown on the tree survey and inventoried by size and species. This includes those specimen trees that are to be preserved as well as those proposed for removal, if any, and the portion of critical root zones and drip lines of trees on abutting properties which are contained within the subject property, to the extent that such drip lines and critical root zones can be determined from the vantage point of the property to be developed. This provision shall not authorize the trespass on other private property abutting the site. 
                  (4)  Other trees to be retained. All other trees that are to be counted toward meeting tree density unit requirements of this article must be shown on the survey and inventoried by size and species. Only trees with a caliper measurement of three (3) inches or greater are to be identified as eligible for tree density unit compliance purposes. 
                  (5)  Trees to be removed. Trees other than specimen trees that are proposed to be removed and which thus cannot be counted toward tree density unit requirements are not required to be counted and shown individually on the tree survey. Such trees shall be estimated in number, size and species of such trees and quantified as part of the total site inventory of tree population. 
                  (6)  Sampling. Sampling methods may be used to determine tree densities for forested areas over two (2) acres. 
                  (7)  Tree save areas. All tree save areas must be delineated on the tree survey. All buffers with existing trees must be delineated on the tree survey as tree save areas. Land disturbance within any buffer is subject to approval by the arborist. 
                  a.  List and tree density unit calculations. The tree survey shall provide an accurate list of those trees to be saved and a total value of tree density units for the entire property. 
                  b.  Tree survey inspection. Within fourteen (14) working days following the receipt of a tree survey, the arborist shall schedule and conduct an inspection of the proposed development site. The applicant or his designee shall be advised as to the date and time of the inspection and given the opportunity to attend and observe the inspection. Following inspection, the arborist, consistent with the purposes of this article, shall advise the applicant in writing or on the survey of any recommended changes to the applicant's tree survey. 
                  c.  Tree protection plan required. Unless specifically exempted from this article, before the commencement of any alteration, defoliation or land disturbing activity which requires the issuance of a land disturbance permit, a tree protection plan shall be completed and submitted to the arborist in accordance with the requirements of this article. The Georgia Highway 141 Tree Protection Zone shall be observed. 
                  d.  Tree protection plan specifications. The tree protection plan shall be a detailed plan designed to protect and preserve trees before, during and for a period of two (2) years after construction. Required specifications for a tree protection plan include the following: 
                  1.  Separate drawing. The tree protection plan shall be submitted as a separate drawing unless the arborist approves the combination of a tree protection plan with a tree replacement plan on a single drawing. 
                  2.  Boundary survey. The tree protection plan shall be submitted on a current boundary survey of the proposed site, drawn to scale, and showing clearly all information required in this section. 
                  3.  Trace identification. The plan shall identify the trace of land involved by acreage and location. 
                  4.  Owner and contact. The name, address and phone number of the owner of the land and the name, address and phone number of any tenant of the property, and a twenty-four-hour emergency contact phone number. 
                  5.  Trees to be protected. The type, location and size as measured at the diameter breast height of all tree(s) to be protected. Only trees designated on the approved tree protection plan will be counted toward meeting the minimum required tree density requirement. 
                  6.  Specimen trees. Locations, species, size, critical root zones, and drip lines of those specimen trees proposed to be protected and, if any, proposed to be removed. The tree protection plan must include any portion of a critical root zone or drip line of any trees on abutting properties proposed to be protected. Removal of specimen trees is subject to approval by the arborist in accordance with this article. 
                  7.  Tree save areas and clearing limits. All natural areas to be retained and buffers shall be included in the tree save area. There shall be no material storage in tree save areas. Limits of clearing and land disturbance such as grading, trenching, etc., where these disturbances may affect tree save areas shall also be shown, including an indication of staging areas for parking, material storage, concrete washout and other areas where tree protection may be affected. 
                  8.  Tree protection methods. Methods of tree protection shall be indicated for all tree save areas, including tree fencing, erosion control, retaining walls, tunneling for utilities, aeration systems, transplanting, staking, signage, geoweb or similar materials, permeable paving, bollards, etc. 
                  9.  Development characteristics. The locations of roads, existing and proposed structures, paving, driveways, cut and fill areas, drainage before and after construction including detention areas, etc. 
                  10.  Utilities and easements. The locations of all existing and proposed utility lines or easements, including the location for any boring sites for underground utilities. 
                  11.  Tree density units. Calculations showing the amount of existing trees to be retained for purposes of complying with the minimum required tree density units required by this article. Only existing trees with a dbh of two (2) inches or greater shall be counted toward meeting the minimum tree density unit requirements. 
                  12.  Irrigation systems. The tree protection plan must also indicate any irrigation systems required by this article. 
                  13.  Additional information. Additional information as required on a case-by-case basis by the arborist. 
                  e.  Arborist authority and action on a tree protection plan. Prior to approval of the tree protection plan, the arborist may require relocation or replacement of trees as uniformly as possible throughout the site. The arborist may require the use of active tree protection fencing for any or all tree save areas. Passive tree protection fencing is to be used only for areas remote from construction activity. 
                  f.  Standards for tree protection during construction. 
                  1.  Materials prohibited in tree save areas. No structure(s) improvement(s), or any activity including solvents, material, construction machinery, portable toilets, construction trailers, or temporary soil deposits shall encroach or be placed within the drip line and within six (6) feet of the area immediately outside the drip line, of any specimen tree or any tree within a tree save area unless authorized by the arborist in writing. 
                  2.  Tree protection devices. Before development, land clearing, filling, or any land alteration, the developer shall be required to erect suitable protective barriers as required by the arborist pursuant to an approved tree protection plan, including tree fences, tree protection signs, and erosion barriers. Inspection of tree protection barriers is required prior to the commencement of any land disturbance or development. Said tree protection measures shall remain in functioning condition until completion of site landscaping or completion of the project as authorized in writing by the arborist, or until the certificate of occupancy is issued. 
                  3.  Active tree protection devices. Materials for active tree protection shall consist of chain link, orange laminated plastic, wooden post and rail fencing or other equivalent restraining material. In addition to fencing where active tree protection is required, each tree to be saved shall be marked at the base of the trunk with blue-colored water-based paint. 
                  4.  Passive tree protection. Materials for passive tree protection shall consist of heavy mil. Plastic flagging, a minimum of four (4) inches wide with dark letters reading "Tree Protection Area—Do Not Enter" or equivalent signage on a continuous, durable restraint. 
                  5.  Additional measures. The developer shall take measures to ensure the health of the protected trees during construction, including but not limited to, the following measures: 
                  (i)  Water, fertilize and treat the trees for pests or disease as needed, in accordance with standards of the International Society of Arboriculture. 
                  (ii)  If grading covers the trees with dust, hose them off. 
                  (iii)  Do not randomly or incorrectly prune live branches so that equipment or structures can "fit" within the tree's protected zone. 
                  (iv)  Do not strip the topsoil or remove the natural leaf mulch or material from beneath a protected tree. 
                  (v)  Trees should be felled away from, rather than into, tree save areas. 
                  (vi)  Provide adequate mulching and water for trees that will be retained. 
                  g.  Tree damage. Any tree, designated on a tree protection plan to be saved, which is damaged during construction or as a result of construction, as determined by the arborist, shall be treated according to accepted standards of the National Arborists Association, or replaced with a tree or trees equal to the tree density unit value of the tree removed. However, any specimen tree damaged as described above shall be replaced with trees equal to two (2) times the unit value of the tree removed or damaged. If a damaged specimen tree must be removed, the area occupied by its drip line must remain in a pervious state. A replacement plan for such area must be approved by the arborist. 
                  h.  Pruning. 
                  1.  Pruning shall not cause long-term health or structural problems and must be done in accordance with International Society of Arboriculture Standards (ANSI A300). 
                  2.  "Topping" or severe pruning is prohibited. Severe pruning seriously affects a tree's food supply, can scald the newly exposed outer bar, make trees vulnerable to insect invasion, stimulate the regrowth of dense, upright branches below the pruning cut, make the tree more vulnerable to wind damage, disfigure the tree aesthetically, and sometimes result in the death of the tree. 
                  (Ord. No. 2009-12, § 1, 5-26-09) 
                  Sec. 5-272. - Tree removal. 
                  (a)  Removal of specimen trees. Unless specifically exempted from the requirements of this article, no specimen tree as defined by this article shall be removed except in accordance with this section. 
                  (1)  Justification for removal. Any applicant proposing to remove a specimen tree(s) regulated by this article shall apply for a tree removal permit. In addition to the requirements for tree removal permits specified by this article, the applicant shall provide a written explanation as to why the specimen tree(s) cannot be retained on the site which shall include a description of all alternative site development plans considered by the applicant to avoid the removal of said specimen tree(s). Said written explanation shall at minimum include the following: 
                  a.  Consideration of whether any buildings or structures, parking areas, stormwater facilities, utilities, driveways or other features of the proposed development can be relocated or designed to retain the specimen tree(s), and the additional costs of such relocations or designs, if any. 
                  b.  Consideration of whether the land area consumed by the proposed development can be reduced via decked parking, reduction of the footprint of a building or structure by increasing the height or number of stories, placement of stormwater facilities underground, and other appropriate means, to retain the specimen tree(s) and the additional costs involved in such surface area consumption, if any. 
                  c.  Consideration of whether the development proposal can be reduced in size, scale, or extent without jeopardizing the economic feasibility of the proposed development. 
                  d.  The total estimated value of the development before approval and upon completion as proposed, if approved. 
                  (2)  Building inspector approval. An application to remove a specimen tree shall require the approval of the building inspector, after review by and recommendation from the arborist. The building inspector may issue a permit to remove one (1) or more specimen trees after finding that one (1) or more of the following conditions are met: 
                  a.  The written analysis provides convincing evidence that alternative site and building designs have been considered by the applicant but would not result in retention of the specimen tree(s). 
                  b.  The additional costs associated with developing the site or constructing buildings as redesigned or reducing the site area consumed to retain the specimen tree(s) would be disproportional to the value of the specimen tree(s) retained, calculated at one hundred dollars ($100.00) per tree density unit. 
                  c.  Retention of the specimen tree(s) would result in less viable economic use of the subject property. 
                  d.  If more than one (1) specimen tree is proposed to be removed, the site design results in the minimum number of specimen trees removed that are necessary to accommodate the proposed development. 
                  e.  A variance to the dimensional requirements of the zoning ordinance may be an appropriate remedy to preserve a specimen tree. Where in the opinion of the building inspector one (1) or more variances would enable a site and building design to be accomplished while saving one (1) or more specimen trees, and where the objectives of tree protection would outweigh the purposes of the zoning regulations that would be varied, the building inspector may suggest an applicant apply for variances instead of proposing to remove one (1) or more specimen trees. In the event of a determination by the building inspector that one or more variances to the dimensional requirements of the zoning ordinance would not be appropriate, the building inspector should apply the above standards to determine if there is reason to support a finding in favor of granting approval to remove one (1) or more specimen trees. 
                  f.  The request to remove a specimen tree or trees is reasonable considering the remaining specimen trees on the site that will be retained. 
                  g.  The building inspector may apply any or all decision criteria for the removal of trees as specified in this section. 
                  The building inspector may approve or deny any application for a tree removal permit based on the above criteria. Although this article shall not be construed to be a zoning ordinance, the determination of the building inspector pursuant to this provision may be appealed in accordance with section 23-1401. 
                  (3)  Tree bank contribution. When removal of a specimen tree(s) is approved by the arborist, as a condition precedent to issuing said tree removal permit, the project applicant shall contribute to the tree bank an amount of five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each tree density unit of the specimen tree(s) removed, calculated on the basis of Table 1 of this article. In any case where a specimen tree was removed without or prior to a lawfully issued tree removal permit, the amount contributed to the tree bank shall be one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per tree density unit of the specimen tree removed. The tree removal permit shall not be issued, nor shall the specimen tree(s) be removed, until funds are received for deposit in the tree bank. Said amount is in addition to any tree bank contribution which may be required under this section of this article. 
                  (4)  Recompense. Contributions to the tree bank may be adjusted by recompense subject to the following criteria: 
                  a.  Credit, based on the tree density units as specified in Table 2, may be given for new trees planted on the subject site, above and beyond the minimum site density requirements, if approved by the arborist. 
                  b.  Such newly planted trees shall be of the caliper of four (4) inches or greater. 
                  c.  In cases where the obligation is not fully reduced by recompensed trees, the remaining obligation shall be deposited to the tree bank and calculated based on five hundred dollars ($500.00) per density unit. 
                  (b)  Criteria for removal of trees. This section is intended to guide the arborist in considering whether nonspecimen trees shall be permitted to be removed. At the discretion of the building inspector, the provisions of this section may be used along with other criteria specified in section 5-272 in determining whether specimen trees shall be permitted to be removed. 
                  (1)  Tree removal shall be disallowed if soil erosion or runoff problems will result due to topography, soil type, or proximity to floodplain or river protection areas; or if the removal will substantially alter the existing soils adversely with regard to runoff and erosion. Information submitted by an environmental specialist may be used by the arborist in such an evaluation. 
                  (2)  Removal of nonspecimen trees from a site may be allowed at the discretion of the arborist if: 
                  a.  The tree is located in an area where a structure or improvement will be placed and the tree cannot be relocated on the site because of age. 
                  b.  The tree is diseased or structurally unsound. 
                  c.  The tree is injured and/or poses an imminent danger. 
                  d.  The tree interferes with existing utility service. 
                  e.  The tree creates an unsafe vision clearance for vehicular movement. 
                  (c)  Tree removal and construction companies. 
                  (1)  All provisions of this article shall apply to any person removing trees on behalf of any other person, including all tree removal companies, utility companies or persons in the business of removing trees or construction. It shall be unlawful for any person or company to remove or cause to be removed any tree, or undertake any work for which a land disturbance permit is required pursuant to this article, unless a valid permit thereof is in effect and is displayed in accordance with the provisions of this article. If any such work or removal is performed without the permit being displayed as required in this article, such removal or work shall constitute a violation of this article and shall subject the person or company violating this article to all penalties provided herein. However, utility companies may provide emergency work without formal approval; provided, however, that emergency actions are reported in writing to the arborist within three (3) working days after completion of all emergency services. Further, the permit taken by any person, company or utility may include defined areas of tree cutting and trimming under one (1) permit. 
                  (2)  All tree removal companies, utility companies or persons in the business of removing trees or construction shall remove from the site any trees, stumps, limbs or debris caused by activities allowed by the issuance of a permit under this section. 
                  (Ord. No. 2009-12, § 1, 5-26-09) 
                  Sec. 5-273. - Tree replacement and planting. 
                  (a)  Minimum tree density requirements. 
                  (1)  Requirement. A basic requirement of this article is that all applicable sites, including all single-family and/or duplex residential lots one (1) acre or greater in size, shall maintain a minimum tree density of thirty (30) units per acre. The term "unit" is an expression of basal area, and is not synonymous with "tree." The density requirement must be met whether or not a site had trees prior to development for the issuance of a land disturbance permit. 
                  (2)  Methods of achievement. The minimum required tree unit density may be achieved by counting existing trees to be preserved, by planting new trees according to the minimum standards in this article, or by a combination of the two (2). Only existing trees of not less than three (3) inches caliper, to be left in good growing condition on the property, shall be counted toward the minimum required density units. 
                  (3)  Calculation of tree density requirements. The minimum tree density required for any given lot subject to the requirements of this article shall be calculated and established pursuant to the formula and analysis set forth in Appendix A to this article. The minimum required tree density units shall be calculated on the basis of total (gross) area of the site or lot in question, excluding existing easements that are required to be cleared of trees. 
                  (b)  Alternative compliance to tree density requirements. 
                  (1)  Intent. The intent of this article is to ensure that a minimum density of trees is maintained on all developed sites. Occasionally, this intent cannot be met because a site will not bear the required density of trees. To provide an alternative in such cases, at the discretion of the arborist, the applicant may contribute funds to the tree bank. 
                  (2)  Standards. The following standards have been established for administering this alternative compliance method. The arborist must review and approve all requests for alternative compliance. In no instance shall more than ninety (90) percent of the required site density be met through alternative compliance. As many trees as can reasonably be expected to survive must be planted on the site in question. This provision may require planting less trees of a larger caliper than the minimum required caliper. 
                  (3)  Permit. No land disturbance permit shall be issued until the arborist has approved the request and funds are received for deposit into the tree bank. 
                  (4)  Tree bank. The City of Doraville will accept donations to the Doraville Tree Bank. These donations will be used for the sole purpose of planting trees for public benefit on public property or private property within a public easement within the City of Doraville. For calculating contributions to the tree bank, see Appendix C to this article. 
                  (5)  Fund administration. The tree bank will be administered by the City Manager or designee's office with disbursements of the tree bank funds initiated by the arborist and approved by the City Manager or designee. A report shall be prepared by the Doraville Finance Department/City Manager or designee's office and submitted to the City Manager or designee showing amounts collected, amounts spent, and the type and location of trees planted. The annual audit prepared by an independent auditor shall suffice to meet this requirement. 
                  (c)  Tree replacement plan. Trees must be relocated or replaced on site in accordance with the provisions of this section, unless alternative compliance is permitted pursuant to section 5-272. 
                  (1)  Separate drawing. A separate tree replacement plan indicating the location of all proposed trees for revegetation is required. This plan shall be submitted as a separate drawing but may be subject to the arborist's approval to be included as a part of the Doraville Tree Protection Plan. 
                  (2)  Planting schedules and species names. The tree replacement plan shall include planting schedules with proposed tree species names (botanical and common), quantity, size, spacing and any special planting notes. 
                  (3)  Approved trees. Unless otherwise approved by the arborist, trees selected for replanting must be on the tree species selection list found in Appendix B to this article. Invasive trees shall not be allowed under any circumstances. Trees selected must be free from injury, pests, disease, nutritional disorders or root defects, and must be in good vigor in order to assure a reasonable expectation of survivability. It is desirable that replanted trees be ecologically compatible with site and neighboring sites. Accordingly, the replanted trees shall be of the same or similar species as those removed when practical. 
                  (4)  Flowering ornamental trees. The use of flowering ornamental trees or plants classified as large shrubs may be included in the tree replacement plan, but shall not be used for the purpose of meeting minimum tree density unit requirements for the site unless approved by the arborist. 
                  (5)  Transplanting of trees. Standards for transplanting shall be in keeping with those established in the international Society of Arboriculture publication "Tree and Shrub Planting Manual." 
                  (6)  Overstory/understory ratio. Replanting shall be at the ratio of not less than one (1) overstory tree for every three (3) understory trees. Density credit may be met by planting all overstory trees, but not by planting only understory trees. Refer to Appendix A for minimum size requirements for replacement trees. 
                  (7)  Replacement tree size and height. All replanted overstory trees shall be a minimum of eight (8) feet tall and have a trunk of not less than three (3) caliper inches. All replaced understory trees shall be a minimum of six (6) feet tall and have a trunk of not less than two (2) inches. In order to provide sufficient growing area for planted trees, the minimum criteria must be observed unless otherwise approved by the arborist: 
                  Overstory trees—Two hundred (200) square feet of pervious root zone. 
                  Understory trees—Seventy-five (75) square feet of pervious root zone. 
                  Impervious surface area may encroach into no more than thirty (30) percent of the pervious root zone of a tree to be protected or planted, with techniques approved by the arborist. 
                  (8)  Diversity. No more than forty (40) percent of any one (1) genus may be included in any replanting plan. Exceptions to this requirement may be authorized by the arborist, where in his or her opinion, an exception is justified based on compliance with the purpose of this article. 
                  (9)  Planting and staking details. Planting and staking details shall be provided on the plan as determined by the arborist using International Society of Arboriculture (ISA) standards. 
                  (10)  Debris. All debris from trees cut or substantial damage shall be removed from the site or chipped in a timely fashion including the removal or chipping of any portion of the tree stump above the original natural grade or elevation of land unless exempted by the arborist for a specific reason such as, but not limited to, unusually large size or age. 
                  (11)  Practices. The City of Doraville encourages environmentally sustainable design practices, such as drought-tolerant landscaping, keeping turf away from native trees, and planting trees strategically for energy conservation. 
                  (12)  Maintenance. All replacement trees will be maintained properly to ensure their survivability. 
                  (d)  Street trees. The requirements of this section shall be independent of and in addition to all other sections of this article. 
                  (1)  Required. Street tree planting is required along all new local, collector, and arterial streets in the City of Doraville and private streets within commercial, industrial or residential subdivisions. 
                  (2)  Responsibility. The subdivider, owner of land to be dedicated as a public street, or the developer of a private street, shall at the time of preliminary plat approval, submit a plan for the provision of street trees along all said roads. It is the intent of this section that the subdivider carefully position street trees on the plan while taking into account future driveway and sidewalk locations if not constructed simultaneously with the construction of the public or private street, suitable arrangements must be made for either the subdivider/developer or individual builders to install street trees according to a plan approved by the City Council as a part of preliminary plat approval, prior to dedication or opening of said street. It is the preference of the City that the subdivider shall install said street trees prior to the dedication or opening of the public or private street; however, the City Council may accept an agreement where the responsibility for street tree planting is shifted to the owners or individual builders of the lots to be subdivided. Any such responsibility shall be legally transferred in a form acceptable to the City Attorney. 
                  (3)  Location. Trees must be planted within the public right-of-way or if right-of-way width is insufficient to accommodate said street trees, then they may be planted on private property abutting the public right-of-way within a street tree easement dedicated to the City. For local, arterial and collector streets with speeds less than or equal to forty-five (45) m.p.h.: on streets with curb and gutter, street trees should be a minimum of one and one-half (1.5) feet behind the curb and may be placed between the sidewalk, if present, and the back of the curb. On streets without curb and gutter, the trees should be at least seven (7) to twenty (20) feet from the edge of the traveled way. A bike path is not considered part of the traveled way. Adequate sight distance must be available from intersecting streets and driveways. Utility installations must be coordinated with tree locations. In many cases, the underground locations have the potential for conflict. Street trees shall have equal bearing when considering utility location. 
                  (4)  Guidelines. The guidelines below are intended to avoid conflicts with infrastructure; they are recommendations only and are subject to the approval of the arborist and, in the case of preliminary plat review, the City Council. 

                   
                  (e)  Minimum landscaping requirements for surface parking lots. All new parking facilities for new multi-family and non-residential uses shall present a landscape plan to the Community Development Director for approval, indicating that the surface parking lot will meet the minimum barrier curb and landscaping requirements as follows: 
                  (1)  Barrier curbs or landscape strips shall be installed around the perimeter of the parking lot and around landscaped areas that are required in this article, except where the perimeter abuts an adjacent building or structure, at points of ingress and egress into the facility, and at points of stormwater runoff so as to prevent encroachment of vehicles onto adjacent property, rights-of-way and landscaped areas. 
                  (2)  Barrier curbs or wheel stops shall be a minimum of six (6) inches in height and a minimum of eight (8) inches in width and permanent in nature. Barrier curbs and wheel stops shall be constructed of concrete or other durable material. Such curbs shall be securely installed and maintained in good condition. 
                  (3)  Where the end of a parking space abuts a landscaped area, barrier curbs or wheel stops shall be placed in the parking space at a minimum of two (2) feet from the end of the parking space adjacent to the landscaped area. This two-foot wide area may have the pavement removed and be developed as part of the required landscaped area. 
                  (4)  Surface parking lots shall have a minimum landscaped area equal to at least ten (10) percent of the paved area of the lot. 
                  (5)  A minimum of one (1) drought tolerant, overstory tree per eight (8) parking spaces shall be included in the required landscaped areas. For the purpose of satisfying this requirement, existing trees remaining that are two and one-half (2½) inches or more in DBH, and are located inside the proposed parking lot or adjacent to within twenty (20) feet of the parking lot, shall be considered to be equivalent to one (1) or more newly planted trees on the basis of one (1) tree for each two and one-half (2½) inches of caliper. 
                  (6)  In addition to trees, ground cover shall also be provided to protect tree roots and to prevent erosion. Ground cover shall consist of plants, organic mulch and other similar landscaping materials. Such ground cover shall be maintained at a maximum height of two and one-half (2½) feet, except where such shrubs are screening the parking surface from an adjacent residential use. Plants shall not be planted within the structural rootplate of trees; plantings within the critical root zone shall be dug by hand. 
                  (7)  Trees planted in the interior of a parking lot shall comply with the minimum pervious root zone requirements noted in this article. 
                  (8)  Continuous landscaped buffer strips shall be constructed along sidewalks and public rights-of-way where surface parking lots are adjacent to such sidewalks or public rights-of-way except at points of ingress and egress into the facility. Such landscaped buffer strips shall be a minimum of five (5) feet in width and shall contain, in addition to ground cover, trees planted a maximum of forty (40) feet on center along the entire length. Trees shall be planted at a minimum of thirty (30) inches from any barrier curb so as to prevent injury to trees from vehicle bumpers. 
                  (9)  Where landscaped area is located adjacent to vehicle overhangs, the trees shall be planted in line with the side stripes between parking spaces in order to avoid injury to trees by vehicle bumpers. 
                  (10)  All landscaped areas, including trees located in the public right-of-way that are counted in the fulfillment of this requirement, shall be properly maintained in accordance with approved landscape plans. If a tree or any plant material dies, it shall be replaced within six (6) months so as to meet all requirements of this section and to allow for planting in the appropriate planting season. 
                  (11)  The Community Development Director may allow a reduction of parking spaces up to ten (10) percent of the minimum required spaces to comply with the parking lot landscape requirements of this section. 
                  (12)  Upon written application by any person subject to the provisions of this section, the Community Development Director is hereby authorized to grant administrative variances to the requirements of this section only upon making all of the following findings: 
                  a.  There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape, topography, subsurface conditions, overhead structures or the existence of sufficient trees in the public right-of-way within ten (10) feet and adjacent to the parking lot. 
                  b.  Such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of property involved; and 
                  c.  Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purposes and intent of this article and of chapter 23 of this Code.

                  Sec. 5-274. - Application and permits. 
                  (a)  Application requirements. When a person applies for a land disturbance permit, such person shall also file an application for a tree removal permit providing the following information: 
                  (1)  A complete tree survey, as specified in section 5-271. 
                  (2)  A complete tree protection plan, as specified in section 5-271. 
                  (3)  A complete tree replacement plan, as specified in section 5-271. 
                  The arborist shall be authorized to and may waive the application requirements of this article in cases where the proposed development will not involve the removal or replacement of trees, or in cases where the submission of a tree survey, tree protection plan, and/or tree replacement plan would be unduly burdensome given the nature of the development proposed; provided, however, that the arborist shall in all instances at least require a sketch showing proposed changes to ensure compliance with this article. 
                  Each applicant requesting a permit under the provisions of this article, except those pertaining to property solely within a public right-of-way, shall deposit with the City of Doraville a fee as set forth by the Mayor and City Council, as amended from time to time. The fee shall be nonrefundable. 
                  (b)  Permit procedures. 
                  (1)  Approval by arborist. Prior to the issuance of a tree removal permit and a land disturbance permit, a tree survey, tree protection plan, and tree replacement plan must be submitted to and approved by the arborist as required by this article. Said arborist's approval must be achieved prior to submission of a final design plan application to the City Council, whichever has jurisdiction. All tree surveys, tree protection plans, and tree replacement plans and related documentation shall be reviewed by the arborist for conformance with the provisions of this article and either approved, returned for revision, or denied. If denied, the reasons for denial shall be annotated on the application and/or plans, as appropriate or otherwise stated in writing. 
                  (2)  Relationship to other reviews. Approved tree surveys, tree protection plans, and tree replacement plans shall be accepted by the City Council, as a pre-approved element of the design plan or certificate of appropriateness, respectively. 
                  (3)  Issuance. After the tree survey, tree protection plan, and tree replacement plan are approved, and after the remaining elements of the design plan are approved by the City Council, tree removal permits shall be issued and development plan approvals with regard to conformance with this article shall be granted. 
                  (4)  Inspections. All tree protection measures shall be installed prior to any land disturbance, and the arborist shall be contacted for a pre-construction conference prior to land disturbance. As a condition of the issuance of a permit, the applicant shall agree in writing to entry onto the applicant's premises by representatives of the City as designated by the arborist to inspect the permit and activities at any time, and such entry shall be lawful. Failure to allow such entry shall be unlawful and shall constitute failure to display the permit as required under this section. Land disturbance may proceed only after a tree removal permit and land disturbance permit are obtained. The arborist shall make unscheduled inspections before and during development to ensure protection of trees, critical root zones, drip lines, and buffer zones. After completion of a development, but prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, the arborist will conduct an on-site inspection of the site to ensure compliance with the approved tree protection plan and approved tree replacement plan. The building inspector will be charged with the responsibility of inspecting the site to ensure that trees are adequately protected during any grading of the property for infrastructure installation. 
                  (5)  Display of permit. The applicant shall prominently display the tree removal permit on the site for which the permit is issued. Such permit shall be displayed continuously while trees are being removed or replaced or work done as authorized on the permit. 
                  (Ord. No. 2009-12, § 1, 5-26-09) 
                  Sec. 5-275. - Administration and enforcement. 
                  (a)  Emergencies. In case of emergencies, such as hurricane, windstorm, flood, freeze or other disasters, the requirements of these regulations may be waived by the arborist or other designated official, upon a finding that such waiver is necessary so that the public or private work to restore order in the City will not be impeded. 
                  (b)  Variances. Although this article shall not be construed to be a zoning ordinance, the Mayor and City Council may, upon appropriate application in accordance with section 23-1402 of the Zoning Code, grant a variance to the terms and provisions of this article. 
                  (c)  Appeals. Although this article shall not be construed to be a zoning ordinance, any person adversely affected by a decision of the arborist or building inspector in the administration, enforcement or interpretation of any of the terms or provisions of this article may appeal such decision to the Mayor and City Council in accordance with the provisions of section 23-1401 of the zoning code. 
                  (d)  Withholding of certificate of occupancy. The building inspector may withhold the issuance of the required certificate of occupancy, or permits and inspections, for any development until the provisions of this article have been fully met. 
                  (e)  Enforcement and penalties. 
                  (1)  Penalties. Any person, firm or corporation violating any provisions of this article shall upon conviction be punished as described in section 1-12 of the Municipal Code of the City of Doraville, which provides for fines up to one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), imprisonment up to ninety (90) days and/or community service up to ninety (90) days. In addition, the person, firm or corporation may be enjoined from continuing the violation. Each tree cut, damaged or poisoned shall constitute a separate offense. 
                  (2)  Stop-work orders. Upon issuance of a stop-work order by the building inspector, work on any project that is being done contrary to the provisions of this article shall be immediately stopped, such notice shall be in writing and shall be given to the owner of the property, the owner's authorized agent or the person or persons in charge of the activity on the property, and shall state the conditions under which work may be resumed. Where an emergency exists, no written notice shall be required. A stop-work order shall be considered a suspension of the land disturbance permit. 
                  (3)  Suspension, revocation or modification of permits. A tree removal permit and/or land disturbance permit may be suspended, revoked or modified by the building inspector upon a finding that the holder is in violation of the terms of the permit or any portion of this article.

                  Sec. 5-277. - Appendices. 
                  (a)  Appendix A—Density Factor Analysis. A basic condition of this article is that all applicable sites maintain a minimum tree density of thirty (30) units per acre. The term "unit" is an expression of basal area and is not synonymous with "tree." 
                  The minimum tree density requirement must be met whether or not a site had trees prior to development. The density may be achieved by counting existing trees to be preserved, planting new trees, or some combination of the two (2). 
                  For density factor analysis, the following formula shall apply: 
                  SDF = EDF + RDF 
                  WHERE: 
                  SDF (Site Density Factor) = The minimum tree density required to be maintained on a developed site (thirty (30) units per acre). 
                  EDF (Existing Density Factor) = Density of new trees to be planted on a site. 
                  RDF (Replacement Density Factor) = Density of new trees to be planted on a site. 
                  PROCEDURE FOR CALCULATING THE REQUIRED TREE PLACEMENT:

                  CONVERTING EXISTING TREE DIAMETERS INTO DENSITY UNITS 

                   
                  TABLE 2 
                  CONVERTING REPLACEMENT TREES TO DENSITY UNITS 

                   
                  A seven-gallon container-grown pine tree is given replacement credit of 0.3 units. The minimum tree size for an understory tree is two (2) inches. The minimum size for an overstory tree is three (3) inches. 
                  For tree relocation, replacement units will be granted to trees relocated on site. Tree relocation is subject to the arborist's approval.

                  Understory Trees 

                   
                  (c)  Appendix C—Formula for Determining Contributions to The Tree Bank The required contribution amount is five hundred dollars ($500.00) per tree density unit, based on cost of materials, labor and guarantee for trees planted in the Doraville area. 
                  EXAMPLE: To determine the appropriate contribution, first calculate the Density Factor Deficient (DFD) or unit value which cannot be planted on the site. 
                  Determine the Density Factor Deficient (DFD) using the formula: 
                  DFD = SDF - EDF - Approved RDF 
                  WHERE: 
                  SDF (Site Density Factor) = The minimum tree density required to be maintained on a developed site (thirty (30) units per acre or whatever Doraville chooses). 
                  EXAMPLE: A 2.2-acre site will have a required Site Density Factor of 66.0 units (2.2 × 30 = 66). 
                  EDF (Existing Density Factor) = Density of existing trees to be preserved on a site. The site has existing trees totaling 45.9 units (Existing Density Factor). 
                  Approved RDF (Replacement Density Factor) = Density of new trees to be planted on a site. Due to space limitations, the site can only bear 15.0 units as replacement trees. 
                  EXAMPLE: 
                  DFD = SDF - EDF - Approved RDF 
                  DFD = 66 - 45.9 - 15 
                  DFD = 5.1 (the number of tree density units that cannot be planted on site) 
                  This means that the value of 5.1 tree density units must be contributed to the Doraville Tree Bank. Determine the acceptable contribution amount as follows: 
                  5.1 tree density units × $500.00 per tree density unit = $2,550.00 
                  $2,550 = Total Contribution to Tree Bank

                  Sec. 5-279. - Permit. 
                  (a)  Upon making application, the applicant shall be assigned a permit having a designated permit number which shall be displayed at the location. 
                  (b)  The applicant at the time of filing his, her or its application with the City Clerk, shall pay a twenty-five dollar ($25.00) fee to cover the clerical cost of the City. 
                  (c)  Tree Service Contractors, which shall include anyone performing the work that is not the owner or occupier of the property, at the time of filing shall present a copy of a valid, current Occupational Tax License from the State of Georgia and a copy of valid, current liability insurance. 
                  (d)  After the trees and limbs have been cut or trimmed, they shall be removed from the subject premises by applicant. The applicant shall then inform the City Clerk. After the location has been inspected by the City Arborist and it is shown that the trees, shrubs, limbs and all debris have been collected and removed from the premises, the permit shall be signed by the City Arborist indicating all work has been completed. Failure of the applicant to remove the limbs, trunks and debris from the premises, or the failure of the applicant to receive the signature of the City Arborist, shall subject the applicant to the punishment as set out herein. 
                  (e)  This section shall not be used to acquire a permit to remove trees with the intent to develop the property. It shall be evidence of such intent if the owner or occupier of the property applies for a land disturbance permit for those sections of the property where any trees were removed pursuant to the permit requirements in this section wtihin fifteen (15) months of the trees being removed.

                  Base year franchise fee factor means the total franchise fees paid during the base year divided by the design day capacity as recorded by the company on the last day of the base year.

                  Where FF c = total franchise fees due the City for the current fiscal year 
                  FFF by = the base year franchise fee factor 
                  CPI-PFA = the inflation index based on the cumulative change in the Consumer Price Index less the productivity factor adjustment determined by the Georgia Public Service Commission. 
                  DDC c = the design day capacity as of the last day of the previous fiscal year.

                  FF by = the total franchise fees paid in the base year

                  Editor's note— Section 1 of Ord. No. 2014-13, adopted Dec. 15, 2014, repealed art. IX in its entirety and enacted new provisions to read as herein set out. Former art. IX, §§ 6-296—6-320 pertained to massage parlors and derived from Ord. No. 2011-01, § 1, adopted Jan. 3, 2011; Ord. No. 2011-38, § 4, adopted Nov. 7, 2011; Ord. No. 2012-08, §§ 1, 2, adopted March 22, 2012; Ord. No. 2013-11, § 1, adopted June 17, 2013. 
                  State Law reference— Deceptive trade practices with respect to health spas, O.C.G.A. § 10-1-392 et seq.; giving of massages in place used for lewdness, prostitution or masturbation for hire, O.C.G.A. § 16-6-17; Georgia Physical Therapy Act, O.C.G.A. § 43-33-1 et seq.; levy of occupational tax on practitioners of massage and physiotherapy only at place of principal office, O.C.G.A. § 48-13-5. 

                  Sec. 6-296. - Purpose and legislative findings. 
                  The Georgia General Assembly has declared that the practice of massage therapy is an activity affecting the public interest and involving the health, safety, and welfare of the public and that the practice of massage therapy by a person who is not licensed under the Georgia Massage Therapy Practice Act (O.C.G.A. §§ 43-24A-1 et seq.) is a public nuisance, harmful to the public health, safety, and welfare. The City Council agrees with those findings. Furthermore, the City Council finds that, for many massage establishments, the business in fact is sexual conduct or the intimation of sexual conduct, rather than lawful massage therapy. Such establishments offer massage services as a subterfuge for prostitution, masturbation for hire, and other paid sexual contact, which are harmful to the public health, safety, and welfare. There is difficulty and expense in conclusively distinguishing between such establishments and legitimate massage establishments, but one (1) rational distinction is whether the establishment has a relationship with a corporate or franchising hierarchy, which would tend to safeguard against unlawful sexual activities on the massage establishment premises. It is a purpose of this article to impose licensing requirements to help prevent illegal massage, prostitution, and related sex crimes, yet without hindering legitimate massage establishments operating under a business structure with external oversight that serves that purpose. Pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 43-24A-22 (allowing local regulation of massage businesses and of persons not licensed by the state), it is the purpose of this article to regulate the operation of massage establishments and spa establishments, and to regulate employees of such establishments who are not licensed as massage therapists by the state, as an exercise of the City's police power in order to protect the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of the City.

                  Sec. 6-302. - Employee work permits required. 
                  (a)  Massage/spa establishment work permit required. It shall be unlawful for any person to be an "employee," as defined in this article, of a massage establishment or a spa establishment in the City without a valid massage/spa establishment work permit, except that a person who holds a valid massage/spa establishment license or who is listed in response to subsections 6-300(b)(7)a—c. in relation to a valid massage/spa establishment license shall not be required to also obtain a massage/spa establishment work permit to be an "employee" at that particular licensed establishment. A person who works at more than one (1) establishment shall obtain a separate work permit for each establishment. No applicant for a massage/spa establishment work permit shall work at a massage establishment or a spa establishment in the City until the applicant receives, and the establishment posts, the employee's work permit as required by this article. A receipt issued by the City is not a valid massage/spa establishment work permit and does not authorize the person to work in a massage establishment or spa establishment. 
                  (b)  Application. An applicant for a massage/spa establishment work permit shall file in person at the Doraville City Hall a completed application made on a form provided by the City.

                  (5)  The name and address of the massage establishment or spa establishment for which the applicant seeks to obtain the work permit. 
                  (6)  A statement of whether the applicant has been an owner, director, officer, partner, member, or shareholder of a massage establishment or spa establishment that has, in the previous five (5) years (and at a time during which the person was so related to the establishment):

                  The information provided pursuant to this subsection (b) shall be supplemented in writing by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the Doraville City Clerk within ten (10) working days of a change of circumstances which would render the information originally submitted false or incomplete. 
                  (c)  The information provided by an applicant in connection with an application for a work permit under this article shall be maintained on a confidential basis, and such information may [be] disclosed to the public only as required under governing law. Any information protected by the right to privacy as recognized by state or federal law shall be redacted prior to any required disclosure under the Georgia Open Records Act or other applicable law. 
                  (d)  Issuance of work permit. Upon the filing of a completed massage/spa establishment work permit application, the City shall cause to be conducted a criminal background investigation of the applicant and shall transmit a summary of the investigation results to the City Clerk or his or her designee. Within thirty (30) days of the filing of a completed massage/spa establishment work permit application, the City Clerk or his or her designee shall either issue a work permit to the applicant or issue a written notice denying the work permit to the applicant. The City Clerk or his or her designee shall issue the work permit unless: 
                  (1)  The applicant is less than eighteen (18) years of age. 
                  (2)  The applicant has failed to provide information required by this article for issuance of a work permit or has falsely answered a question or request for information on the application form.

                  (6)  The applicant has within the previous five (5) years been convicted of, or pleaded guilty or entered a plea of nolo contendere to, a specified criminal activity, as defined in this article. 
                  (e)  The work permit, if issued, will be valid for a period of one (1) year from the date it is issued. Replacement and additional work permit(s) shall be issued upon payment of one-half (½) of the fee charged for a work permit and will expire the same date as the then-current work permit. A massage establishment or spa establishment employee shall provide the employee's work permit to the establishment for which it was issued to be posted on the premises pursuant to this article. 
                  (f)  The City Clerk or his or her designee shall issue a written notice of intent to revoke an employee's work permit, following notice and hearing pursuant to subsection 1-15(b) of this Code, and demand its return if the employee has violated the provisions of this article, any state law or applicable local ordinance. 
                  (g)  It shall be unlawful for an employee whose work permit has been revoked to refuse to return the work permit to the Doraville City Clerk or to alter, conceal, deface, or destroy the work permit.

                  (b)  Massage establishments and spa establishments shall maintain correct and accurate records of each instance that a service is provided, the type of service provided, and the name of the person at the establishment who provided the service.

                  (c)  No massage establishment or spa establishment shall allow any person required to have any state mandated licenses, or a massage/spa establishment work permit pursuant to this article, to perform any service on the premises until such person has procured such license or work permit.

                  (1)  Sexually oriented businesses, as a category of commercial uses, are associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects including, but not limited to, personal and property crimes, prostitution, potential spread of disease, lewdness, public indecency, obscenity, illicit drug use and drug trafficking, negative impacts on surrounding properties, urban blight, litter, and sexual assault and exploitation. Alcohol consumption impairs judgment and lowers inhibitions, thereby increasing the risk of adverse secondary effects. 
                  (2)  Sexually oriented businesses should be separated from sensitive land uses to minimize the impact of their secondary effects upon such uses, and should be separated from other sexually oriented businesses, to minimize the secondary effects associated with such uses and to prevent an unnecessary concentration of sexually oriented businesses in one (1) area. 
                  (3)  Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm which the City has a substantial government interest in preventing and/or abating. This substantial government interest in preventing secondary effects, which is the City's rationale for this article, exists independent of any comparative analysis between sexually oriented and non-sexually oriented businesses. Additionally, the City's interest in regulating sexually oriented businesses extends to preventing future secondary effects of either current or future sexually oriented businesses that may be located in the City. The City finds that the cases and documentation relied on in this article are reasonably believed to be relevant to said secondary effects. 
                  The City hereby adopts and incorporates herein its stated findings and legislative record related to the adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses, including the judicial opinions and reports related to such secondary effects.

Upon the filing of a completed application for a sexually oriented business license, the City Clerk shall immediately issue a temporary license to the applicant if the completed application is from a preexisting sexually oriented business that is lawfully operating in the City and the completed application, on its face, indicates that the applicant is entitled to an annual sexually oriented business license.

However, this ground for denial of a license to operate a sexually oriented business shall not prevent issuance or renewal of a license for a sexually oriented business that was in a location where a sexually oriented business was allowed under law prior to the effective date of this subsection, provided that the sexually oriented business has not been enlarged; extended; removed; discontinued or abandoned for six (6) months or more; or had its structure destroyed to an extent of more than sixty (60) percent of the structure's fair market value at the time of destruction. 
                  (6)  Any sexually oriented business in which an applicant has had an influential interest, has, in the previous five (5) years (and at a time during which the applicant had the influential interest):

                  (b)  All applicants, whether they are a vehicle immobilization service or an operator, shall furnish all data, information and records relevant to their application requested of them by the City's Police Department, and failure to furnish this data, information and records within thirty (30) days from the date of the request shall automatically result in the dismissal, with prejudice, of the application.

                  ARTICLE III. - ILLICIT DISCHARGE AND ILLEGAL CONNECTION 

                  Sec. 6.5-60. - Introduction. 
                  It is hereby determined that: 
                  Discharges to the City of Doraville separate storm sewer system that are not composed entirely of stormwater runoff contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters. 
                  These non-stormwater discharges occur due to spills, dumping and improper connections to the City of Doraville separate storm sewer system from residential, industrial, commercial or institutional establishments. 
                  These non-stormwater discharges not only impact waterways individually, but geographically dispersed, small volume non-stormwater discharges can have cumulative impacts on receiving waters. 
                  The impacts of these discharges adversely affect public health and safety, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters. 
                  These impacts can be minimized through the regulation of spills, dumping and discharges into the City of Doraville separate storm sewer system. 
                  Localities in the State of Georgia are required to comply with a number of state and federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution due to improper non-stormwater discharges to the City of Doraville separate storm sewer system. 
                  Therefore, the City of Doraville adopts this article to prohibit such non-stormwater discharges to the City separate storm sewer system. It is determined that the regulation of spills, improper dumping and discharges to the City separate storm sewer system is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety, and the environment.

                  ARTICLE IV. - POSTDEVELOPMENT STORMWATER MANAGEMENT FOR NEW DEVELOPMENT AND REDEVELOPMENT 

                  Sec. 6.5-70. - Introduction. 
                  It is hereby determined that: 
                  Land development projects and other land use conversions, and their associated changes to land cover, permanently alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, which in turn increase flooding, stream channel erosion, and sediment transport and deposition; 
                  Land development projects and other land use conversions also contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters; 
                  The impacts of postdevelopment stormwater runoff quantity and quality can adversely affect public safety, public and private property, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters; 
                  These adverse impacts can be controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff quantity and quality from new development and redevelopment, by the use of both structural facilities as well as nonstructural measures, such as the conservation of open space and greenspace areas. The preservation and protection of natural area and greenspace for stormwater management benefits is encouraged through the use of incentives or "credits." The Georgia Greenspace Program provides a mechanism for the preservation and coordination of those greenspace areas that provide stormwater management quality and quantity benefits; 
                  Cities in the State of Georgia are required to comply with a number of both state and federal laws, regulations and permits which require a City to address the impacts of postdevelopment stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution; 
                  Therefore, the City of Doraville has established this set of stormwater management policies to provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of postdevelopment stormwater runoff for the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation. It has determined that it is in the public interest to regulate postdevelopment stormwater runoff discharges in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes, post-construction soil erosion and sedimentation, stream channel erosion, and nonpoint source pollution associated with postdevelopment stormwater runoff. 
                  (Ord. No. 04-12, § 1, 6-7-04) 
                  Sec. 6.5-71. - General provisions. 
                  (a)  Purpose and intent. The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased postdevelopment stormwater runoff and nonpoint source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment. It has been determined that proper management of postdevelopment stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety, environment and general welfare of the public, and protect water and aquatic resources. This article seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives: 
                  (1)  Establish decision-making processes surrounding land development activities that protect the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources; 
                  (2)  Require that new development and redevelopment maintain the predevelopment hydrologic response in their postdevelopment state as nearly as practicable in order to reduce flooding, streambank and channel erosion, nonpoint source pollution and increases in stream temperature, and maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats; 
                  (3)  Establish minimum postdevelopment stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality; 
                  (4)  Establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater control facilities that can be used to meet the minimum postdevelopment stormwater management standards; 
                  (5)  Encourage the use of nonstructural stormwater management and stormwater better site design practices, such as the preservation of greenspace and other conservation areas, to the maximum extent practicable. Coordinate site design plans, which include greenspace, with the City's greenspace protection plan; 
                  (6)  Establish provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of structural stormwater control facilities and nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained, and pose no threat to public safety; and 
                  (7)  Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans, and for the inspection of approved active projects, and long-term follow up. 
                  (b)  Applicability. 
                  (1)  This article shall be applicable to all land development, including, but not limited to, site clearing applications, site plan applications, subdivision applications, and grading applications, unless exempt pursuant to subsection 6.5-71(b)(2) below.

                  a.  New development that involves the creation of five thousand (5,000) square feet or more of impervious cover, regardless of site size; 
                  b.  Redevelopment that includes the creation, addition or replacement of five thousand (5,000) square feet or more of impervious cover, regardless of site size; 
                  c.  Any new development or redevelopment, regardless of site size, that is defined by the City Clerk to be a hotspot land use; or 
                  d.  Land development activities that are smaller than the minimum applicability criteria set forth in items a. and b. above if such activities are part of a larger common plan of development, even though multiple, separate and distinct land development activities may take place at different times on different schedules. 
                  (2)  The following activities are exempt from this article: 
                  a.  Individual single-family or duplex residential lots that are not part of a subdivision comprised of three (3) or more lots; 
                  b.  Additions or modifications to existing single-family or duplex residential structures; 
                  c.  Agricultural or silvicultural land management activities within areas zoned for these activities; and 
                  d.  Repairs to any stormwater management facility or practice deemed necessary by the City Clerk.

                  Sec. 6.5-74. - Postdevelopment stormwater management performance criteria. 
                  The following performance criteria shall be applicable to all stormwater management plans, unless otherwise provided for in this article: 
                  (a)  Water quality. All stormwater runoff generated from a site shall be adequately treated before discharge. It will be presumed that a stormwater management system complies with this requirement if: 
                  (1)  It is sized to treat the prescribed water quality treatment volume from the site, as defined in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual; 
                  (2)  Appropriate structural stormwater controls or nonstructural practices are selected, designed, constructed or preserved, and maintained according to the specific criteria in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual; and 
                  (3)  Runoff from hotspot land uses and activities identified by the City are adequately treated and addressed through the use of appropriate structural stormwater controls, nonstructural practices and pollution prevention practices. 
                  (b)  Stream channel protection. Protection of stream channels from bank and bed erosion and degradation shall be provided by using all of the following three (3) approaches: 
                  (1)  Preservation, restoration and/or reforestation (with native vegetation) of the applicable stream buffer; 
                  (2)  Twenty-four-hour extended detention storage of the one-year, twenty-four-hour return frequency storm event; 
                  (3)  Erosion prevention measures such as energy dissipation and velocity control. 
                  (c)  Overbank flooding protection. Downstream overbank flood and property protection shall be provided by controlling (attenuating) the postdevelopment peak discharge rate to the predevelopment rate for the twenty-five-year, twenty-four-hour return frequency storm event. If control of the one-year, twenty-four-hour storm under subsection 6.5-74(b) is exempted, then peak discharge rate attenuation of the two-year through the twenty-five-year return frequency storm event must be provided. This requirement shall not apply for sites where the postdevelopment downstream analysis, acceptable to the City, shows that uncontrolled postdevelopment conditions will not increase downstream peak flows, or that meeting the requirement will cause greater peak flow downstream impacts than the uncontrolled postdevelopment conditions. 
                  (d)  Extreme flooding protection. Extreme flood and public safety protection shall be provided by controlling and safely conveying the one hundred-year, twenty-four-hour return frequency storm event such that flooding is not exacerbated. This requirement shall not apply for sites where the postdevelopment downstream analysis, acceptable to the City, shows that uncontrolled postdevelopment conditions will not increase downstream peak flows, or that meeting the requirement will cause greater peak flow downstream impacts than the uncontrolled postdevelopment conditions. 
                  (e)  Structural stormwater controls. All structural stormwater management facilities shall be selected and designed using the appropriate criteria from the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. All structural stormwater controls must be designed appropriately to meet their intended function. For other structural stormwater controls not included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual, or for which pollutant removal rates have not been provided, the effectiveness and pollutant removal of the structural control must be documented through prior studies, literature reviews, or other means and receive approval from the City before being included in the design of a stormwater management system. In addition, if hydrologic or topographic conditions, or land use activities warrant greater control than that provided by the minimum control requirements, the City may impose additional requirements deemed necessary to protect upstream and downstream properties and aquatic resources from damage due to increased volume, frequency, and rate of stormwater runoff or increased nonpoint source pollution loads created on the site in question. 
                  Applicants shall consult the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual for guidance on the factors that determine site design feasibility when selecting and locating a structural stormwater control. 
                  (f)  Stormwater credits for nonstructural measures. The use of one (1) or more site design measures by the applicant may allow for a reduction in the water quality treatment volume required under subsection 6.5-74(a). The applicant may, if approved by the City, take credit for the use of stormwater better site design practices and reduce the water quality volume requirement. For each potential credit, there is a minimum set of criteria and requirements that identify the conditions or circumstances under which the credit may be applied. The site design practices that qualify for this credit and the criteria and procedures for applying and calculating the credits are included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. 
                  (g)  Drainage system guidelines. Stormwater conveyance facilities, which may include but are not limited to culverts, stormwater drainage pipes, catch basins, drop inlets, junction boxes, headwalls, flared end sections, gutters, swales, channels, ditches, and energy dissipaters, shall be provided when necessary for the protection of public right-of-way and private properties adjoining project sites and/or public rights-of-way. Stormwater conveyance facilities that are designed to carry runoff from more than one (1) parcel, existing or proposed, shall meet the following requirements: 
                  (1)  Methods to calculate stormwater flows shall be in accordance with the stormwater design manual; 
                  (2)  All culverts, pipe systems and open channel flow systems shall be sized in accordance with the stormwater management plan using the methods included in the stormwater design manual; and 
                  (3)  Design and construction of stormwater conveyance facilities shall be in accordance with the criteria and specifications found in the stormwater design manual. 
                  (h)  Dam design guidelines. Any land disturbing activity that involves a site that proposes a dam shall comply with the Georgia Safe Dams Act and Rules for Dam Safety as applicable.

                  --- (2) --- 
                  Editor's note— Ordinance No. 00-12, adopted Dec. 4, 2000, setout provisions pertaining to the environment, specifically Groundwater Recharge Area Protection. Said provisions have been designated as §§ 6.5-90—6.5-100 to maintain the numeric sequencing of the Code. Original numbering can be found in the history notes following each section. 

                  Sec. 6.5-90. - Title. 
                  This article shall be known as the Groundwater Recharge Area Protection Ordinance of the City of Doraville, Georgia. 
                  (Ord. No. 00-12, § 5-450, 12-4-00) 
                  Sec. 6.5-91. - Findings and objectives. 
                  (a)  Finding of facts. In order to provide for the health, safety and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within the City of Doraville, Georgia and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be ensured. For this reason, it is necessary to protect the subsurface water resources that Doraville and surrounding communities rely on as sources of public water. Groundwater resources are contained within aquifers, which are permeable, rock strata occupying vast regions of the subsurface. These aquifers are replenished by infiltration of surface water runoff in zones of the surface known as groundwater recharge areas. 
                  Groundwater is susceptible to contamination when unrestricted development occurs within significant groundwater recharge areas. It is, therefore, necessary to manage land use within groundwater recharge areas in order to ensure that pollution threats are minimized. 
                  (b)  Objectives. The objectives of this article are: 
                  (1)  Protect groundwater quality by restricting land uses that generate, use or store dangerous pollutants in recharge areas; 
                  (2)  Protect groundwater quality by limiting density of development; and 
                  (3)  Protect groundwater quality by ensuring that any development that occurs within the recharge area shall have no adverse effect on groundwater quality. 
                  (Ord. No. 00-12, § 5-451, 12-4-00) 
                  Sec. 6.5-92. - Definitions. 
                  Aquifer means any stratum (rock layer) or zone of rock beneath the surface of the earth capable of containing or producing water from a well. (Note: This is the same definition used in the Groundwater Use Act). 
                  Groundwater recharge area (synonymous with Aquifer recharge area ) means an area of the earth's surface where water infiltrates the ground, thereby replenishing the groundwater supplies within an aquifer. 
                  Pollution susceptibility means the relative vulnerability of groundwater to pollution from chemical spills, leaching of pollutants from dump sites, animal waste from agricultural operations or pollution generated by other human activities. 
                  Pollution susceptibility Map(s) means maps prepared by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources (DNR) that show the relative susceptibility of groundwater to pollution. Pollution susceptibility maps categorize the land areas of the State into areas of high, medium and low groundwater pollution potential. 
                  Significant groundwater recharge areas means areas mapped by DNR in Hydrologic Atlas 18 (1989 edition). Mapping of recharge areas is based on outcrop area, lithology (chemical nature and form of the rock), soil type and thickness, slope, density of lithologic contacts, geologic structure, presence of "karst" topography (sinkholes, caves and fissures associated with limestone and other carbonate rocks), and potentiometric surfaces. 
                  (Ord. No. 00-12, § 5-452, 12-4-00) 
                  Sec. 6.5-93. - Establishment of a groundwater recharge area district. 
                  A groundwater recharge area district is hereby established which shall correspond to all lands within the jurisdiction of the City of Doraville that are mapped as significant recharge areas by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources in Hydrologic Atlas 18, 1989 edition or any subsequent editions thereof.

                  Editor's note— Section 1 of Ord. No. 04-27, adopted Dec. 6, 2004, added provisions designated as art. VI, §§ 6.5-101—6.5-112. Inasmuch as there were already provisions so designated, the provisions have been redesignated as art. VII, §§ 6.5-121—6.5-132, at the discretion of the editor. 

                  Sec. 6.5-121. - Findings. 
                  The Mayor and City Council make the following findings: 
                  The City of Doraville is authorized by the supplementary powers provisions of Article IX, Section II, Paragraph III(a)(6) of the Georgia Constitution to provide a stormwater collection and disposal system throughout the City of Doraville. 
                  The Federal Clean Water Act as amended by the Water Quality Act of 1987 (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) and rules promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to the Act emphasizes the role of local governments in developing, implementing, conducting and funding stormwater programs which address water quality and the impact of stormwater runoff. 
                  Stormwater management is applicable and needed throughout the corporate limits of the City. While specific service and facility demands may differ from area to area at any given point in time, a stormwater management service area encompassing all lands and water bodies within the corporate limits of the City is consistent with the present and future needs of the community. 
                  The stormwater needs in the City include, but are not limited to, protecting the public health, safety and welfare. Provision of stormwater management programs and facilities renders and/or results in both service and benefit to all properties, property owners, citizens, and residents of the City in a variety of ways. The service and benefit rendered or resulting from provision of stormwater management systems and facilities may differ depending on many factors and considerations, including but not limited to, location, demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater systems and programs, and risk exposure. 
                  DeKalb County presently owns and operates stormwater management systems and facilities in the City which have been developed over many years. The future usefulness of the existing stormwater systems owned and operated by the county and of additions and improvements thereto, rests on the ability of the City and county to effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use and enhance stormwater systems and facilities in the City in concert with the management of other water resources in the City and county. In order to do so, the City and county must have adequate and stable funding for the stormwater management program, operating and capital investment needs. 
                  The Mayor and City Council find, conclude and determine that a utility provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering and funding stormwater management services in the City. 
                  An equitable approach to funding stormwater management services and facilities can be provided by adopting a schedule of service charges upon properties that is related to the burden of stormwater quality control service requirements and costs posed by properties throughout the City. Such schedule of service charges can be complemented by other funding methods which address specific needs including, but not limited to, allocations of special purpose local option sales taxes to stormwater drainage improvement projects. A service charge credit is an appropriate means of adjusting service charges in recognition that private stormwater systems and/or actions can effectively reduce or eliminate the burden of stormwater quantity and quality control service requirements and costs that a property or properties pose for the City. Impervious area is the most important factor influencing stormwater service requirements and costs posed by properties throughout the City, and therefore is an appropriate parameter for calculating stormwater service charges and associated credits. In addition, the value to the stormwater utility of certain actions and practices performed by property owners and other stormwater utility customers may be recognized by credits based on other factors including, but not limited to, the avoided cost of public information and education realized by the utility when public information and education about stormwater management is provided by the public school system. 
                  The "Feasibility Study for a Stormwater Utility User Fee" prepared by HDR/WL Jorden, Inc., CH2M HILL, Brown Design Associates, Inc. and CFA International, LLC properly assesses and defines the stormwater management problems, needs, goals, program priorities and funding opportunities for all of DeKalb County. 
                  Given the problems, needs, goals, program priorities and funding opportunities identified in the "Feasibility Study for a Stormwater Utility User Fee," it is appropriate to authorize the formation of an organizational and accounting entity dedicated specifically to the management, maintenance, protection, control, regulation, use and enhancement of stormwater systems in the City in concert with similar programs in DeKalb County. 
                  It would be advantageous for the City and DeKalb County to enter into an intergovernment agreement to effectively provide stormwater services and charge and collect reasonable fees for such services.

                  Sec. 6.5-122. - Establishment of a utility and enterprise fund. 
                  (a)  There is hereby established a stormwater management utility within the City which shall be responsible for stormwater management throughout the City's corporate limits, and shall provide for the management, protection, control, regulation, use, and enhancement of stormwater systems and facilities. Such utility shall be under the direction of the City Council. 
                  (b)  The City Council shall establish a stormwater enterprise fund in the City budget and accounting system, separate and apart from its general fund, for the purpose of dedicating and protecting all funding applicable to the purposes and responsibilities of the utility, including but not limited to rentals, rates, charges, fees, and licenses as may be established by the City Council. All revenues and receipts of the stormwater utility shall be deposited promptly upon receipt into the stormwater enterprise fund, to be held and invested in trust for the purposes dedicated, and expended exclusively for purposes of the utility, including capital project construction. No other funds of the City shall be deposited in the stormwater enterprise fund or commingled with dedicated stormwater revenues, except that other revenues, receipts, and resources not accounted for in the stormwater enterprise fund, including grants, loans, and bond proceeds may be combined with and applied to stormwater management capital projects as deemed appropriate by the City Council. 
                  (c)  The City Council hereby transfers to the stormwater utility director operational control over the existing stormwater management systems and facilities owned and heretofore operated by the City and county and other related assets, including but not limited to properties upon which such facilities are located, easements, rights-of-entry and access, and certain equipment. 
                  (Ord. No. 04-27, § 1, 12-6-04) 
                  Sec. 6.5-123. - Definitions. 
                  The following words, terms and phrases when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Credit means a conditional reduction in the amount of a stormwater service charge to an individual property based on the provision and continuing presence of an effectively maintained and operational on-site stormwater system or facility or the provision of a service or activity by the property owner, which system, facility, service, or activity reduces the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater services and facilities. Credits for on-site stormwater systems shall be generally proportional to the effect that such systems have on the peak rate of runoff from the site. 
                  Customer of the stormwater utility means all persons, properties, and entities served by and/or benefitting from the utility's acquisition, management, maintenance, extension, and improvement of the public stormwater management systems and facilities and regulation of public and private stormwater systems, facilities, and activities related thereto, and persons, properties, and entities which will ultimately be served or benefitted as a result of the stormwater management program. 
                  Detached dwelling unit means developed land containing one (1) structure which is not attached to another dwelling and which contains one (1) or more bedrooms, with a bathroom and kitchen facilities, designed for occupancy by one (1) family. Detached dwelling units may include houses, manufactured homes, and mobile homes located on one (1) or more individual lots or parcels of land. Developed land may be classified as a detached dwelling unit despite the presence of incidental structures associated with residential uses such as garages, carports or small storage buildings, or the presence of a commercial use within the dwelling unit so long as such use does not result in additional impervious areas such as parking spaces, playgrounds, or structures or additions to the building which are used as offices, storage facilities, meeting rooms, classrooms, houses of worship, or similar nonresidential uses. Detached dwelling unit shall not include developed land containing structures used primarily for nonresidential purposes, manufactured homes and mobile homes located within manufactured home or mobile home parks where the land is owned by others than the owners of the manufactured homes or mobile homes, or multiple dwelling unit residential properties. 
                  Developed land means property altered from its natural state by construction or installation of more than two hundred (200) square feet of impervious surface as defined in this article. 
                  Duplex and triplex means developed land containing two (2) (duplex) or three (3) (triplex) attached residential dwelling units located on one (1) or more parcels of land. 
                  Equivalent residential unit (ERU) of impervious area means the median average impervious coverage of detached dwelling unit properties in the City as determined by the City Council, and shall be used as the basis for determining stormwater service charges to detached dwelling unit properties or classes of detached dwelling unit properties and other properties. Three thousand (3,000) square feet of impervious area shall be one (1) equivalent unit. 
                  Hydrologic response means the manner and means whereby stormwater collects, remains, infiltrates, and is conveyed from a property. It is dependent on several factors including, but not limited to, the presence of impervious area, the size, shape, topographic, vegetative, and geologic conditions of a property, antecedent moisture conditions, and groundwater conditions on a property. 
                  Impervious surface means those areas which prevent or impede the infiltration of stormwater into the soil as it entered in natural conditions prior to development. Common impervious areas include, but are not limited to, rooftops, sidewalks, walkways, patio areas, driveways, parking lots, storage areas, compacted gravel and soil surfaces, awnings and other fabric or plastic coverings, and other surfaces which prevent or impede the natural infiltration of stormwater runoff which existed prior to development. 
                  Multiple dwelling unit residential properties means developed land whereon four (4) or more attached residential dwelling units are located and shall include, but are not limited to, apartment houses, condominiums, townhomes, attached single-family homes, boarding houses, group homes, hotels and motels, retirement centers, and other structures in which four (4) or more family groups commonly and normally reside or could reside. In the application of stormwater service charge rates, multiple dwelling unit properties shall be treated as other developed land. 
                  Other developed land means, but shall not be limited to, multiple dwelling unit residential properties, manufactured home and mobile home parks, commercial and office buildings, public buildings and structures, industrial and manufacturing buildings, storage buildings and storage areas covered with impervious surfaces, parking lots, parks, recreation properties, public and private schools and universities, research stations, hospitals and convalescent centers, airports, agricultural uses covered by impervious surfaces, water reservoirs, and water and wastewater treatment plants. 
                  Service charges means the periodic rate, fee, or charge applicable to a parcel of developed land, which charge shall be reflective of the service provided by the City stormwater utility. Service charges are based on measurable parameters which influence the stormwater utility's cost of providing services and facilities, with the most important factor being the amount of impervious area on each parcel of developed land. The use of impervious area as a service charge rate parameter shall not preclude the use of other parameters, or the grouping of properties having similar characteristics through the use of ranges or rounding up or down to a consistent numerical interval, or the use of flat-rate charges for one (1) or more classes of similarly-situated properties whose impact on the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and facilities is relatively consistent. Stormwater service charges may also include special charges to the owners of particular properties for services or facilities uniquely related to stormwater management of that property, including but not limited to charges for development plan review, inspection of development projects and on-site stormwater control systems, and enhanced levels of stormwater services above those normally provided by the City. 
                  Stormwater management systems means those systems which address the issues of drainage management (flooding) and environmental quality (pollution, erosion and sedimentation) of receiving rivers, streams, creeks, lakes, ponds, and reservoirs through improvements, maintenance, regulation and funding of plants, works, instrumentalities and properties used or useful in the collection, retention, detention, and treatment of stormwater or surface water drainage. 
                  Undeveloped land means land in its unaltered natural state or which has been modified to such minimal degree as to have a hydrologic response comparable to land in an unaltered natural state which shall be deemed undeveloped. Undeveloped land shall have no pavement, asphalt, or compacted gravel surfaces or structures which create an impervious surface that would prevent infiltration of stormwater or cause stormwater to collect, concentrate, or flow in a manner materially different than that which would occur if the land was in an unaltered natural state. For purposes of this article, undeveloped land shall also include property altered from its natural state by the creation or installation of less than two hundred (200) square feet of impervious surface. 
                  (Ord. No. 04-27, § 1, 12-6-04) 
                  Sec. 6.5-124. - Scope of responsibility for the drainage system in the City. 
                  (a)  The City drainage system consists of all rivers, streams, creeks, branches, lakes, reservoirs, ponds, drainageways, channels, ditches, swales, storm sewers, culverts, inlets, catch basins, pipes, head walls and other structures, natural or manmade, within the corporate boundaries of the City which control and/or convey stormwater through which the City intentionally diverts surface waters from its public streets and properties. The City or the county owns or has legal access for purposes of operation, maintenance and improvements to those segments of this system which (i) are located within public streets, rights-of-way, and easements; (ii) are subject to easements, rights-of-entry, rights-of-access, rights-of-use, or other permanent provisions for adequate access for operation, maintenance, and/or improvement of systems and facilities; or (iii) are located on public lands to which the City has adequate access for operation, maintenance, and/or improvement of systems and facilities. Operation and maintenance of stormwater systems and facilities which are located on private property or public property not owned by the City or county and for which there has been no public dedication of such systems and facilities shall be and remain the legal responsibility of the property owner, or its occupant, except as that responsibility may be otherwise affected by the laws of the state and the Unites States of America. 
                  (b)  It is the intent of this article to protect the public health, safety and general welfare of all properties and persons in general, but not to create any special duty or relationship with any individual person or to any specified property within or without the boundaries of the City. The City expressly reserves the right to assert all available immunities and defenses in any action seeking to impose monetary damages upon the City, its officers, employees and agents arising out of any alleged failure or breach of duty or relationship as may now exist or hereafter be created. To the extent any permit, plan approval, inspection or similar act is required by the City as a condition precedent to any activity by or upon property not owned by the City, pursuant to this or any other regulatory ordinance, regulation or rule of the City or under federal or state law, the issuance of such permit, plan approval, or inspection shall not be deemed to constitute a warranty, express or implied, nor shall afford the basis for any action, including any action based on failure to permit or negligent issuance of a permit, seeking the imposition of money damages against the City, its officers, employees or agents. 
                  (Ord. No. 04-27, § 1, 12-6-04) 
                  Sec. 6.5-125. - Requirements for on-site stormwater systems; enforcement methods and inspections. 
                  All property owners and developers of developed real property within the City shall provide, manage, maintain, and operate on-site stormwater systems sufficient to collect, convey, detain, and discharge stormwater in a safe manner consistent with all City development regulations and the laws of the state and the United States of America. Any failure to meet this obligation shall constitute a nuisance and be subject to an abatement action filed by the City in the Municipal Court. In the event a public nuisance is found by the court to exist, which the owner fails to properly abate within such reasonable time as allowed by the court, the City may enter upon the property and cause such work as is reasonably necessary to be performed, with the actual cost thereof assessed against the owner in the same manner as a tax levied against the property. From date of the filing of such action, the City shall have lien rights which may be perfected, after judgment, by filing a notice of lien on the general execution docket of the Superior Court of DeKalb County. The City shall have the right, pursuant to the authority of this article, for its designated officers and employees to enter upon private and public property owned by entities other than the City, upon reasonable notice to the owner thereof, to inspect the property and conduct surveys and engineering tests thereon in order to assure compliance.

                  Sec. 6.5-126. - Determination and modification of stormwater service charges. 
                  Stormwater service charges shall be determined and modified from time to time by resolution of the City Council. In setting or modifying such rates it shall be the objective of the City Council to establish rates, fees and charges that are fair and reasonable, reflect the value of stormwater management services and facilities to those properties who benefit therefrom and, which together with any other sources of revenue that may be made available to the stormwater utility, will be sufficient to meet the cost of budgeted programs, services and facilities.

                  Sec. 6.5-127. - Effective date of stormwater service charges. 
                  Stormwater service charges shall accrue beginning January 1, 2005, and shall be billed periodically thereafter to customers, except as specific exemptions and credits may apply. 
                  (Ord. No. 04-27, § 1, 12-6-04) 
                  Sec. 6.5-128. - Stormwater service charges. 
                  In order to recover the cost of providing stormwater services and facilities while fairly and reasonably apportioning the costs among developed properties throughout the City based on the use of stormwater services and facilities, the following stormwater rates shall apply: 
                  (1)  Stormwater service charge rate per equivalent residential unit (ERU) or increment thereof. The stormwater service charge per equivalent residential unit shall be four dollars ($4.00) per month or as amended by official action of the City Council. 
                  (2)  Single detached dwelling lots. All single detached dwelling lots shall be charged the rate applicable to one (1) equivalent residential unit. 
                  (3)  Multiple dwelling lots. All multiple dwelling lots shall be charged the rate applicable to one (1) equivalent residential unit times the number of dwelling units located on the multiple dwelling unit property times an adjustment factor that adjusts the ERU to equal the median impervious coverage of a statistical sampling of a single dwelling unit within a multiple dwelling lot in DeKalb County, which has been determined to be 0.5. 
                  (4)  Other developed land. All other developed lands shall be billed for one (1) equivalent residential unit for each three thousand (3,000) square feet of impervious surface or increment thereof on the property, rounded to the next highest tenth of an equivalent residential unit. 
                  (Ord. No. 04-27, § 1, 12-6-04) 
                  Sec. 6.5-129. - Exemptions and credits applicable to stormwater service charges. 
                  Except as provided in this section, no public or private property shall be exempt from stormwater utility service charges or receive a credit or offset against such service charges. No exception, credit, offset, or other reduction in stormwater service charges shall be granted based on the age, tax or economic status, race, or religion of the customer, or other condition unrelated to the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater services and facilities. 
                  Undeveloped land as defined in this article shall be exempt from stormwater service charges. 
                  Railroad rights-of-way (tracks) shall be exempt from stormwater service charges. However, railroad stations, maintenance buildings, or other developed land used for railroad purposes shall not be exempt from stormwater service charges. 
                  Developed land other than individual detached dwelling units, including but not limited to, multiple dwelling unit residential properties, manufactured home and mobile home parks, commercial and office buildings, public buildings and structures, industrial and manufacturing buildings, storage buildings and storage areas covered with impervious surfaces, parking lots, parks, recreation properties, public and private schools and universities, research stations, hospitals and convalescent centers, airports, agricultural uses covered by impervious surfaces, water reservoirs, and water and wastewater treatment plants may receive a stormwater service charge credit. The stormwater service charge credit shall be determined based on the technical requirements and standards contained in the Stormwater Utility Service Charge Credit Technical Manual. The stormwater service charge credit may be up to one hundred (100) percent of the service charge applicable to a property, and shall be proportional to the extent that on-site systems, facilities, services, and activities provided, operated, and maintained by the property owner reduce or mitigate the stormwater utility's cost of providing services and facilities. 
                  Groups of detached dwelling units represented by an incorporated homeowners association providing on-site systems, facilities, services, or activities which reduce or mitigate the stormwater utility's cost of providing services and facilities may receive a stormwater service charge credit. The stormwater service charge credit shall be determined based on the technical requirements and standards contained in the Stormwater Utility Service Charge Credit Technical Manual. The stormwater service charge credit available to groups of detached dwelling units may be up to one hundred (100) percent of the service charge applicable to the individual properties, and shall be proportional to the extent that on-site systems, facilities, services, and activities provided, operated, and maintained by the homeowner association reduce or mitigate the stormwater utility's cost of providing services and facilities. 
                  Any credit allowed against the service charge is conditioned on continuing provisions of the systems, facilities, services, and activities provided, operated, and maintained by the property owner or owners upon which the credit is based. A credit may be revoked by the City at any time for noncompliance.

                  Sec. 6.5-130. - Stormwater service charge billing, delinquencies, collections. 
                  (a)  A stormwater service charge bill may be sent through the United States mail or by alternative means, notifying the customer of the amount of the bill, the date the payment is due, and the date when past due. Failure to receive a bill is not justification for nonpayment. Regardless of the party to whom the bill is initially directed, the owner of each parcel of developed land, as shown from public land records of the county, shall be ultimately obligated to pay such fee. If a customer is underbilled or if no bill is sent for developed land, the City may backbill for a period of up to four (4) years, but shall not assess penalties for any delinquency. A one and one-half (1.5) percent late charge shall be billed based on the unpaid balance of any stormwater utility service charge that becomes delinquent. 
                  (b)  Suit for collection shall be commenced by the City in the court of the owner's residence; provided, however, if the owner is not a resident of this state, suit may be filed in the Superior Court of DeKalb County. No lien shall be imposed for delinquent collections unless a judgment is first obtained from a court of competent jurisdiction.

                  Sec. 6.5-131. - Stormwater utility service charges billed in common. 
                  The stormwater utility service charge may be billed on a common statement and collected along with City taxes or county taxes or both City and county taxes. 
                  (Ord. No. 04-27, § 1, 12-6-04) 
                  Sec. 6.5-132. - Appeals. 
                  Any customer who believes the provisions of this article have been applied in error may appeal in the following manner: 
                  (1)  An appeal must be filed in writing with the City Clerk. In the case of service charge appeals, the appeal shall include a survey prepared by a registered land surveyor or professional engineer containing information on the total property area, the impervious surface area, and any other features or conditions which influence the hydrologic response of the property to rainfall events. 
                  (2)  Using the information provided by the appellant, the stormwater utility director shall conduct a technical review of the conditions on the property and respond to the appeal in writing within thirty (30) days. 
                  (3)  In response to an appeal the stormwater utility director may adjust the stormwater service charge applicable to a property in conformance with the general purpose and intent of this article. 
                  (4)  A decision of the stormwater utility director which is adverse to an appellant may be further appealed to the City Council within thirty (30) days of receipt of notice of the adverse decision. Notice of the appeal shall be served on the City Council by the appellant, stating the grounds for the appeal. The City Council shall issue a written decision on the appeal within thirty (30) days. All decisions of the City Council shall be served on the appellant personally or by registered or certified mail, sent to the billing address of the appellant. 
                  (5)  All decisions by the City Council shall be final. 
                  (6)  The appeal process contained in this section shall be a condition precedent to an aggrieved customer seeking judicial relief. Any decision of the City Council may be reviewed upon application for writ of certiorari before the Superior Court of DeKalb County, filed within thirty (30) days of the date of service of the decision.

                  --- (1) --- 
                  Editor's note— Ord. No. 05-19, adopted July 5, 2005, added zoning provisions to be designated as the floodplain management/flood damage prevention plan. Inasmuch as section 3 of Ord. No. 05-19 repealed conflicting provisions, said ordinance has repealed ch. 8, which consisted of §§ 8-1—8-70, pertained to similar provisions and derived from Ord. No. 228, adopted Jan. 4, 1988, in its entirety.  Subsequently, Ord. No. 2008-18, § 1, adopted Sept. 25, 2008, repealed the former zoning provisions, §§ 23-2001—23-2008, and adopted the floodplain management/flood damage prevention plan as set out herein. 
                  Cross reference— Environment, ch. 6. 

                  Sec. 8-1. - Findings. 
                  It is hereby determined that: 
                  (1)  The flood hazard areas of the City of Doraville are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare. 
                  (2)  Flood hazard areas can serve important stormwater management, water quality, streambank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation, and ecological purposes when permanently protected and when greenspace areas are undisturbed. 
                  (3)  Effective floodplain management and flood hazard protection activities can (1) protect human life and health; (2) minimize damage to private property; (3) minimize damage to public facilities and infrastructure such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, street and bridges located in floodplains; and (4) minimize expenditures of public money for costly flood control projects associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public. 
                  (4)  Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a) have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore the City of Doraville, Georgia, established this set of floodplain management and flood hazard reduction policies for the purposes of regulating the use flood hazard areas. It is determined that the regulation of flood hazard areas and the prevention of flood damages is in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety, as well as to private and public property. 
                  (Ord. No. 2008-18, § 1, 9-25-08) 
                  Sec. 8-2. - General provisions. 
                  (a)  Purpose and intent. The purpose of this chapter is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in flood hazard areas, as well as to protect the beneficial uses of floodplain areas for water quality protection, streambank and stream corridor protection, wetlands preservation and ecological and environmental protection by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to flooding or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
                  (4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; 
                  (5)  Limit the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; and 
                  (6)  Protect the stormwater management, water quality, streambank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation and ecological functions of natural floodplain areas. 
                  (b)  Applicability. This chapter shall be applicable to all areas of special flood hazard within the City of Doraville, i.e., floodplain and floodprone areas as defined herein at or below the base flood elevation or the regulatory flood elevation, whichever is more restrictive (including A, AO, AH, AE, A1—30 or A-99 on the FIRM), and all new or substantial improvement residential units, all subdivisions, nonresidential structure, manufactured homes, recreational vehicles, and utilities located within these areas. In addition, all streams, with drainage areas of one hundred (100) acres or more have an area of special flood hazard. 
                  (c)  Designation of ordinance administrator. The City Manager or his designee is hereby appointed to administer and implement the provisions of this chapter. 
                  (d)  Basis for area of special flood hazard—Flood area maps and studies. For the purposes of this chapter, the following are adopted by reference: 
                  (1)  The flood insurance study (FIS), dated May 16, 2013, with accompanying maps and other supporting data and any revision thereto are hereby adopted by reference. For those land areas acquired by a municipality through annexation, the current effective FIS and data for DeKalb County are hereby adopted by reference. 
                  (2)  Other studies which may be relied upon for the establishment of the base flood elevation or delineation of the 100-year floodplain and floodprone areas include: 
                  a.  Any flood or flood-related study conducted by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the United States Geological Survey or any other local, State or Federal agency applicable to the City of Doraville; or 
                  b.  Any base flood study authored by a registered professional engineer in the State of Georgia which has been prepared by FEMA approved methodology and approved by City of Doraville. 
                  (3)  Other studies which may be relied upon for the establishment of the future-conditions flood elevation or delineation of the future-conditions floodplain and floodprone areas include: 
                  a.  Any flood or flood-related study conducted by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the United States Geological Survey, or any other local, state or federal agency applicable to the City of Doraville; or 
                  b.  Any future-conditions flood study authored by a registered professional engineer in the State of Georgia which has been prepared by FEMA approved methodology approved by City of Doraville. 
                  (4)  The repository for public inspection of the FIS, accompanying maps and other supporting data is located in the Doraville City Hall. 
                  (e)  Compatibility with other regulations. This chapter is not intended to modify or repeal any other ordinance, rule, regulation, statute, easement, covenant, deed restriction or other provision of law. The requirements of this chapter are in addition to the requirements of any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, and where any provision of this chapter imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, whichever provision is more restrictive or impose higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall control. 
                  (f)  Severability. If the provisions of any section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this chapter shall be adjudged invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such judgment shall not affect or invalidate the remainder of any section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this chapter. 
                  (g)  Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur; flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the City of Doraville or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.

                  (2)  Four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection; 
                  (3)  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and 
                  (4)  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
                  Site means the parcel of land being developed, or the portion thereof on which the development project is located. 
                  Start of construction means the date the permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (NOTE: Accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance requirements). For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
                  Subdivision means the division of a tract or parcel of land resulting in one (1) or more new lots or building sites for the purpose, whether immediately or in the future, of sale, other transfer of ownership or land development, and includes divisions of land resulting from or made in connection with the layout or development of a new street or roadway or a change in an existing street or roadway. 
                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
                  Substantial improvement means any combination of repairs, reconstruction, alteration, or improvements to a building, taking place during a ten-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure prior to the improvement. The market value of the building means (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage" regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include those improvements of a building required to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions, which have been pre-identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project. 
                  Substantially-improved existing manufactured home park or subdivision is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. 
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certificates, or other evidence of compliance required in this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  Sec. 8-5. - Standards for development. 
                  (a)  Definition of floodplain boundaries: 
                  (1)  Studied "A" zones, as identified in the FIS, shall be used to establish base flood elevations whenever available. 
                  (2)  For all streams with a drainage area of one hundred (100) acres or greater, the future-conditions flood elevations shall be provided by the City of Doraville. If future-conditions elevation data is not available from the City of Doraville, then it shall be determined by a registered professional engineer using a method approved by FEMA and the City of Doraville. 
                  (b)  Definition of floodway boundaries: 
                  (1)  The width of a floodway shall be determined from the FIS or FEMA-approved flood study. For all streams with a drainage area of one hundred (100) acres or greater, the regulatory floodway shall be provided by the City of Doraville. If floodway data is not available from the City of Doraville, then it shall be determined by a registered professional engineer using a method approved by FEMA and the City of Doraville. 
                  (c)  General standards: 
                  (1)  No development shall be allowed within the future-conditions floodplain that could result in any of the following: 
                  a.  Raising the base flood elevation or future-conditions flood elevation equal to or more than 0.01 foot; 
                  b.  Reducing the base flood or future-conditions flood storage capacity; 
                  c.  Changing the flow characteristics as to the depth and velocity of the waters of the base flood or future-conditions flood as they pass both the upstream and the downstream boundaries of the development area; or 
                  d.  Creating hazardous or erosion-producing velocities, or resulting in excessive sedimentation. 
                  (2)  Any development within the future-conditions floodplain allowed under [subsection] (1) above shall also meet the following conditions: 
                  a.  Compensation for storage capacity shall occur between the average ground water table elevation and the base flood elevation for the base flood, and between the average ground water table elevation and the future-condition flood elevation for the future-conditions flood, and lie either within the boundaries of ownership of the property being developed and shall be within the immediate vicinity of the location of the encroachment. Acceptable means of providing required compensation include lowering of natural ground elevations within the floodplain, or lowering of adjoining land areas to create additional floodplain storage. In no case shall any required compensation be provided via bottom storage or by excavating below the elevation of the top of the natural (pre-development) stream channel unless such excavation results from the widening or relocation of the stream channel; 
                  b.  Cut areas shall be stabilized and graded to a slope of no less than 2.0 percent; 
                  c.  Effective transitions shall be provided such that flow velocities occurring on both upstream and downstream properties are not increased or decreased; 
                  d.  Verification of no-rise conditions (0.01 foot or less), flood storage volumes, and flow characteristics shall be provided via a step-backwater analysis meeting the requirements of subsection 8-5(d); 
                  e.  Public utilities and facilities, such as water, sanitary sewer, gas, and electrical systems, shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate infiltration or contamination from floodwaters; and 
                  f.  Any significant physical changes to the base flood floodplain shall be submitted as a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) or conditional letter of map amendment (CLOMA), whichever is applicable. The CLOMR submittal shall be subject to approval by the City of Doraville using the community consent forms before forwarding the submittal package to FEMA for final approval. The responsibility for forwarding the CLOMR to FEMA and for obtaining the CLOMR approval shall be the responsibility of the applicant. Within six (6) months of the completion of construction, the applicant shall submit as-built surveys for a final Letter of map revision (LOMR). 
                  (d)  Engineering study requirements for floodplain encroachments. An engineering study is required, as appropriate to the proposed development activities on the site, whenever a development proposes to disturb any land within the future-conditions floodplain, except for a residential single-lot development on streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodways for which the provisions of subsection 2106(d) apply. This study shall be prepared by a currently registered professional engineer in the State of Georgia and made a part of the application for a permit. This information shall be submitted to and approved by the City of Doraville prior to the approval of any permit which would authorize the disturbance of land located within the future-conditions floodplain. Such study shall include: 
                  (1)  Description of the extent to which any watercourse or floodplain will be altered or relocated as a result of the proposed development; 
                  (2)  Step-backwater analysis, using a FEMA-approved methodology approved by the City of Doraville. Cross-sections (which may be supplemented by the applicant) and flow information will be obtained whenever available. Computations will be shown duplicating FIS results and will then be rerun with the proposed modifications to determine the new base flood profiles, and future-conditions flood profiles; 
                  (3)  Floodplain storage calculations based on cross-sections (at least one (1) every one hundred (100) feet) showing existing and proposed floodplain conditions to show that base flood floodplain and future-conditions floodplain storage capacity would not be diminished by the development; 
                  (4)  The study shall include a preliminary plat, grading plan, or site plan, as appropriate, which shall clearly define all future-conditions floodplain encroachments. 
                  (e)  Floodway encroachments. Located within areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, floodways must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore the following provisions shall apply: 
                  (1)  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway, except for activities specifically allowed in [subsection] (2) below. 
                  (2)  Encroachments for bridges, culverts, roadways and utilities within the regulatory floodway may be permitted provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase to the pre-project base flood elevations, floodway elevations, or floodway widths during the base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof; and 
                  (3)  If the applicant proposes to revise the floodway boundaries, no permit authorizing the encroachment into or an alteration of the floodway shall be issued by the City of Doraville until an affirmative conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) is issued by FEMA and no-rise certification is approved by the City of Doraville. 
                  (f)  Maintenance requirements. The property owner shall be responsible for continuing maintenance as may be needed within an altered or relocated portion of a floodplain on his property so that the flood-carrying or flood-storage capacity is not diminished. The City of Doraville may direct the property owner (at no cost to City of Doraville) to restore the flood-carrying or flood-storage capacity of the floodplain if the owner has not performed maintenance as required by the approved floodplain management plan on file with the City of Doraville. 
                  (Ord. No. 2008-18, § 1, 9-25-08) 
                  Sec. 8-6. - Provisions for flood damage reduction. 
                  (a)  General standards. In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  New construction of principal buildings (residential or nonresidential), including manufactured homes, shall not be allowed within the limits of the future-conditions floodplain, unless all requirements of subsections 8-5(c), 8-5(d) and 8-5(e) have been met;

The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater. 
                  a.  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
                  1.  Provide a minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
                  2.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot above grade; and 
                  3.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both directions. 
                  b.  So as not to violate the "lowest floor" criteria of this chapter, the unfinished and flood-resistant enclosure shall solely be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area; and 
                  c.  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms. 
                  (6)  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located three (3) feet above the base flood elevation or one (1) foot above the future-conditions flood elevation, whichever is higher, so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding; 
                  (7)  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces; 
                  (8)  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system; 
                  (9)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters; 
                  (10)  Onsite waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them, or contamination from them, during flooding; and 
                  (11)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure which is not compliant with the provisions of this chapter, shall be undertaken only if the nonconformity is not furthered, extended or replaced; 
                  (12)  If the proposed development is located in multiple flood zones or multiple base flood elevation cross the proposed site, the higher or more restrictive base flood elevation or future condition elevation and development standards shall take precedence. 
                  (b)  Building standards for structures and buildings within the future-conditions floodplain. The following provisions, in addition to those in subsection (a), shall apply: 
                  (1)  Residential buildings.

                  The following variance and appeals procedures shall apply to an applicant who has been denied a permit for a development activity or to an owner or developer who has not applied for a permit because it is clear that the proposed development activity would be inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter. A request for a variance may be submitted by an applicant who has been denied a permit by the City of Doraville or by an owner or developer who has not previously applied for a permit for the reasons stated herein above. 
                  (1)  Requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter shall be submitted to the City Council as established by the City of Doraville. All such requests shall be heard and decided in accordance with procedures to be published in writing by the City of Doraville. At a minimum, such procedures shall include notice to all affected parties and the opportunity to be heard. 
                  (2)  The City Council shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirements, decision, or determination is made by the City Manager or designee in the enforcement or administration of this chapter.

                  (5)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure, and the variance issued shall be the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (6)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this section are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (7)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (8)  In reviewing such requests, the City Council shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this chapter. 
                  (9)  Conditions for variances: 
                  a.  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  1.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
                  2.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  3.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, or creation of a nuisance, or cause fraud or victimization of the public. 
                  b.  The provisions of this chapter are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore, any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of a historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  c.  Any person to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  d.  The building official shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (10)  Any person requesting a variance shall, from the time of the request until the time the request is acted upon, submit such information and documentation as the City of Doraville and City Council shall deem necessary to the consideration of the request.

                  (2)  Withhold certificate of occupancy.

                  Sec. 10-51. - Purpose. 
                  Insofar as unsolicited handbills and flyers are constantly left on private premises and vehicles in public places, there is a problem with litter as such handbills are oftentimes blown into the streets and onto lawns and not retrieved. In addition to the litter problem created by handbill distribution, an accumulation of handbills is a signal to burglars or vandals that the residence is unoccupied. To that end, this article will set out guidelines for distribution of unsolicited handbills.

                  Unless inhabited private premises are posted with a notice prohibiting delivery of handbills, or unless requested by anyone upon such premises not to do so, the person distributing the handbills may place or deposit any such handbill in or upon such inhabited private premises, if such handbill is placed or deposited in a manner reasonably designed to secure or prevent such handbill from being blown or drifted about such premises or sidewalks, streets or other public places, and except that mailboxes may not be so used when prohibited by federal postal law or regulations.

Other circumstances which may be considered are a refusal to disperse when a group of more than two (2) persons are blocking public or private sidewalks or ways, obstructing or interfering with the ingress or egress to businesses, shopping centers, or other private ways, or other obstruction of the orderly flow of traffic, pedestrian, vehicular, or otherwise.

No person shall be convicted of an offense under this section if the law enforcement officer fails to comply with the foregoing procedure or if it appears at trial that the explanation given by the person was true and would have dispelled the alarm or immediate concern.

                  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Alarm system means any single device or assembly of equipment designed to signal the occurrence of an illegal entry or other activity requiring immediate attention and to which the police department is expected to respond, but does not include alarms installed in motor vehicles or fire alarms. 
                  Alarm signal means a detectable signal, either audible or visual, generated by an alarm system, to which the police are expected to respond. 
                  Alarm user means any individual, corporation, limited liability company, partnership, proprietorship, governmental or educational entity or any other entity owning or leasing an alarm system, or on whose premises an alarm system is maintained for the protection of such premises. 
                  Automatic dial protection device means an automatic dialing device or an automatic telephone dialing alarm system and shall include any system which upon being activated, automatically initiates to the Doraville Police Department, a recorded message or code signal indicating a need for police response. 
                  Chief of police means the chief of police of the Doraville Police Department or his designee. 
                  Improper alarm activation means the activation of an alarm system through mechanical or electronic failure, malfunction, improper installation, or the negligence of the alarm user, the alarm users employees or agents, and signals to summon police individual unless law enforcement response was canceled by the alarm user or the alarm users agent before police individual arrive at the alarm location. Improper alarm activation shall also mean activation of such alarm due to power failure when such power failure is not caused by fire, forced entry or attempted forced entry. An improper alarm activation shall not include an alarm which can reasonably be determined to have been caused or activated by unusually violent conditions of nature nor does it include other extraordinary circumstances not reasonably subject to control by the alarm user. In addition, an alarm activated during an alarm system testing procedure shall not be considered an improper alarm activation if the alarm user first notifies and receives permission from the user's alarm company, or designee, to test the system. An alarm activation is improper within the meaning of this article when, upon inspection by the chief of police or his designee, evidence indicates that no unauthorized entry, robbery, or other such crime was committed or attempted in or on the premises which would have activated a properly functioning alarm system.

                  Editor's note— Ord. No. 07-03, adopted May 21, 2007, enacted provisions to be designated as §§ 11-180—11-186. Inasmuch as there already exists §§ 11-180—11-183, said provisions have been redesignated as §§ 11-190—11-196. Original section designations have been maintained in the history notes following each section. 

                  Sec. 11-190. - Short title. 
                  This article shall be known and may be cited as the "Doraville Street Gang Terrorism and Prevention Ordinance." 
                  (Ord. No. 07-03, § 1(11-180), 5-21-07) 
                  Sec. 11-191. - Legislative intent. 
                  (a)  The Mayor and City Council find and declare that it is the right of every person to be secure and protected from fear, intimidation, and physical harm caused by the activities of violent groups and individuals. It is not the intent of this article to interfere with the exercise of the constitutionally protected rights of freedom of expression and association. The Mayor and City Council recognize the constitutional right of every citizen to harbor and express beliefs on any lawful subject whatsoever, to associate lawfully with others who share similar beliefs, to petition lawfully constituted authority for a redress of perceived grievances, and to participate in the electoral process. 
                  (b)  The Mayor and City Council, however, further find that the City of Doraville is in a state of crisis which has been caused by violent street gangs whose members threaten, terrorize, and commit a multitude of crimes against the peaceful citizens of their neighborhoods. These activities, both individually and collectively, present a clear and present danger to public order and safety and are not constitutionally protected. 
                  (c)  The Mayor and City Council find that there are criminal street gangs operating in the City and that the number of gang-related crimes is increasing. It is the intent of the Mayor and City Council in enacting this article to seek the eradication of criminal activity by street gangs by focusing upon patterns of criminal gang activity and upon the organized nature of street gangs which together are the chief source of terror created by street gangs. 
                  (d)  The Mayor and City Council further find that an effective means of punishing and deterring the criminal activities of street gangs is through forfeiture of the profits, proceeds, and instrumentalities acquired, accumulated, or used by street gangs.

                  Active park area, for purposes of this article only, means any City of Doraville recreational facility or section thereof that is characterized by formally designated athletic fields or outdoor courts (basketball, volleyball, tennis, etc.). The use of cleats is permitted on designated athletic fields. Active park areas are also characterized by specialized development and management which may include additional restrictions on use or scheduling. Examples of active recreational area uses include baseball, soccer, football and lacrosse. Any activity where the participants wear cleats is deemed to be an active park area only use. 
                  Passive park area, for purposes of this article only, means any City of Doraville recreational facility or section thereof that is dedicated for recreational activities that do not materially alter the landscape, degrade environmental quality, nor involve commercial recreational use. Recreational activities involving nine (9) or more people acting in concert or any activity where cleats are worn must be carried out in active park areas and are not permitted in passive park areas. Passive park areas are designed for uses such as viewing nature, horseshoes, walking, sitting and random play. Passive park areas are used for less structured activities which require little or no specialized land development or management.

                  (Ord. No. 205, § XI, 9-2-80) 
                  Sec. 13-13. - Same—Submission of plans for approval. 
                  (a)  A two-stage alarm system is required for each tank within the City receiving petroleum products from a pipeline transportation company. The high-level alarm shall serve as a warning. The high-level shutdown alarm will signal the pipeline transportation company to immediately shut down delivery to the tank. Both the high-level alarm and the high-level shutdown alarm must signal both the terminal operations and the pipeline operations delivery points. Audible outside alarms shall be established so that they can be heard anywhere on the premises of the company operating the storage tank. 
                  (b)  The equipment and methods of operation are required to be simple and high quality equipment. The National Electrical Code and the local and state electrical codes shall govern the electrical design. 
                  (c)  All equipment must be such as can be easily maintained and accessible. The following requirements must be provided and furnished to the pipelines: 
                  (1)  Interconnection of pipeline pumping control facilities and terminal tank facilities will utilize compatible systems and equipment. Systems and equipment will be subject to approval of the City engineer prior to the installation. 
                  (2)  Separate circuits are required for the two (2) types products delivered to the tanks, namely, gasoline and distillates, where simultaneous delivery of such products is possible. A single circuit may be used to each pipeline company that transmits the alarm signals, provided the two (2) types of alarms can be sent simultaneously. Any violation of this section, as amended, shall be subject to punishment as provided in section 1-12 of the Municipal Code of the City. 
                  (3)  Alarms shall be made only to the pipeline making a delivery. 
                  (4)  The pipelines shall not cancel any alarm received. Receiving terminals (shippers) shall be responsible for rectifying and thereby canceling any and all alarms. 
                  (5)  The high-level alarm shall be set so as to allow twelve (12) minutes from the time of the alarm until tank overflow at the maximum receiving rate. Unless notification to the contrary is given from the terminal operator to the pipeline, shutdown will be started two (2) minutes after the pipeline's receipt of the high-level alarm. 
                  (6)  The high-level shutdown alarm must be set to alarm five (5) minutes before the tank will overflow at the maximum receiving rate. Upon receipt of the high-level shutdown alarm the pipeline company shall immediately shut down its delivery of products to the terminal. 
                  (7)  Cancellation of the alarm signal from a terminal to a pipeline by the terminal operator must be made by closing a limit switch on the respective tank fill valve, or by reducing the level of product in the tank or tanks in the "alarm" condition. 
                  (8)  Upon receipt of a high-level shutdown alarm the terminal when pumping from one (1) tank to another will likewise shut down pumping to the tank in the alarm condition. 
                  (9)  Silencing of any stage audible alarm at a terminal annunciator shall not cancel the alarm to the pipeline. 
                  (10)  All systems shall be "fail safe" in that the alarm relay shall be energized at all times. An alarm condition will interrupt power from a terminal to a pipeline and sound an alarm. 
                  (11)  All alarm testing shall be confirmed in a written document maintained at each facility where such testing occurs and the same shall be open for review by the City of Doraville. To further support terminal alarm testing documentation, the terminals will be responsible for test alarm reconciliation between the individual terminals and pipelines and the same shall be noted in the permanent document maintained at the facility. The pipelines shall also send to each terminal test results weekly from alarm tests. 
                  (Ord. No. 205, § XII, 9-2-80; Ord. No. 99-8, § 1, 8-2-99; Ord. No. 01-7, § 2, 12-3-01) 
                  Sec. 13-14. - Same—Testing procedures. 
                  (a)  Each high-level alarm at each terminal shall be checked on a weekly basis, but in no event shall the interval between such tests exceed fourteen (14) days. Said tank alarm tests are to be performed at the tank. 
                  (b)  Each terminal and each pipeline company shall maintain a log which shows the results of the above required tests. The alarms shall be tested only on Wednesday from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. 
                  (c)  Each terminal must check each alarm on each tank to the annunciator panel and for the outside audible alarm. Each terminal with the cooperation of the pipeline transportation company shall check out all circuits between the pipeline and the terminal from a tank to the pipeline annunciator panel. All records shall be maintained in a bound ledger and shall be available for audit by an officer of the City or the county or state fire marshal. Each phase, i.e., the alarm itself, the outside audible alarm and the annunciator, will be shown on the records of the terminal. Each malfunction shall be recorded in such log, repaired and the date of the malfunction and the date of the repair noted therein. The pipeline company shall keep a log in substantially the same form as shown in Exhibit "A" and the terminals shall keep a log in the form shown in Exhibit "B".

Such procedure shall be conducted in a safe, prudent manner and shall be performed and accomplished so as to cause a minimum loss of any hazardous or combustible material. In the event any such hazardous or combustible material is spilled, it shall be retrieved or treated immediately. Should more than twenty-five (25) gallons of such material be spilled, the persons to be notified in the event of a spill, as set forth in section 13-6, shall be notified, and such an event will be deemed a violation of this chapter. 
                  (Ord. No. 205, § XVII, 9-2-80)

                  Sec. 14-0. - Purpose and findings. 
                  (a)  The Mayor and Council find that signs provide an important medium through which individuals may convey a variety of messages. However, left completely unregulated, signs can become a threat to public safety as a traffic hazard and detriment to property values and the City's overall public welfare as an aesthetic nuisance. 
                  (b)  Various and diverse businesses are located within the City of Doraville. The need to advertise products and services must be balanced by the City's obligation to restrict clutter, maintain an aesthetically pleasing environment, protect property values, and enhance public safety. 
                  (c)  Regulation of the location, size, placement, and certain features of signs is necessary to enable the public to locate goods, services, and facilities in the City without difficulty and confusion, to improve the general attractiveness of the community, to take advantage of the beauty of the community's natural environment, and to protect values therein. Such regulation is also necessary to facilitate and aid in the identification and location of businesses in the City in the event of police, fire or other emergencies and to avoid confusion and delay in response to such emergencies. 
                  (d)  By enacting this chapter, the Mayor and Council intend to: 
                  (1)  Balance the rights of individuals to convey their messages through signs and the right of the public to be protected against the unrestricted proliferation of signs. 
                  (2)  Promote and protect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (3)  Enhance the economy and the business and industry of the City by promoting the reasonable, orderly and effective display of signs. 
                  (4)  Restrict signs and lights which increase traffic and pedestrian hazards. 
                  (5)  Promote signs which are compatible with their surroundings. 
                  (6)  Ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign regulations. 
                  (e)  As these or any regulations can only establish the mechanical limits of signs and not enforce a level of visual quality in sign design, any person planning a sign is strongly encouraged to consider: 
                  (1)  The character of the proposed sign and the audience for which the sign is to be designed. The applicant is urged to think not only of the sign in and of itself bus also in terms of the effects such a sign will have upon the character of the surrounding area. 
                  (2)  The character of the sign structure, that is, the physical means of supporting the sign, and whether that structure could be made an integral part of the sign rather than a separate and frequently distracting element. 
                  (f)  Any person contemplating a sign is also encouraged to contact the City Inspector or a private firm or individual engaged in sign/graphic design for advice or assistance in the planning of such sign. 
                  (g)  It is also the purpose of this chapter to insure proper maintenance, for safety and structural soundness, as well as the appearance and attractiveness of signs.

                  Sec. 14-5. - Denial and revocation. 
                  (a)  Procedure. Permits shall be denied where the applications for signs do not comply with the provisions of this chapter, are incomplete, and where the applications contain any false material statements. Violation of any provision of this chapter and any other applicable state laws or city ordinances governing signs will be grounds for revoking a permit granted by the City for the erection of a sign. Should it be determined that a sign permit was issued pursuant to an incomplete application or an application containing a false material statement, or that a permit has been erroneously issued in violation of this chapter, the Planning Director shall revoke the permit. Should the Director deny a permit, the reasons for the denial are to be stated in writing and hand delivered, mailed by certified mail, emailed, or faxed to the address on the permit application, on or before the fifteenth business day after the Director's receipt of the application. Any application denied and later resubmitted shall be deemed to have been submitted on the date of resubmission instead of the date of the original submission. No permit shall be denied or revoked except for due cause as hereinafter defined. "Due cause" is the violation of the provisions of this chapter, other applicable ordinances, state or federal law, or the submission of an incomplete application or an application containing false material statements. 
                  (b)  Appeals. The City Council shall have the power and duty to hear and decide appeals where it is alleged that there is an error in the denial or revocation of a sign permit under this chapter. All such appeals shall be heard and decided following the same notice requirements as for variance applications under this chapter, and pursuant to the following criteria and procedural requirements: 
                  (1)  Appeal of decision by administrative officials. A denial pursuant to this chapter shall be appealable by filing with the Planning Director an application for appeal on the forms provided by the Planning Department specifying the grounds thereof, within fifteen (15) days after the action appealed from was taken. The application fee for an appeal under this section shall be the same as that established for appeals under the Zoning Ordinance. 
                  (2)  Decision of the Council. Following the consideration of all testimony, documentary evidence, and matters of record, the Council shall make a determination on each appeal. An appeal shall be sustained only upon an expressed finding by the Council that the administrative official's action was based on an erroneous finding of a material fact, or that the administrative official acted in an arbitrary manner. In exercising its powers, the Council may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or determination appealed from, and to that end shall have all the powers of the administrative official from whom the appeal was taken and may issue or direct the issuance of a permit provided all requirements imposed by all other applicable laws are met. 
                  (3)  Time for final decision. A final decision will be rendered by the Council within ninety (90) days from date an appeal is filed. If a final decision is not rendered within the ninety-day period, the decision sought to be appealed shall be reversed. 
                  (c)  Certiorari. In the event a person whose permit has been denied or revoked is dissatisfied with the decision of the Council, a person may petition for writ of certiorari to the Superior Court of DeKalb County as provided by law.

No refunds will be made for permit fees paid for permits that expired due to failure to erect a permitted sign. If later an individual desires to erect a sign at the same location, a new application must be processed and another fee paid in accordance with the fee schedule applicable at such time.

                  Sec. 16-34. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices. 
                  (a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the article and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this chapter shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections 16-34(b) and (c) of this article. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit. 
                  (b)  Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
                  (1)  Best management practices as set forth in subsections 16-34(b) and (c) of this article shall be required for all land-disturbing activities.

As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in [O.C.G.A.] § 12-7-6(b). 
                  (2)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than twenty-five (25) nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten (10) nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five (5) acres. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such failure occurs.

                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regarding and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practical erosion potential; 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  (7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection 16-34(b)(2) of this article; 
                  (15)  Except as provided in paragraph (16) of this subsection, there is established a twenty-five-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream: That under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the groundwater table year-round; for which groundwater is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow, Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least twenty-five (25) feet established pursuant to Part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within twenty-five (25) degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than fifty (50) feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines. 
                  (16)  There is established a fifty-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of tenty-five (25) gallons per minute or less shall have a twenty-five-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within twenty-five (25) degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than fifty (50) feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines. 
                  (d)  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq., shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections 16-34(b) and (c) of this article. 
                  (e)  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this chapter or the terms of the permit.

The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
                  (b)  Application requirements. 
                  (1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the City of Doraville without first obtaining a permit from the City of Doraville to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
                  (2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the City of Doraville and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection 16-35(c) of this article. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of subsections 16-34(b) and (c) of this article will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by seven (7) copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-10. 
                  (3)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed eighty dollars ($80.00) per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  (4)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within thirty-five (35) days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within thirty-five (35) days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by subsections 16-34(c)(15) and (16) has been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per subsections 16-35(b) and (c) have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within thirty-five (35) days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within thirty-five (35) days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
                  (5)  If a permit applicant has had two (2) or more violations of previous permits, this section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three (3) years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
                  (6)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, three thousand dollars ($3,000.00) per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  (c)  Plan requirements. 
                  (1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in subsections 16-34(b) and (c) of this article, or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" is hereby incorporated by reference into this chapter. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and stormwater management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
                  (2)  Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
                  (d)  Permits. 
                  (1)  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than forty-five (45) days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
                  (2)  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this chapter, any variances required by subsections 16-34(c)(15) and (16) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per subsection 16-35(b)(6) are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
                  (3)  Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this chapter, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
                  (4)  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
                  (5)  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this chapter. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
                  (6)  The LIA may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two (2) or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three (3) years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(f)(1). 
                  (Ord. No. 2010-14, § 1, 5-17-10) 
                  Sec. 16-36. - Inspection and enforcement. 
                  (a)  The City of Doraville and/or the DeKalb County Development Department will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this chapter, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this chapter. 
                  (b)  The local issuing authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within twelve (12) months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975. 
                  (c)  The City of Doraville and/or the DeKalb County Development Department shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this article, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities. 
                  (d)  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
                  (e)  The districts or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). The districts or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
                  (f)  The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have ninety (90) days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within ninety (90) days after notification by the division, the division shall revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority.

                  Sec. 16-37. - Penalties and incentives. 
                  (a)  Failure to obtain a permit for land-disturbing activity. If any person commences and land-disturbing activity requiring a land-disturbing permit as prescribed in this chapter without first obtaining said permit, the person shall be subject to revocation of his business license, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a business and associated work activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. 
                  (b)  Stop-work orders. 
                  (1)  For the first and second violations of the provisions of this chapter, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have five (5) days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within five (5) days, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a stop-work order requiring that land-disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided, however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land-disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order in lieu of a warning. 
                  (2)  For a third and each subsequent violation, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order; 
                  (3)  All stop-work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. 
                  (4)  When a violation in the form of taking action without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer, or significant amounts of sediment, as determined by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee, have been or are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained, a stop-work order shall be issued by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee. All such stop-work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop work orders shall apply to all land-disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls. 
                  (c)  Bond forfeiture. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities has failed to comply with the approved plan, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this chapter and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to have forfeited his performance bond, if required to post one under the provisions of subsection 16-35(b)(6). The local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. 
                  (d)  Monetary penalties. Any person who violates any provisions of this chapter, or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant to this chapter, or who negligently or intentionally fails or refuses to comply with any final or emergency order of the director issued as provided in this chapter shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) per day. For the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this article, notwithstanding any provisions in any City Charter to the contrary, municipal courts shall be authorized to impose penalty not to exceed two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) for each violation pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-15. Notwithstanding any limitation of law as to penalties which can be assessed for violations of county ordinances, any magistrate court or any other court of competent jurisdiction trying cases brought as violations of this article under county ordinances approved under this article shall be authorized to impose penalties for such violations not to exceed two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) for each violation pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-15. Each day during which violation or failure or refusal to comply continues shall be a separate violation.

                  Sec. 16-38. - Education and certification. 
                  (a)  Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspection or any land-disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on their level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
                  (b)  For each site on which land-disturbing activity occurs, each entity or person acting as either a primary, secondary, or tertiary permittee, as defined in the state general permit, shall have as a minimum one (1) person who is in responsible charge of erosion and sedimentation control activities on behalf of said entity or person and meets the applicable education or training certification requirements developed by the commission present on site whenever land-disturbing activities are conducted on that site. A project site shall herein be defined as any land-disturbance site or multiple sites within a larger common plan of development or sale permitted by an owner or operator for compliance with the state general permit. 
                  (c)  Persons or entities involved in projects not requiring a state general permit but otherwise requiring certified personnel on site may contract with certified persons to meet the requirements of this chapter. 
                  (d)  If a state general permittee who has operational control of land-disturbing activities for a site has met the certification requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-19(b)(1), then any person or entity involved in land-disturbing activity at that site and operating in a subcontractor capacity for such permittee shall meet those educational requirements specified in O.C.G.A. 12-7-19(b)(4) and shall not be required to meet any educational requirements that exceed those specified in said paragraph.

                  Sec. 16-39. - Administrative appeal, judicial review. 
                  (a)  Administrative remedies. The suspension, revocation, modification or grant with condition of a permit by the local issuing authority upon finding that the holder is not in compliance with the approved erosion, sediment and pollution control plan; or that the holder is in violation of permit conditions; or that the holder is in violation of any ordinance; shall entitle the person submitting the plan or holding the permit to a hearing before the City Council within thirty (30) days after receipt by the local issuing authority of written notice of appeal. 
                  (b)  Judicial review. Any person, aggrieved by a decision or order of the local issuing authority, after exhausting his administrative remedies, shall have the right to appeal denovo to the Superior Court of DeKalb County.

                  (c)  Liability. 
                  (1)  Neither the approval of a plan under the provisions of this article, nor the compliance with provisions of this article shall relieve any person from the responsibility for damage to any person or property otherwise imposed by law nor impose any liability upon the local issuing authority or district for damage to any person or property. 
                  (2)  The fact that a land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
                  (3)  No provision of this article shall permit any persons to violate the Georgia Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act or the rules and regulations promulgated and approved thereunder or pollute any waters of the state as defined thereby.

The subdivision name, date and book and page number of the original recording shall be noted on the new plat. 
                  The revised plat shall be filed with the City Planner for transmittal to the county subdivision administrator, who shall forward such plat to the proper county departments that would be involved in checking and certifying the revision. 
                  Upon receipt of certification by the proper authorities in the various county departments involved, the revised plat shall be referred to the City Planner for submission to the Planning Commission for approval or disapproval and to the City Council for review and concurrence. 
                  Upon receiving approval from the Planning Commission and concurrence from the City Council, the revised plat shall be submitted to the chairman of the county board of commissioners of roads and revenues for certification. 
                  The approved revised plat will be recorded by the county subdivision administrator and returned to the City Planner and the developer. 
                  Any revised plat that does not receive approval shall be returned to the developer with written notification stating reason for denial attached thereto.

                  ARTICLE V. - NONCONFORMING USES 
                  Within the zoning districts established by this chapter or amendments that may later be adopted there exist lots, structures and uses of structure and premises in combination which were lawful before this chapter was adopted or amended but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this chapter or future amendment. It is the intent of this chapter to permit these nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival. It is further the intent of this chapter that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district. 
                  Nonconforming uses are declared by this chapter to be incompatible with permitted uses in the districts involved. A nonconforming use of a structure, a nonconforming use of land, or a nonconforming use of structure and premises in combination shall not be extended or enlarged after passage of this chapter. 
                  To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction, or designated use of any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption of this chapter. Actual construction is hereby defined to include the placing of construction materials in permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner. Where excavation or demolition or removal of an existing building has been substantially began preparatory to rebuilding, such as excavation or demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction. 

                  Sec. 23-501. - Nonconforming lots of record. 
                  In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, a single-family dwelling and customary accessory building may be erected on any single lot of record at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter, not withstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this chapter. Such lot must be in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership. This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, that are generally applicable in the district, provided that yard dimensions and requirements other than these applying to area or width, or both, of the lots shall conform to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located. Variance of yard requirements shall be obtained only through action of the City Council. 
                  If two (2) or more lots or combinations of lots and portions of lots with continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at the time of passage or amendment of this chapter, and if all or part of the lots do not meet the requirements established for lot width and area, the lands involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the purposes of this chapter, and no portion of said parcel shall be used or sold in a manner which diminishes compliance with lot width and area requirements established by this chapter, nor shall any division of any parcel be made which creates a lot with width or area below the requirements stated in this chapter. 
                  Sec. 23-502. - Nonconforming uses of land (or land with minor structures only). 
                  Where at the time of passage of this chapter lawful use of land exists which would not be permitted by the regulations imposed by this chapter, and where such use involves no individual structure with a replacement cost exceeding one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), the use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, provided: 
                  (1)  No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter. 
                  (2)  No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such use at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter; 
                  (3)  If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a period of more than one hundred eighty (180) days, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the regulations specified by this chapter for the district in which such land is located. 
                  (4)  No additional structure not conforming to the requirements of this chapter shall be erected in connection with such nonconforming use of land. 
                  (Ord. No. 2014-06. § 2, 3-17-14) 
                  Sec. 23-503. - Nonconforming structures. 
                  Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter that could not be built under the terms of this chapter due to restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, its location on the lot, or other requirements concerning the structure, such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
                  (1)  No such nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be altered to decrease its nonconformity. 
                  (2)  Should such nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of more than sixty (60) percent of its replacement cost at time of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. 
                  (3)  Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located after it is moved. 
                  Sec. 23-504. - Nonconforming uses of structures or of structures and premises in combination. 
                  If lawful use involving individual structures with a replacement cost of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or more, or a structure and premises in combination, exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains lawful subject to the following provisions: 
                  (1)  No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this chapter in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered except in changing the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located; 
                  (2)  Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption or amendment of this chapter, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building; 
                  (3)  If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises, may be changed to another nonconforming use provided that the City Council, either by general rule or by making findings in the specific case, shall find that the proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the existing nonconforming use. In permitting such change, the City Council may require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accord with the provisions of this chapter; 
                  (4)  Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed; 
                  (5)  When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises in combination, is discontinued or abandoned for six (6) months (except when government action impedes access to the premises), the structure, or structure and premises in combination, shall not thereafter be used except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located; 
                  (6)  Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and premises in combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the nonconforming status of the land. Destruction for the purpose of this subsection is defined as damage to an extent of more than sixty (60) percent of the replacement cost at time of destruction. 
                  (7)  Structures incurring damage of less than sixty (60) percent of fair market value above the foundation may be restored, reconstructed and used as before, provided that such restoration is commenced within six (6) calendar months from the date damages were incurred. If reconstruction is not commenced within six (6) months, the use of said land or structure shall thereafter conform to the provisions of this chapter. Fair market value shall be determined by reference to current statutory provisions pertaining to real estate assessment and the records of the county assessor. 
                  (8)  If a structure or premises is being used (or a legally nonconforming commercial use under the current zoning regulations, which requires a valid occupation tax certificate to operate, failure of said business to renew its previously valid occupation tax certificate, or otherwise operate without a valid occupation tax certificate (or a period of six (6) months or more shall constitute per se abandonment of said non-conforming use and any right to continue said business as a legal non-conforming use is thereby extinguished.

                  Sec. 23-505. - Repairs and maintenance. 
                  On any nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a nonconforming use, work may be done in any period of twelve (12) consecutive months on ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing, to an extent not exceeding ten (10) percent of the current replacement cost of the nonconforming portion of the structure as the case may be, provided that the cubic content existing when it became nonconforming shall not be increased. 
                  If a nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a nonconforming use becomes physically unsafe or unlawful due to lack of repairs and maintenance, and is declared by any duly authorized official to be unlawful by reason of physical condition, it shall not thereafter be restored, repaired, or rebuilt except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located. 
                  Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any vacant, nonconforming structure or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of such official.

                  ARTICLE VI. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 

                  Sec. 23-601. - Accessory uses or structures. 
                  Accessory uses, structures, or buildings (other than location exclusions defined herein) shall only be permitted in rear yards, and except as otherwise may be provided within the zoning chapter. Accessory structures shall not be located on a street abutting side yard (which may also be referred to as a front yard and/or front yard building setback). On a street abutting side yard, the leading edge of the principal structure or the front building setback, whichever is greater, shall be indicative of a prohibited location within a front yard. No attempt has been made to classify the total number of types of accessory structures unless as set forth herein. 
                  Fences are regulated as accessory structures by virtue of section 23-703 and generally are permissible within front, side, and rear yards. 
                  Commercial, industrial, office and multiple-family applications (three (3) or more attached dwelling units) other than single-family detached residential and duplex (R-2) districts may have dumpster enclosures which meet City codes within rear and side yards although locations in rear yards are preferable. See also the City of Doraville Dumpster Ordinance for additional regulatory information (see chapter 15, article VI, dumpsters). 
                  No accessory building or structure shall be erected on a lot prior to the time of construction of the principal building to which it is subordinate but an accessory building or structure may be constructed at the same time as the principal structure. However, the accessory structure or building shall not receive a certificate of completion or certificate of occupancy (as applicable) until such time as the principal structure has received its certificate of occupancy. 
                  Within a residential district (R-1 and R-2), no accessory building shall ever become the principal structure. 
                  No accessory structure shall contain a dwelling unit, sleeping unit, living quarters or space for rent. 
                  No accessory structure shall be used for agricultural purposes or the keeping of animals other than household pets (as shall be subject to limitations of Code).

                  Accessory uses or structure shall only be permitted if they meet the following: 
                  (1)  Unless as provided by conditional use or otherwise precluded by a zoning district, only three (3) accessory buildings or structures shall be permitted on a lot (except dumpster enclosures as detailed herein) and as shall be regulated by the zoning district's dimensional requirements. The following items are exempt from calculation as an accessory structure within a single-family detached (R-1) zoning district; however, their locations and distance requirements shall still be in accordance with the zoning code unless as otherwise noted. 
                  NOTE: The annotation "front," "side," or "rear" means that not only shall this type of accessory structure fall within an exemption which shall not contribute to the total number of accessory structures allowed on a lot, but also these accessory items may be located within a "front yard," "side yard," or "rear yard" generally (subject to dimensional requirements of the zoned district and section 23-601) when they are not an exemption to total number of accessory structures (e.g., when they are larger than the maximum dimensional size and area allowed).

Accessory structures within these districts containing three (3) or more attached dwelling units shall be collectively provided and constructed simultaneous, but not thereafter, to the dwelling construction based on a City-approved master site plan. 
                  (4)  When an accessory use is attached to the principal structure by a breezeway, passage way or similar covered roofed means, it shall comply with the dimensional requirements of the principal structure to which it is accessory. A fence or wall shall not constitute attachment thereby eliminating the subordinate nature and distance requirements of the accessory structure. 
                  (5)  Accessory buildings or structures located on nonresidential zoned lots shall not be generally restricted as to overall square footage size provided the same are in compliance with the other requirements contained herein and the relevant zoning district's dimensional requirements. As defined herein, these nonresidential districts shall be C-1, C-2, O-I, O-W, M-1, M-2, R-3, R-4, and R-SFA districts.

                  (6)  Except as otherwise provided, no accessory building or structure shall be located closer than twenty (20) feet to any principal or other structure (excluding fences). In nonresidential districts (C-1, C-2, O-I, O-W, M-1, M-2, R-3, R-4, and RSFA), the building codes shall prevail which may mandate a larger distance requirement. No administrative variance shall be permitted for distance from other structure(s). 
                  (7)  The height of any accessory structure shall not exceed the zoning district dimensional requirements; however, any accessory structure in a residential district which exceeds one (1) story shall be required to obtain a conditional use permit when its height is taller than the principal structure to which it is subordinate. No administrative variance shall be permitted for accessory structure height. See also section 23-701, height exemptions, general rule, for other exceptions and regulated accessory items. 
                  (8)  Accessory buildings or structures shall not be used for any type of commercial operation whether permanent, temporary or as part of a home occupation in the R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4, RCH, and R-SFA districts. 
                  (9)  Portable, demountable, mobile, modular, manufactured or temporary accessory structures shall be prohibited in all zoning districts. See also section 23-606 regarding buildings on approved construction sites. No tractor trailer or other commercial vehicle shall be considered to be an accessory structure. No recreational vehicle shall be considered to be an accessory structure. No marine storage or shipping container shall be considered to be an accessory structure. No billboard sign shall be considered to be an accessory structure; but, its height shall be further regulated by the City sign code. 
                  (10)  Accessory structures must be anchored to permanent foundations which are either concrete slab on grade or a continuous footing or any combination thereof deemed acceptable by the City Building Official or his designee. Accessory structures may not, regardless of size, sit on the ground on runners, sit on blocks, or sit on piers. Any wood framing material less than eighteen (18) inches from grade shall be of decay-resistant material or pressure-treated wood. 
                  (11)  Except as otherwise provided for by Code, accessory structures shall be designed to be architecturally compatible with the principal structure to which they are accessory by the use of one (1) or more of the facade elevation materials found on the principal structure or determined to be complimentary thereto. Said design must be approved by the City Planner or his designee. Garages and carports have specific criteria which are further described in section 23-402, Definitions. The establishment of a City architectural control ordinance and/or board shall preempt the City Planner's review capacity; however, the City does not enforce protective covenants which are the responsibility of property owners. 
                  (12)  Accessory structures are not exempt from the City's floodplain and stream buffer ordinances unless as detailed therein.

                  (1)  Purpose: Goals: The purpose of this chapter is to establish guidelines for the sitting of towers and antennas. The goals of this chapter are to: (i) encourage the location of towers in nonresidential areas and minimize the total number of towers throughout the community, (ii) encourage strongly the joint use of new and existing tower sites, (iii) encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them, to the extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the community is minimal, (iv) encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a way that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers and antennas, and (v) enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services to provide such services to the community quickly, effectively, and efficiently. 
                  (2)  Principal or accessory use: Antennas and towers may be considered either principal or accessory uses. A different existing use or an existing structure on the small lot shall not preclude the installation of an antenna or tower on such lot. For purposes of determining whether the installation of a tower or antenna complies with district development regulations including, but not limited to, set-back requirements, lot-coverage requirements, and other such requirements, the dimensions of the entire lot shall control, even though the antennas or towers may be located on leased parcels within such lots. Towers that are constructed and antennas that are installed, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, shall not be deemed to constitute the expansion of a nonconforming use or structure. The lot upon which antennas and towers shall be is a lot which contains not less than five hundred (500) square feet and the same shall be fenced or otherwise secured in a manner acceptable to the Mayor and Council. 
                  (3)  Inventory of existing sites: Each applicant for an antenna, including small cell technology, and/or cell tower shall provide to the Mayor and Council an inventory of its existing towers that are either within the jurisdiction of the governing authority or within one-quarter-mile of the border thereof, including specific information about the location, height, and design of each tower. The Mayor and Council may share such information with other applicants applying for administrative approvals or variances or special use permits under this article or other organizations seeking to locate antennas within the jurisdiction of the governing authority, provided however, that the Mayor and Council is not, by sharing such information, in any way representing or warranting that such sites are available or suitable. 
                  (4)  Aesthetics and lighting: The guidelines set forth in this subsection shall govern the location of all towers, and the installation of all antennas, governed by this chapter; provided, however, that the governing authority may waive the requirements if it determines that the goals of this ordinance are better served thereby: 
                  a.  Towers shall either remain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standard of the FAA, be painted a neutral color, so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness. 
                  b.  At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and built environment. 
                  c.  If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible. 
                  d.  Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the governing authority may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views. 
                  (5)  Federal requirements: All towers must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed, to provide for new standards of safety or design geared towards increasing safety, then the owners of the towers and antennas governed by this article shall bring such towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six (6) months of the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a more stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal agency, and so long as this requirement does not conflict with the provisions of the new standards and regulations. Failure to bring towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall constitute a violation of this article and grounds for enforcement of this section by all available means as authorized under federal, state or local law. 
                  (6)  Building codes: Safety standards: To ensure the structural integrity of cell towers, the owner of a cell tower shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes and the applicable standards for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries Association, as amended from time to time. If upon inspection, the governing authority concludes that a cell tower fails to comply with such codes and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to the owner of the tower, the owner shall have thirty (30) days to bring such tower into compliance with such standards. If the owner fails to bring such tower into compliance within said thirty (30) days, the governing authority shall enforce this subsection by all available means as authorized by federal, state or local law. 
                  (7)  Distance restrictions: With the exception of small cell technology wireless support structures in the right-of-way, no cell tower shall be located closer than six hundred twenty-five (625) feet from any other cell tower as measured by a straight line between the two (2) structures. 
                  (8)  Application submittals: Applications for administrative permit, administrative variance or special use permit in accordance with this section shall include, but not be limited to:

                  Purpose. The (CT) commercial transition district is intended for parcels that have existing roll-up doors. The district provides a mixture of commercial, office, light industrial, and office warehouse style uses while allowing flexibility in their assemblage and configuration. Parcels must be three (3) acres or less in size. 
                  The permitted locations for inclusion within this district are the properties meeting the criterion herein which are located within the block of parcels which front New Peachtree/Shallowford Roads/Buford Highway and Church Drive/Stewart Road/New Peachtree Road as identified on the supplementary map attached hereto labeled as Exhibit "A." All references to street names are based on the names assigned to the streets referenced on date of the adoption of this district or as such streets may be renamed in the future but which remain at the same location as those existing on upon the adoption of this district. 
                  The existing parcel must be zoned C-2 (general business district) or O-1 (office institutional district) at the time of application for the commercial transition district. 
                  Split zoning within this district is possible where a frontage portion of the parcel fronts either New Peachtree Road or Shallowford Road and remains a C-2 (general business district) or O-1 (office institutional district) designation and the remainder of the property carries the commercial transition (CT) designation. Split zoning of properties fronting Buford Highway shall not be permitted. Applicants for split zoning shall be required to provide as-built surveys with a delineated zoning line and legal description(s) for each zoned portion of the site and the parent tract being split zoned.

                  ARTICLE X. - AIRPORT ZONING PROVISIONS 

                  Sec. 23-1001. - Purpose. 
                  The location of the DeKalb Peachtree Airport proximate to the City of Doraville necessitates restriction on the height of structures and trees and establishment of certain use restrictions within the airport's instrument approach and transitional zones. 
                  Sec. 23-1002. - Definitions. 
                  In addition to definitions previously included as part of this article, the following definitions are provided to clarify provisions relating to airport zones. 
                  (1)  Airport: The DeKalb Peachtree Airport. 
                  (2)  Airport hazard: Any structure, tree or use of land which obstructs the air space required for, or is otherwise hazardous to, the flight of aircraft in landing or taking off at the airport. 
                  (3)  Height: For the purpose of determining the height limits in all districts set forth in this article and shown on the official zoning map, the datum shall be mean sea level elevation. 
                  (4)  Nonconforming vegetation means any pre-existing vegetation, shrub, tree, or natural growth which is inconsistent with the provisions of this article. 
                  (5)  Structure means an object constructed or installed by man including, but without limitation, buildings, towers, smokestacks, and overhead transmission lines. 
                  (6)  Tree means any object of natural growth. 
                  Sec. 23-1003. - Airport zones. 
                  In order to carry out the provisions of this article, there are hereby created and established two (2) special districts which include all of the land lying within the instrument approach zone and transitional zone to the airport as shown on the airport master plan. These districts are represented on the official zoning map. 
                  Sec. 23-1004. - Height restrictions. 
                  Except as otherwise provided in this article, no structure or tree shall be erected, altered, allowed to grow, or maintained in either of the districts created by this article, to a height in excess of the height limit shown on the official zoning map. For any structure or tree constructed or planted between the height limit lines as shown on the official zoning map, the limitations of the height can be determined by taking the ratio of the horizontal distance perpendicular to the lowest height limit line to the closest point on the structure or tree divided by the total horizontal distance between the height limitation lines times ten (10); that will equal the height above the lowest height limitation line that the structure or tree can be erected or allowed to grow. 
                  Nothing in this article shall be construed as prohibiting the growth, construction or maintenance of any tree or structure to a height up to twenty (20) feet above the surface of the land. 
                  Where an area is covered by more than one (1) height limitation, the more restrictive limitation shall prevail. 
                  Sec. 23-1005. - Use restrictions. 
                  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this article, no use may be made of any land within either district established by this article in such a manner as to create electrical interference with radio communication between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for piloted aircraft to distinguish between airport lights and other lighting, result in glare in the eyes of pilots using the airport, landing, taking off, or maneuvering of aircraft. 
                  Sec. 23-1006. - Nonconformances. 
                  The regulations prescribed by this article shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering, or other changes or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to the regulations as of the effective date of this article, or otherwise interfere with the continuance of any nonconforming use. Nothing herein contained shall require any change in the construction, alteration, or intended use of any structure, the construction or alteration of which was begun prior to the effective date of this article, and is diligently prosecuted. 
                  Notwithstanding the preceding provision of this section, the owner of any nonconforming structure or tree is hereby required to permit the installation, operation, and maintenance thereon of such markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the building inspector to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport, the presence of such airport hazards. Such markers and lights shall be installed, operated, and maintained at the expense of the airport. 
                  Sec. 23-1007. - Permits. 
                  Future uses: Except as specifically provided in this section, no material change shall be made in the use of land and no structure or tree shall be erected, altered, planted, or otherwise established in either district hereby created unless a permit therefore shall have been applied for and granted. Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired, with sufficient particularity to permit it to be determined whether the resulting use, structure or tree would conform to the regulations herein prescribed. 
                  If such determination is in the affirmative and applicant has complied with all other applicable laws of the City of Doraville, the permit shall be granted. 
                  (1)  In the areas lying within the limits of the instrument approach zone district, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure which would be less than seventy-five (75) feet of vertical height above the ground, except when such tree or structure would extend above the height limit prescribed. 
                  (2)  In the areas lying within the limits of the transition zone district, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than seventy-five (75) feet of vertical height above the ground except when such tree or structure, because of terrain, land contour or topographic features, would extend above the height limit prescribed for such transition zones. 
                  Except as provided herein, nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be construed as permitting or intending to permit any construction, alteration, or growth of any structure or tree in excess of any of the height limits established by this article. 
                  Existing uses: No permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an airport hazard or permit a nonconforming use, structure, or tree to be made or become higher, or become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on the effective date of this article or any amendments thereto or than it is when the application for a permit is made. 
                  Nonconforming uses abandoned or destroyed: Whenever the building official determines that a nonconforming structure or tree has been abandoned or more than eighty (80) percent destroyed, physically deteriorated, or decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations. 
                  Hazard marking and lighting: Any permit or variance granted may, if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this article and is reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the owner of the structure or tree in question to permit the airport at its' own expense, to install, operate, and maintain thereon such markers and lights as may be necessary to indicate to flyers the presence of an airport hazard. 
                  ARTICLE XI. - BUFFER AND SCREENING PROVISIONS 

                  Sec. 23-1101. - Provision for planted buffers. 
                  It is recognized that the adjacent location of certain land uses may create an incompatible situation that can be mitigated by the installation of a planted buffer. An incompatible situation can arise due to the location of commercial or industrial uses adjacent to residentially zoned land, or to a lesser extent due to location of two-family or multiple-family residences adjacent to single-family residential districts. 
                  Therefore, when land is to be rezoned for a use creating an incompatible situation, or when a use deemed incompatible is modified or expanded, a planted buffer shall be provided along all sides and rear property lines to insulate adjacent properties from adverse impacts. 
                  The following situations constitute creation of incompatibilities and are subject to buffer requirements of this article: 
                  (1)  The location of commercial or industrial land use directly adjacent to residentially-zoned land. 
                  (2)  The location of two-family developments or multiple-family developments directly adjacent to land zoned for single-family residences. 
                  The City Council may require a planted buffer between other districts or land uses when it is determined by the City Council that an incompatible situation exists. 
                  Sec. 23-1102. - Required buffers. 
                  The required buffer shall provide necessary visual privacy for the conduct of residential lifestyles in an undisturbed environment, and shall provide for the protection and preservation of property values in residential districts. 
                  Planted buffers shall be established and maintained by the owner of the property containing the incompatible land use. The determination of incompatibility shall be based upon the existing character of the area in which the proposed action takes place. For example, proposed development or modification of commercial or industrial land use adjacent to an area developed as residential shall require the owner of the commercial or industrial property to install and maintain the planted buffer. If, however, nonresidentially zoned land is rezoned for development of residences and this property is located adjacent to land developed as, or zoned for, nonresidential use, the owner of the property to be rezoned for residences shall be required to install and maintain the planted buffer. 
                  The requirements for planted buffers are as follows: 
                  (1)  Where commercial or industrial land uses are contiguous with land zoned for single- family residential use, the minimum width of the required planted buffer shall be forty (40) feet. 
                  (2)  Where commercial or industrial land uses are contiguous with land zoned for two-family or multiple-family residences, the minimum width of the required planted buffer shall be thirty (30) feet. 
                  (3)  Where two-family or multiple-family land uses are contiguous with land zoned for single-family residences, the minimum width of the required planted buffer shall be twenty (20) feet. 
                  In all other instances, the minimum width of a planted buffer as determined by the City Council shall not be less than twenty (20) feet and not more than seventy-five (75) feet. Plantings attaining a minimum height in excess of that required herein might be required to mitigate the impacts of certain projects. 
                  The required planted buffer can be incorporated into the yard setback as specified in the appropriate zoning district. 
                  Sec. 23-1103. - Minimum specifications. 
                  The following are minimum specifications for required planted buffers. Buffers shall: 
                  (1)  Be depicted in detail (the type and location of natural and planted vegetation are to be illustrated) on each site plan or plat prior to approval, and shall be designated as a permanent easement. 
                  (2)  Not to be disturbed by grading, property improvements or construction activities except where necessary to prevent a nuisance, or to thin such natural growth, where too dense to permit natural growth, or to remove diseased, misshapen or dangerous and decayed timbers. Any contemplated disturbances shall first be brought to the attention of the City Council and formal approval secured prior to initiating activity within required buffer areas. 
                  (3)  Utilize existing vegetation in an undisturbed state where it has been determined that existing vegetation is appropriate for inclusion within the buffer strip, or when required be supplemented with approved, additional plantings. 
                  (4)  Retain the natural topography of the land, except when a portion must be cleared and graded as required by the local law to prevent soil erosion or sedimentation. 
                  (5)  Be completely installed in accordance with the approved plan prior to issuance of the certificate of occupancy. 
                  (6)  Not be used for temporary or permanent parking or loading, other than for provision of drainage improvements as mandated by local law, or for a structure other than a fence. 
                  (7)  Attain a minimum height of six (6) feet within three (3) years of the planting date. 
                  Sec. 23-1104. - Buffer composition and maintenance. 
                  In those instances where the natural vegetation and topography are sufficient to achieve the desired level of screening as determined by the City Council, a planted buffer shall be provided and shall consist of plant material of such growth characteristics as will provide an acoustical and visual screen. The following plants are approved for use as part of the screening buffer: 

                   
                  Sec. 23-1105. - Screening. 
                  Certain uses such as junk or salvage yard operations and other commercial and industrial operations requiring the storage of inoperative equipment or vehicles for prolonged periods of time could present unsightly views or health hazards. To preclude this from occurring, the City Council shall require owners of such properties to completely enclose such operations by a fence which completely obscures views of the property from adjacent sidewalks and streets, built to a height greater than that of the height of the highest piece of equipment or vehicle stored on the property provided that no fence shall be less than eight (8) feet nor more than twenty (20) feet in height when measured from the crown of the adjacent street(s). Such fences shall be constructed of solid materials. Construction of cyclone fencing, which utilizes metal inserts as screening, shall be prohibited. Fencing along street frontages shall be located not closer than ninety (90) feet from the centerline of the adjacent street. Uses existing at the date of adoption of this article shall have three (3) years to come into compliance. 
                  Many operations which involve the stacking of inoperative or obsolete equipment or vehicles posing a direct health hazard to the public. The City Council shall require all such operations to submit to an annual inspection by the DeKalb County Board of Health. The results of such inspections shall be delivered to the City Council for review. If a business fails to pass such inspection, it shall have thirty (30) days to comply or it shall cease operations until such time that compliance is effected. 
                  ARTICLE XII. - PARKING AND LOADING 

                  Sec. 23-1201. - Parking and loading spaces required. 
                  It is the intent of this article that all buildings, structures and uses of land shall provide off-street parking and loading space in an amount sufficient to meet the needs caused by the building or use of land and that such parking and loading spaces be so oriented that they are in fact readily usable for such purposes. 
                  Each use of land and each building or structure hereafter constructed or established, and each addition to a structure shall provide off-street parking and loading according to the standards set forth herein. When an addition is made to a building containing less than the required parking or loading requirements, a conforming amount of parking or loading shall be supplied based upon the size of the addition. 
                  No addition to an existing building shall be constructed which reduces the number of spaces, area or usability of existing parking or loading space unless such building and its addition conforms to the regulations for parking and loading contained herein. 
                  Sec. 23-1202. - General requirements. 
                  Off-street parking spaces for single-family and two-family dwellings shall be located on the same lot or plot of ground as the building to be served. Off-street parking spaces for uses other than single-family and two-family dwellings shall not be located more than three hundred (300) feet distant from such uses measured along the nearest pedestrian walkway. 
                  Parking requirements for two (2) or more uses of the same or different types may be satisfied by the allocation of a common or collective parking facility. Such facility shall not be less than the sum of the requirements for the individual uses computed separately in accordance with the requirements of this article, except that up to one-half (½) of the parking requirements for churches and similar places of public assembly may be satisfied by the parking areas of other dissimilar uses when the hours of operation are normally at different times of the day. 
                  When multiple uses occupy a building, the parking and loading requirement shall be met by determining the percentage of the total building area devoted to each type of use and then applying the appropriate requirements by use. 
                  For any use not listed, the City Council shall determine the proper requirement by classifying the proposed use among the uses specified herein as to assure equal treatment. In making any such determination, the City Council shall follow the principles set forth in the statement of purpose at the beginning of this section. 
                  Sec. 23-1203. - Compact car parking. 
                  The parking requirements of this article will permit the designation of compact car spaces. Compact car spaces may occupy up to twenty (20) percent of required parking spaces. If compact spaces are included as part of the parking requirement, each such space shall be clearly labeled on the ground. 
                  The following table depicts the minimum number of off-street parking spaces and loading stalls required by type of permitted use:

                  ARTICLE XIV. - APPEALS AND VARIANCES 

                  Sec. 23-1401. - Appeals process. 
                  When it is alleged that an error has been made in interpretation of the provisions of this Ordinance or when decisions relating to provisions of this article aggrieves any person, an appeal may be made within thirty (30) days of the decision by the party aggrieved by said interpretation or decision.

                  Sec. 23-1402. - Variances. 
                  The Mayor and/or City Council as relevant are authorized upon appeal in specific cases to consider such variances from the terms of this article as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of the article will, in an individual case, result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of the article shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. The existence of a nonconforming use of neighboring land, buildings or structures in the same or in other districts shall not constitute a reason for a variance. A variance may be granted in an individual case of unnecessary hardship upon a finding by the Mayor and/or City Council as relevant that all the conditions in subsection 23-1402(1) through (7) are met. When the Mayor and/or City Council, staff or appointed bodies consider approval, denial or nonbinding recommendations on variances as may be relevant, all of the conditions set out in subsection 23-1402(1) through (7) must be considered and found present or found not to be present. 
                  (1)  There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape or topography that are not applicable to other lands or structures in the same district. 
                  (2)  A literal interpretation of the provisions of this article would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties of the district in which the property is located. 
                  (3)  Granting the variance requested will not confer upon the property of the applicant any special privileges that are denied to other properties of the district in which the applicant's property is located. 
                  (4)  The requested variance will be in harmony with the purpose and intent of this article and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or to the general welfare. 
                  (5)  The special circumstances are not the result of the actions of the applicant. 
                  (6)  The variance requested is the minimum variance that will make possible the legal use of the land, building or structure. 
                  (7)  The variance is not a request to permit a use of land, buildings, or structures which is not permitted by right in the district involved.

                  (a)  Variances may not be granted from density or use requirements of properties. 
                  (b)  In granting a variance, the Mayor and Council may attach thereto any conditions which may be deemed advisable so that the purpose of this chapter will be served, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. 
                  (c)  As to development standards of this chapter, the authority to grant variances shall be limited to variances from the following requirements: 
                  (1)  In the case of a front, side or rear yard, the variance may not exceed fifty (50) percent of the minimum district requirement. 
                  (2)  In the case of the distance between the buildings on the same lot, the variance may not exceed ten (10) feet. 
                  (3)  In the case of parking requirements, the variance may not exceed fifty (50) percent of that required. 
                  (4)  In nonresidential districts, a height variance may not exceed approving building heights in excess of five (5) stories in planned centers of not less than four (4) acres.

Following review by the Planning Commission in accordance with this chapter and section 2-40 of the City Code, the Community Development Director shall place said variance on the next available City Council Agenda for a hearing. The Community Development Director shall advertise such hearing in the City's Legal Organ at least fourteen (14) days prior to the hearing and shall have authority to make such other notification as the Community Development Director deems necessary of the date and time of hearing and action requested. 
                  At the Planning Commission and City Council hearing any party may appear in person, or by attorney. The Mayor and Council shall hear the variance application and rule on same within reasonable time, but not later than thirty (30) days from the date of the hearing, and said ruling shall be given to the applicant in writing no later than three (3) business days after the date of the decision.

                  Sec. 23-1501. - Conditional use permits. 
                  (a)  Purposes. The purpose of a conditional use permit (CUP) is to allow the establishment of uses which may be suitable only in certain locations in a zoning district or only when subject to standards and conditions that assure compatibility with adjoining uses. Conditional uses are those uses which are generally compatible with the permitted land uses in a given zoning district, but which require individual review of their proposed location, design and configuration, and the imposition of conditions in order to ensure the appropriateness of the use at a particular location within a given zoning district. Only those uses enumerated as conditional uses in a particular zoning district shall be authorized as conditional uses. The CUP application must be accompanied by a site plan or building floor plan as deemed appropriate by the Community Development Director, drawn to scale depicting how the proposed conditional use will conform to all space limits, buffers, parking and loading provisions, and other provisions of the Code of Ordinances. 
                  (b)  Application process: 
                  (1)  Submittal of the application for a CUP.

                  b.  Include a notation as to whether or not any portion of the subject property is within the boundaries of the 100-year floodplain; and 
                  c.  Include a notation as to the total acreage or square footage of the subject property. 
                  Conditional use permit applications for individual units or suites within an existing multi-unit building shall be exempt from the survey plan requirement. 
                  (ii)  Name, mailing address, e-mail address and phone number of all owners of the property which is the subject of the application. 
                  (iii)  Signed and notarized affidavit of all owners of the subject property authorizing the filing of the application for conditional use permit and, where applicable, the signed and notarized affidavit of the owner of the subject property authorizing an applicant or agent to act on their behalf in the filing of the application for conditional use permit.

                  (8)  Conditions. The City Council may require such modifications in the proposed use and attach such conditions to the CUP as they deem necessary to mitigate adverse effects of the proposed use and to carry out the spirit and intent of the ordinance.

                  (3)  The proposed use is compatible with and preserves the character and integrity of adjacent developments and neighborhoods, and includes improvements either on-site or within the public rights-of-way to mitigate development related adverse impacts, such as traffic, noise, odors, visual nuisances, drainage or other similar adverse effects to adjacent developments and neighborhoods. 
                  (4)  The proposed use does not generate pedestrian and vehicular traffic which will be hazardous or conflict with the existing and anticipated traffic in the neighborhood. 
                  (5)  The proposed use incorporates roadway adjustments, traffic control devices or mechanisms, and access restrictions to control traffic flow or divert traffic as may be needed to reduce or eliminate development generated traffic on neighborhood streets. 
                  (6)  The proposed use incorporates features to minimize adverse effects, including visual impacts, of the proposed conditional use on adjacent properties; and the proposed use meets the standards for the zoning district, or to the extent variations from such standards have been requested, that such variations are necessary to render the use compatible with adjoining development and neighborhoods.

An application for a conditional use permit affecting all or a portion of the same property shall not be submitted more than once every twelve (12) months measured from the date of final decision of Mayor and City Council. The City Council may, by majority vote, waive or reduce this twelve-month time interval in case of a previously approved CUP.

                  Ornamental and structural detail. A raised or decorative feature, other than a corporate logo, and not including textures, color or materials. Examples are decorative tile, molding, niches, pilasters and columns. Corporate colors may be used as accents as per subsection 23-1705(d). 
                  Primary facade. A side of a building that faces a public or private right-of-way or roadway or has the primary customer entrance. (A building may have more than one (1) primary facade.) 
                  Secondary facade. A side of a building that is not a primary facade and either is visible from a public or private right-of-way or roadway or has a secondary or tertiary customer entrance. (A building may have more than one (1) secondary facade.) 
                  (Ord. No. 2014-09, § 1, 8-25-14) 
                  Sec. 23-1704. - Building orientation; primary and secondary facades. 
                  (a)  The intent of this section is to orient applicable buildings toward the public right-of-way or roadway or to private internal collector type/roadways and to establish architectural standards for primary and secondary facades in the City of Doraville. 
                  (b)  Primary and secondary facades shall satisfy the applicable facade standards set forth in this section. 
                  (c)  Building orientation. 
                  (1)  Mid-block commercial buildings shall be oriented to face the right-of-way/roadway, unless it can be shown that compelling site conditions necessitate a different orientation. If compelling site conditions necessitate that the building not face the right-of-way/roadway, then the building is considered to have two (2) primary facades: the facade that faces the right-of-way/roadway and the facade that incorporates the primary customer entrance. 
                  (2)  Corner lot commercial buildings shall be oriented to face a right-of-way/roadway, unless it can be shown that there are compelling site conditions that necessitate a different orientation. If compelling site conditions necessitate that the building not face such right-of way/roadway, then the building is considered to have three (3) primary facades: the two (2) facades that face the right-of-way/roadway and the facade that incorporates the primary customer entrance. 
                  (d)  Primary facades (see Table 23-1704-A for summary of requirements). 
                  (1)  All primary facades of a building shall have architectural style, detail, trim features, and roof treatments that are consistent with each other. Further, all primary facades shall have a similar level of treatment, detail and visual interest. This is inclusive of window, window frames, primary entrance, roof form (parapet, gable, hip, mansard or combination) and architectural elements (columns, pilasters, pediments, overhangs, balustrades, towers, dormers, cupolas and/or other projections of facade and fenestration). In lieu of actual windows and entrances, niches and alcoves with significant architectural delineation and definition to suggest window and entrance elements shall be used. 
                  (2)  For parcels one-half (½) acre or larger, building base perimeter landscaping shall be planted immediately adjacent to and along the full linear length of the primary facade, or between the walk immediately adjacent to the primary facade and the curb along the entire linear length of the primary facade. However, such perimeter landscaping shall allow for reasonable breaks for pedestrian access. The landscaped area shall be a minimum of five (5) feet in depth and shall include shrubs and groundcover with one (1) understory tree planted for each twenty-five (25) feet or fraction thereof of the lineal length of the primary facade. (Understory trees are to be planted no closer than ten (10) feet on center.) 
                  (3)  Office and institutional use primary facades shall have at least one (1) of the following components exclusive of [subsection] (4)(i) below; and a primary facade subject to subsection (2) of this section shall have at least one (1) of the following components exclusive of [subsection] (4)(ii) below. 
                  (4)  Commercial use primary facades shall have at least two (2) of the following components, except that a primary facade with the primary customer entrance shall have at least one (1) of the following components exclusive of the component described in subsection (4)(i) and a primary facade subject to subsection (2) of this section shall have at least two (2) of the following components exclusive of the component described in subsection (4)(ii). 
                  i.  The primary customer entrance. 
                  ii.  For parcels less than one-half (½) acre, building base perimeter landscaping shall be planted adjacent to and along the full linear length of the primary facade. The landscaped area shall be a minimum of five (5) feet in depth and shall include shrubs and groundcover with one (1) understory tree planted for each twenty-five (25) feet or fraction thereof of the lineal primary facade, planted for each fifteen (15) feet or fraction thereof of the lineal primary facade. (Understory trees are to be planted no closer than ten (10) feet on center.) 
                  iii.  Arcades or colonnades a minimum of six (6) feet in width, or other roof treatments that provide shade and break the vertical plane, shall be incorporated along at least fifty (50) percent of the linear length of the primary facade. 
                  iv.  Display windows a minimum of six (6) feet in height shall exist, along at least fifty (50) percent of the linear length of the primary facade. 
                  v.  Awnings associated with windows and/or doors, installed in increments of ten (10) feet or less in length, along at least fifty (50) percent of the linear length of the primary facade. 
                  vi.  Windows that cover at least forty (40) percent of the area of the primary facade. 
                  vii.  Any other treatment that, in the reasonable opinion of and with approval by the Community Development Director and recommendation by the City's Design Review Board, meets the intent of this section. 
                  (e)  Secondary facade standards (see Table 23-1704-B for summary of requirements). 
                  (1)  Secondary facades may be deemed wholly or partially inapplicable by the Community Development Director with recommendation by the Design Review Board, due to the narrowness and low visibility of the area between the side of the building and the side of the adjacent building, provided this determination may be made only where the side yard is less than ten (10) feet in width, and such determination does not modify applicable landscape and related requirements. 
                  (2)  All secondary facades of a building shall have architectural style, detail, trim features, and roof treatments that are consistent with those for the primary facade. 
                  (3)  Any side of an office, commercial or industrial building visible from and adjacent to residential areas shall be treated in the same manner as a secondary facade. 
                  (4)  For parcels one-half (½) acre or larger, perimeter landscaping planted adjacent to and along fifty (50) percent of the linear length of the secondary facade shall be required. The landscaped area shall be a minimum of five (5) feet in depth and shall include shrubs and groundcover with one (1) understory tree planted for each twenty-five (25) feet or fraction thereof of the fifty (50) percent lineal secondary facade. (Understory trees are to be planted no closer than ten (10) feet on center.) 
                  (5)  A secondary facade shall have at least one (1) of the following components: 
                  i.  For parcels less than one-half (½) acre, perimeter landscaping planted adjacent to and along fifty (50) percent of the linear length of the secondary facade shall be required. The landscaped area shall be a minimum of five (5) feet in depth and shall include shrubs and groundcover with one (1) understory tree planted for each twenty-five (25) feet or fraction thereof of the fifty (50) percent lineal secondary facade. (Understory trees are to be planted no closer than ten (10) feet on center.) 
                  ii.  Arcades or colonnades a minimum of eight (8) feet in width, or other roof treatments that provide shade and a break in the vertical plane shall be incorporated along at least fifty (50) percent of the horizontal length of the secondary facade. 
                  iii.  Display windows a minimum of six (6) feet in height shall exist along at least fifty (50) percent of the horizontal length of the secondary facade. 
                  iv.  Awnings associated with windows and/or doors, installed in increments of ten (10) feet or less in length, along at least fifty (50) percent of the horizontal length of the secondary facade. 
                  v.  Windows that cover at least forty (40) percent of the secondary facade. 
                  vi.  Any other treatment that, in the reasonable opinion of and with approval by the City's Design Review Board, meets the intent of this section. 
                  (6)  Exterior building materials shall be restricted on secondary facades as follows: 
                  i.  Corrugated metal panels, used as a finish material, shall not be allowed. The same type of architectural metal panels applied to the primary facade are acceptable for a secondary facade, subject to consultation by the city's Community Development Director and recommendation by the Design Review Board, that the treatment meets the intent of this section. 
                  ii.  Smooth-faced hard-coat concrete shall not cover more than thirty (30) percent of a secondary facade. 
                  iii.  Backlit awnings and backlit canopies including service station and convenience store backlit awnings and canopies shall be prohibited except for those portions of awnings or canopies which may have approved backlit sign copy area. 
                  (7)  Exterior ground level mechanical equipment, mechanical equipment package units, dumpster and trash receptacles, or related attachments (food freezers, air handling units, and etcetera) adjacent to a residential area or visible from a public right-of-way shall be concealed, hidden by a wall with caps as an extension of the building. When such units abut commercial or industrial uses and are not visible from a public right-of-way (i.e., they are not a primary or secondary facade), they shall be painted to match the color of the building. 
                  (Ord. No. 2014-09, § 1, 8-25-14)

                  (9)  Clock tower or bell tower. 
                  (10)  Sculptured artwork (excluding corporate logos or advertising). 
                  (11)  Any other treatment that, in the reasonable opinion of and with approval by the Community Development Director, with recommendation by the City's Design Review Board, meets the intent of this section. 
                  (c)  Exterior building materials contribute significantly to the visual impact of a building on the community. Exterior building materials shall be restricted on primary facades as follows: 
                  (1)  Corrugated metal panels, used as a finish material, are prohibited. Architectural metal panels are acceptable, subject to consultation and a determination by the city's Community Development Director and recommendation of [the] Design Review Board that the treatment meets the intent of this section. 
                  (2)  Highly reflective or mirror-like materials shall be prohibited. 
                  (3)  Blacked out or darkened windows of less than seventy-five (75) percent transparency and window treatments or uses that obscure clear visibility into and out-of the building shall be prohibited. 
                  (4)  Smooth-faced concrete shall have textured hard-coat stucco or other decorative finish. 
                  (5)  Backlit awnings and backlit canopies including service station and convenience store backlit awnings and canopies, shall be prohibited, except for those portions of awnings or canopies which may have approved backlit sign copy area. 
                  (6)  The use of full-depth brick, natural stone, cast stone, terra cotta, pre-cast concrete resembling brick or stone or hard coat stucco as major component of the primary facade with accents of ceramic tile, galvanized steel, glass block, wood, stone or hard-coat stucco are strongly encouraged. Alternative materials shall require approval of the Community Development Director with recommendation from the Design Review Board. 
                  (d)  Exterior building colors have a significant visual impact. Accordingly, colors are restricted as follows: 
                  (1)  Building color schemes that use colors that are electric, fluorescent or neon shall not be permitted on the exterior of any building. 
                  (2)  Building color schemes shall be consistent with the "Commercial/Institutional Color Chart" maintained by the City Community Development Department. A maximum of three (3) corporate colors, those colors normally recognized as representing the business in multiple locations as part of their corporate identity, and not incorporated within the Commercial/Institutional Color Chart adopted by the City, may be used for trim and cornice work. 
                  (3)  A maximum of three (3) colors may be used on the exterior of any building, plus one (1) additional color for trim or cornice work. Where a clear break exists giving the appearance of a separate building, such color scheme may be repeated. These limitations exclude unpainted natural stone or roof material. 
                  (4)  Graphics, color schemes, or murals shall not be permitted on a building except as may be permitted as a part of allowable signage consistent with chapter 14 of the City of Doraville's Code of Ordinances. 
                  (e)  Separate ancillary structures (carwash, cashier booths, canopies over gas pumps, etc.) shall have comparable pitch or parapets for roofs and shall otherwise have the same architectural detail, design elements and roof design as the primary structure, including the same cornice treatment, the same materials and colors, etcetera. 
                  (Ord. No. 2014-09, § 1, 8-25-14) 
                  Sec. 23-1706. - Roof treatments. 
                  (a)  The intent of this section is to add visual interest, and to reduce massing and screen rooftop equipment, by requiring minimum roof treatments. This section shall apply to all principal uses and to free standing ancillary or secondary uses, such as kiosks, ticket booths, car washes, and etcetera. 
                  (b)  Both single and multiple-tenant buildings are required to have variations in the rooflines, and roof features that are consistent with the building's mass and scale. In addition, roofs shall meet at least two (2) of the following requirements: 
                  (1)  Decorative parapets that are a minimum of three (3) feet in height above the finished roof or that are high enough to block the view of any mechanical equipment or fixtures that are situated on the roof. 
                  (2)  A three-dimensional cornice treatment, a minimum of twelve (12) inches in height, having a minimum of three (3) vertical (not diagonal) changes in plane (no two (2) on the same plane), and a variety of thickness in relief ranging from the greatest at the top to the least at the bottom.

                  (4)  Three (3) or more roof planes per primary facade. 
                  (5)  A sloping roof height (measured from the top of the supporting wall vertically to the peak of the sloping roof) shall not exceed the average height of the supporting walls. The sloping roof height shall not be less than a pitch of 4:12. However, a pitch of 3:12 may be acceptable depending on the mass and scale and elevations and renderings showing the appropriateness and compatibility of the design after consultation and approval of the City's Community Development Director, with recommendation by the Design Review Board. 
                  (6)  Any other treatment that, in the reasonable opinion of the Community Development Director and with recommendation by the City's Design Review Board, meets the intent of this section. 
                  (c)  Backlit awnings used as a mansard or canopy roof shall be prohibited in both single and multiple-tenant buildings.

                  (Ord. No. 2014-09, § 1, 8-25-14) 
                  Sec. 23-1707. - Customer convenience treatments. 
                  (a)  The intent of this section is to provide protection from the sun and adverse weather conditions for customers and employees of applicable businesses. These requirements are not applicable to single-tenant buildings with a gross floor area of ten thousand (10,000) square feet or less, or multiple-tenant buildings and projects with a gross floor area of less than twenty thousand (20,000) square feet. 
                  (b)  Except as provided under subsection (a) of this section, the following customer convenience treatments shall be required: 
                  (1)  Single-tenant buildings, with a gross floor area of over ten thousand (10,000) square feet and less than twenty thousand (20,000) square feet, shall have a highly visible primary customer entrance (see the current version of the Architectural Design Standards Guidebook maintained by the City for graphic representations). 
                  (2)  Single-tenant buildings with a gross floor area of twenty thousand (20,000) square feet or more shall have a highly visible primary customer entrance incorporating decorative landscape planters or wing walls that incorporate landscaped areas. 
                  (3)  Multiple-tenant buildings and projects with a gross floor area of twenty thousand (20,000) square feet or more shall have the following: 
                  a.  Anchor tenants shall provide highly visible primary customer entrances. 
                  b.  Decorative landscape planters or wing walls and intermittent shaded outdoor community space shall be provided. Such area shall be located adjacent to the primary customer entrance, or circulation path of the complex. 
                  (Ord. No. 2014-09, § 1, 8-25-14) 
                  Sec. 23-1708. - Facade treatments.[3] 
                  (a)  The intent of this section is to provide visual interest to all facades by requiring a minimum level of detail features on facades. These detail features shall not consist solely of applied graphics or paint. 
                  (b)  All facades of buildings with a gross floor area of twenty thousand (20,000) square feet or more shall be required to incorporate at least three (3) of the following facade treatments. At least one (1) of these treatments shall repeat horizontally. All such design elements shall repeat at intervals of no more than thirty (30) feet, either horizontally or vertically. All facades of buildings with a gross floor area of less than twenty thousand (20,000) square feet shall be required to incorporate at least two (2) of the following facade treatments. At least one (1) of these treatments shall repeat horizontally. All such design elements shall repeat at intervals of no more than twenty-five (25) feet, either horizontally or vertically. 
                  (1)  Expression of a vertical architectural treatment with a minimum width of twelve (12) inches. 
                  (2)  Building stepbacks, offsets or projections, a minimum of three (3) feet in depth. 
                  (3)  Color change. 
                  (4)  Texture and/or material change. 
                  (5)  Architectural banding. 
                  (6)  Pattern change. 
                  (7)  Any other treatment that, in the reasonable opinion of and with approval by the Community Development Director and recommendation by City's Design Review Board, meets the intent of this section. 
                  (c)  Blank wall areas on any facade shall not exceed ten (10) feet in vertical direction or twenty (20) feet in horizontal direction. Control and expansion joints constitute a detail feature only if incorporated as a decorative pattern and spaced apart at intervals of six (6) feet or less. Relief and reveal work depth must be a minimum of one-half (½) inch. 
                  (d)  Big box development: By encouraging the visual appearance of numerous smaller storefronts, in lieu of one (1) large big box storefront, this subsection is intended to reduce the large visual mass and monotonous exterior appearance typically associated with big box development (defined in section 23-402 of this Code). The standards in this subsection call for individually-peaked, forward-projecting, and vertically-oriented exterior architectural forms and features on street-facing facades and rooflines. Such forms will assist owners in architecturally expressing, on the exterior of their stores, the individual components (e.g., garden, grocery, pharmacy) within their stores. As such, the vertically-oriented, forward-projecting, and peaked components shall incorporate vertical components which serve to interrupt the pronounced horizontal roofline of big box structures and to reinforce the appearance of smaller, individual storefronts. 
                  (1)  Building entry finish materials. Owners shall maximize the amount of pedestrian-scaled windows (avoiding extensive opaque surfaces) along the street-facing facade which contains the primary customer entrance. Furthermore, owners shall utilize smaller-scaled, and darker colored, exterior finish materials (e.g., individual bricks or stone veneer in lieu of light-colored stucco on masonry or pre-cast concrete panels) on the lower portions (the "water table") of big box exterior walls which are adjacent to customer entrance(s), and which flank the exterior pedestrian sidewalk system on street-facing facades. Such darker, smaller-scaled finish materials shall be featured from the sidewalk grade, to no less than four (4) feet above sidewalk grade. 
                  (2)  Required transparent windows. Such primary customer entrance facades shall incorporate a minimum of twenty-five (25) percent transparency (windows). The transparency calculation may include the glass surfaces of the customer entrance window system itself. The area of required transparency shall be calculated by multiplying the structure's linear frontage by a height (above adjacent finished pavement grade) of twelve (12) feet. In addition, street-facing primary customer entrance facades shall incorporate an overhead projecting portico, arcade, or colonnade, as described below. Such customer entrance overhead forms shall, at a minimum, extend over the same twenty-five (25) percent transparency area. 
                  (3)  Transparency alternative; architectural projections. As an alternative to meeting the twenty-five (25) percent transparency and entranceway overhead form requirements, street-facing facades containing the primary customer entrance shall include covered porticos, arcades, colonnades, or a combination thereof, along a minimum of sixty (60) percent of the horizontal length of the subject facade. 
                  (4)  The roof plane of such porticos, arcades, or colonnades shall not extend horizontally for more than fifty (50) linear feet without the substantially and proportionately-sized, interrupting vertical architectural forms referenced above. The face (fascia) of such vertical forms shall project upward a minimum of fifteen (15) feet above the horizontal fascia of the portico, arcade, or colonnade lying below. The highest point of the fascia, or gable, of such vertical projections shall extend upward to a point at least as high as the horizontal roof line (parapet edge) of the big box development's principal structure. Furthermore, such vertical forms shall be no less than twenty (20) feet wide, as measured at the face (fascia) or base of the gable. 
                  (5)  The covered porticos, arcades, or colonnades shall incorporate the customer sidewalk below with a minimum pedestrian clearance (clear width), between the structure and the supporting columns, of twelve (12) feet. Such porticos, arcades, or colonnades, and twelve-foot wide sidewalks, shall not replace any required building foundation area landscape planter requirements for primary and secondary facades. 
                  (6)  Facades which face an adjacent street, but which do not possess the primary customer entrance (i.e., a side street facade), shall provide the above-referenced porticos, arcades, or colonnades, and associated individual roofline vertical projections, along at least forty (40) percent of the street-facing (side) facade. Such forty (40) percent requirement shall only apply to any segment of a side facade which does not incorporate a garden center decorative perimeter wall system as described in this subsection. 
                  (7)  Garden center walls. When a garden center is placed along a street-facing facade, a garden center decorative perimeter wall system may be substituted for the porticos, colonnades, arcades, and vertical form required above. Such garden center decorative wall systems shall be constructed of columns (posts) at least thirty-six (36) inches wide (or thirty-six (36) inches in diameter), and spaced no more than twenty-five (25) feet on-center along the perimeter of the garden center. 
                  i.  The columns shall be horizontally interconnected across each of their top portions with a substantial cross member. The columns or column cap component may extend above the horizontal cross members up to twenty-four (24) inches. Such upper horizontal cross member shall feature colors, finish, dimensions, proportions, and trim details which are architecturally consistent with the adjacent supporting columns and with the big box principal structure. The upper cross members shall be the highest visual component of the wall system, and no other fencing materials, or store merchandise, may protrude above the horizontal cross members. Disproportionate, undersized, or otherwise architecturally incompatible columns or horizontal cross member designs are prohibited.

                  (5)  The variance, if developed according to the plans and information approved, will result in development that is in harmony with nearby land uses. 
                  (6)  The variance will advance the presence of the intended form of the development. 
                  (c)  If a variance is requested in conjunction with an application for a Regulating Plan or Special Area Plan, the Mayor and City Council may process the requested variances concurrently.

Where a site includes multiple Transect Zones, each shall be calculated independently. The area of new Thoroughfares and Civic Spaces on the site shall be allocated to the closest Transect Zone(s) on the site. Where a Thoroughfare or Civic Space adjoins multiple Transect Zones, their area shall be proportionally allocated to the adjoining zones. 
                  (e)  Where a site is subdivided into lots, a lot's residential density may exceed the residential density of the Transect Zone within which it lies, provided that the maximum residential density of the Transect Zone for the site as a whole as established in Section 23-2006(c)(2) is not exceeded. 
                  (f)  Accessory Units do not count toward residential density calculations.
