         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE This Code constitutes a complete codification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of St. Marys, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances adopted by the mayor and council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Palmer Carr, Supervising Editor, and Laura Johnson, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Michael Mahaney, City Manager, and Mr. Terry K. Floyd, City Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

                  (B)  Assessments may be made on the basis of: 
                  (i)  The frontage abutting on the project at an equal rate per foot of frontage; or 
                  (ii)  The area of land served, or subject to being served, by the project, at an equal rate per unit of area; or 
                  (iii)  The value added to the land served by the project or subject to being served by it, being the difference between the appraised value of the land without improvements as shown on the tax records of the county and the appraised value of the land with improvements according to the appraisal standards and rules adopted by the county at its last revaluation, at an equal rate per dollar of value added; or

                  Whenever the basis selected for assessment is either area or value added, the mayor and council may provide for the laying out of benefit zones according to the distance of benefited property from the project being undertaken and may establish differing rates of assessment to apply uniformly throughout each benefit zone. 
                  For each project, the mayor and council shall endeavor to establish an assessment method from among the bases set out in this section which will most accurately assess each lot or parcel of land according to the benefit conferred upon it by the project.

                  Section 5-402. - Purchasing procedures. 
                  The mayor and council shall prescribe by ordinance the procedures for all purchases of real and personal property by the city. Competitive bidding shall be required for purchases and contracts and awards shall be made to the lowest or best bidder, except as where otherwise provided for by ordinance. Prior to the making of purchases and contracts, the availability of adequate funds shall be certified as provided by ordinance. 
                  The City of St. Marys encourages the use of local suppliers of goods, services and construction products whenever possible. The City of St. Marys also vigorously supports the advantages of an open competitive market place. Nothing in this Section shall be interpreted to mean that the City Manager or Purchasing Agent are restricted in any way from seeking informal or formal bids or proposals from outside the City of St. Marys market area. 
                  Local Vendor means a bidder or offeror which operates and maintains a brick and mortar business, i.e., a physical business address, within the city limits of the City of St. Marys, has a current business license, has paid in full all real and personal taxes owed the City, is considered a vendor in good standing with the City and can obtain an active vendor status. 
                  A local vendor may receive an opportunity to match for purchases, bids, proposal or contracts over $1,000.00 and less than $50,000.00. The local vendor may be given an opportunity to match the lowest price proposal, if the quotation or bid of the local vendor is within 5% of the lowest price proposal by a non-local vendor. In the event a local vendor matches the lowest price proposal, including all other terms, quality, services and conditions, then the local vendor shall be awarded the contract. 
                  In the event the price proposal of more than one local vendor is within 5% of the lowest overall price proposal of a non-local vendor, the local vendor with the lowest proposal will be given the first opportunity to match the lowest overall price proposal. If this local vendor declines to match the price proposal, then the local vendor with the next lowest bid within 5% will be given the opportunity to match the lowest proposal.

                  The provisions appearing in this Code, so far as they are the same as ordinances adopted prior to this Code and included in such Code, shall be considered as continuations thereof and not as new enactments.

                  (4)  Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case may be, or to "sections ____________ to ____________ " (inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code). 
                  (5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meanings of ordinance sections inserted into the Code; but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code.

                  Sec. 1-10. - Severability of parts of Code. 
                  It is hereby declared to be the intention of the mayor and council that the sections, paragraphs, sentences, clauses and phrases of this Code are severable, and, if any phrase, clause, sentence, paragraph or section of this Code is declared unconstitutional, invalid or unenforceable by the valid judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction, such unconstitutionality, invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect any of the remaining phrases, clauses, sentences, paragraphs and sections of this Code.

                  Sec. 1-11. - Altering Code. 
                  It shall be unlawful for any person to change or amend by additions or deletions any part or portion of this Code or to insert or delete pages or portions thereof, or to alter or tamper with this Code in any manner whatsoever which will cause the law of the city to be misrepresented thereby. Any person violating this section shall be punished as provided in section 1-12. 
                  State Law reference— Altering, falsifying or stealing public records unlawful, O.C.G.A. § 45-11-1. 
                  Sec. 1-12. - General penalty. 
                  Whenever in this Code or in any ordinance of the city any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an offense, or whenever in such Code or ordinance the doing of an act is required or the failure to do an act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is provided therefor the violation of any such provision of this Code or any ordinance shall be punished by a fine not exceeding $1,000.00, or by imprisonment in the city or county jail not to exceed six months. Any one or more of these punishments may be inflicted, and the fines imposed therefor may be collected by execution. Each day any violation continues shall be a separate offense. 
                  Editor's note— The provision for punishment by imprisonment for not more than six months is being used in this section for consistency with O.C.G.A. § 36-35-6(a)(2)(B) which restricts municipal corporations from extending home rule power over any action providing for confinement in excess of six months.

The complaint shall be filed with the mayor, or in the event the complaint regards the mayor, shall be filed with the mayor pro tem. No action will be taken on any compliant received unless said complaint uses the official City of St. Marys Board of Ethics Complaint Form, properly completed including name, address and signature of complainant. 
                  (b)  Upon receipt of the complaint, the mayor or the mayor pro tem, if the complaint regards the mayor, shall appoint three members of the board of ethics who shall constitute an investigating committee to determine whether the complaint sets forth significant facts and circumstances so as to warrant a hearing before the board of ethics. Appointment to the investigating committee shall be made on a rotational basis commencing at the top of the official list of members on file with the city clerk. 
                  (c)  The investigating committee shall conduct an investigation, which in all circumstances, must at least include interviewing the member of the governing authority who is the subject of the complaint.

In the event the complaint is found to state sufficient facts to warrant a hearing before the board of ethics, the board shall take action as provided herein. 
                  (e)  The complaint shall not be announced to the public until it is found to be justified by the investigating committee, but shall be subject to open records under Georgia law.

                  (10)  Whenever the licensee has defaulted in any obligation of any kind whatsoever, lawfully owing to the city, the city council, in its discretion, shall revoke the license of such licensee.

                  c.  In any event, no suspension shall be for a period of time longer than the time remaining under the license. 
                  As to the penalties as set forth above, if there is a change in a majority of the licensed establishment's owners, partners or shareholders, the violations under the prior ownership shall not count against the new owners; however, a different corporation, partnership or other association will be charged with the violation of its predecessor(s) if a majority of the owners, partners or shareholders are the same. 
                  (13)  Wherever this chapter permits the city to suspend any license issued under this chapter, the council, in its discretion, may determine the period of suspension within the following guidelines:

                  (14)  Notwithstanding any provision contained in this chapter to the contrary, the conviction, plea of guilty or nolo contendere of the applicant or its partners, officers or directors, if a corporation, of any crime involving the sale, possession or distribution of narcotics or controlled substances as defined in the Georgia Criminal Code, or any crime involving the sexual abuse, molestation, or exploitation of a minor, shall be grounds for the denial of or renewal of a license application or the suspension of a license previously granted, regardless of the period of time which has elapsed since the date of the conviction or entry of the conviction, plea of guilty or nolo contendere and the date of the filling of such application. 
                  (15)  Notwithstanding any provision contained in this chapter to the contrary, the commission or omission of any act which constitutes a crime of any kind or nature stemming from or related to the management, ownership or operation by an applicant or its partners, officers or directors (if not a natural person), of another establishment licensed for the sale of alcoholic beverages in a jurisdiction other than the City of St. Marys shall be grounds for denial of a license application within the City of St. Marys.

                  (b)  The requirement for approval is that the patio/open area be enclosed by some structure providing for public ingress/egress only through the main licensed premises. The purpose of this requirement is to prevent a customer from leaving the outside sales area with an open drink. 
                  (c)  The height of such structure shall be a minimum of 3½ feet above ground level. It does not have to be solid, nor does it have to restrict visibility into or out of the patio/open sales area. It must be permitted and approved by the city's building inspection department and the city's fire department, as required by their governing regulations or codes. 
                  (d)  The only exit from this type of area is to be through the licensed establishment's main premises and through an approved fire exit, not for general public use unless an emergency exists. The fire exit should be of the type that sounds an alarm so that the establishment will be alerted in the event of unauthorized use when no emergency exists. 
                  (e)  If a licensee desires a patio/open sales area inside an existing structure, plans will be reviewed and approved on an individual basis by the city council. Interior type patio/open sales areas must also meet the requirements of the city's building code. 
                  (f)  Nothing contained in this section shall prohibit a hotel or motel with a consumption on the premises license from making sales and allowing consumption of alcoholic beverages in ballrooms, meeting rooms, reception rooms, or patio areas of such hotel or motel, provided such functions are catered in connection with a meeting, conference, convention or similar type gathering at such hotel or motel. "Patio areas," as that term is used in this subsection, do not have to conform to the standards in this section. 
                  (Ord. of 3-7-11(1)) 
                  Sec. 10-29. - No consumption outside premises for classifications 1 through 7. 
                  (a)  It is prohibited for customers to leave the premises with open alcoholic beverages, and it is the licensee's responsibility to ensure that no open beverages are sold and carried out. However, nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the carrying out of wine or malt beverages for consumption at a publicly owned or privately owned golf course. 
                  (b)  It is prohibited for customers to gather outside an alcoholic beverage establishment and consume alcoholic beverages. 
                  (c)  It is prohibited for the manager or any employee to allow persons to gather outside an alcoholic beverage establishment and consume alcoholic beverages.

These inspections shall be made for the purpose of verifying compliance with the requirements of this chapter and state law. This section is not intended to limit the authority of any other city officials to conduct inspections authorized by other provisions of this Code. 
                  (Ord. of 3-7-11(1))

                  The chief of police, or his designee, may immediately close an establishment licensed under this chapter in case of emergency, for the safety of the public or to investigate a crime, for a period of time not to exceed 24 hours.

                  (a)  Subject to the exceptions as hereinafter set forth, it shall be unlawful for a person, business, establishment, or employee thereof, which imposes, collects, or charges any admission charge, ticket charge, entertainment fee, cover charge, setup or mixer charge, or contribution and which is not licensed under this chapter for on-premises consumption to permit any container of alcoholic beverages to be possessed or consumed by any guest, patron, or customer while on such premises. It is the intent and purpose of this provision to prohibit the operation of bottle clubs and brown bagging establishments which do not obtain and hold a valid on-premises consumption license. 
                  (b)  Such prohibition shall not, however, apply to activities or events sponsored or conducted by bona fide nonprofit civic or service organizations on an occasional basis.

The ordinance adopted March 10, 1997, furthermore, provided for the inclusion of the provisions of an ordinance adopted Nov. 11, 1996, as a new Art. III of this chapter. 
                  State Law reference— Prohibited conduct on licensed premises, O.C.G.A. § 3-3-40 et seq.; public indecency, O.C.G.A. § 16-6-8; giving massages in places used for lewdness, prostitution, assignation or masturbation for hire, O.C.G.A. § 16-6-17; establishment, maintenance or use of building, structure or place for unlawful sexual purposes, O.C.G.A. § 41-3-1; use of rooms in roadhouses, public dance halls, etc., for immoral purposes, O.C.G.A. § 43-21-61; maintaining a disorderly house, O.C.G.A. § 16-11-44; keeping a gambling place, O.C.G.A. § 16-12-23; keeping a place of prostitution, O.C.G.A. § 16-6-10; authority to demolish structures in which drug crimes are being committed, O.C.G.A. § 41-2-7; restriction of adult bookstores and movie houses to certain areas, O.C.G.A. § 36-60-3. 

                  Sec. 22-76. - Purpose. 
                  The purpose of this article is to regulate certain types of businesses generally known as and defined herein as adult entertainment establishments. To that end this article has been enacted in the interests of: 
                  (1)  Promoting the health, safety and general welfare of the residents of the city; and 
                  (2)  Preserving the quality of life in residential and business areas of the city; and 
                  (3)  Promoting desirable living conditions and sustaining the stability of residential and commercial property values. This article is intended to reasonably regulate adult entertainment establishments and businesses in order to serve the legitimate governmental interests set out herein. 
                  (Ord. of 11-11-96, § 1) 
                  Sec. 22-77. - Legislative findings of fact. 
                  Based upon the results of an investigation and the attendant evidence produced, the council finds that: 
                  (1)  The outright prohibition of adult entertainment establishments improperly infringes upon protected forms of expression; but that reasonable regulation of such businesses so as to curtail and prevent pernicious secondary effects is both permissible and desirable. 
                  (2)  Adult entertainment establishments and businesses, if unregulated, are likely to lead to an increase in illegal sexual activities, drug and alcohol offenses, disorderly conduct and other criminal activity. 
                  (3)  Law enforcement resources available for responding to problems associated with or created by adult entertainment establishments and businesses are extremely limited due to the growth of the city and county and such resources are best conserved by regulating and licensing adult entertainment establishments. 
                  (4)  The public health, safety, welfare and convenience of the residents of the city require that adult entertainment businesses and establishments and their locations, operations, employees and owners be regulated and licensed in order to reduce the potential for harm and in order to preserve and protect the quality of life in the residential and business environs of the city. 
                  (5)  The location of adult entertainment establishments and businesses in close proximity to each other adversely affects the property values, causes an increase in crime, and encourages residents and other businesses in proximity to such adult entertainment establishments to move and locate elsewhere. 
                  (6)  There is presently in North Florida, and particularly in the Jacksonville area, and in Southeast Georgia an increasing trend toward nude and semi-nude acts, exhibitions and entertainment, and toward the utilization of nude and semi-nude employees engaged in other service-oriented activities and by adult entertainment establishments. 
                  (7)  The commercial exploitation of nudity and semi-nudity consists of the use of nude and semi-nude entertainment in connection with or for the sale of goods or services, and the receipt of money by the person engaged in nude or semi-nude entertainment in exchange for or as consideration for a nude or semi-nude performance by such individual. Competitive commercial exploitation of nudity and semi-nudity is adverse to the public's interest in quality of life and commerce and the total community environment in the city and surrounding areas. 
                  (8)  The commercial exploitation of nude and semi-nude conduct, acts, exhibitions and entertainment frequently occurs in commercial establishments either selling or allowing the consumption of alcoholic beverages on the premises. 
                  (9)  There is a direct relationship between the consumption of alcoholic beverages concurrently with nude and seminude activities, conduct and entertainment and an increase in criminal activities, disturbances of the peace and good order of the city and the concurrency of these activities is hazardous to the health and safety of those persons in attendance and tends to depreciate the value of adjoining property and harm the economic welfare of the community as a whole. 
                  (10)  The combination of the sale and/or consumption of alcoholic beverages with the performance of nude and semi-nude entertainment is inimical and adverse to the public's interest in the quality of life and commerce and quality of the environment of the city. 
                  (11)  It is the duty and responsibility of the mayor and council for the city to protect and preserve the public health, safety, and welfare of the city and its residents, the stability of the value and use of property within the city, and the character of its neighborhoods and developments. 
                  (12)  In order to preserve the public peace and good order, and to safeguard and protect the health, safety and welfare of the city and its citizens, it is necessary and advisable to prohibit nude and semi-nude acts, exhibitions and entertainment in commercial establishments at which alcoholic beverages are available, sold, or consumed. 
                  (13)  In order to preserve the public peace and good order, and to safeguard and promote the health, safety and welfare of the city and its citizens, therefore, it is necessary and advisable to regulate and restrict the conduct of owners, operators, agents, employees, contractors, entertainers, performers, patrons, spectators, clientele and persons on the premises of adult entertainment establishments.

                  Editor's note— An ordinance adopted Jan. 23, 2012, amended ch. 30 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former ch. 30, §§ 30-1—30-4, pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from: Ord. of May 22, 1995(2), §§ 1, 2; Ord. of Jan. 12, 2004, §§ 1, 2; Ord. of Nov. 13, 2006, § 1; Ord. of Apr. 14, 2008(1), §§ 1, 2; and Ord. of Oct. 11, 2010, § 1. 
                  Cross reference— See Article IV of the Charter, Part II Related Laws for "Oak Grove Cemetery Authority" provisions enacted by H.B. 1188/Res. No. 2012-R002. 
                  State Law reference— Criminal trespass and damage to property, O.C.G.A. § 16-7-20 et seq.; permit for disturbing burial place in land development, O.C.G.A. § 36-60-6; preservation and protection of abandoned or unmaintained cemeteries, O.C.G.A. § 36-60-6.1. 

                  Sec. 30-1. - Purpose. 
                  The purpose for which the cemetery was created and is maintained is to provide a place dedicated and set apart for the burial of the dead and consecrated to a public and sacred use. 
                  (Ord. of 1-23-12) 
                  Sec. 30-2. - Ownership of lots. 
                  Ownership of the underlying land of the cemetery and any occupied or unoccupied lots rests solely with the city. Purchasers of lots within the cemetery are purchasing a license for the perpetual use of the lot for burial interment only. 
                  (1)  Lots in the original section of Oak Grove Cemetery, first known as the St. Marys City Cemetery or the Old Burying Ground, laid out by the city founders in 1788, are no longer subject to purchase from the city. They may be purchased from present lot owners if the lot owner can provide a recorded deed showing his legitimate ownership. It is the responsibility of the new owner to report the transfer of ownership to the city, pay a transfer fee in the amount as set by council and required by the city, and to have the new deed recorded at the courthouse at the owner's expense within one year of purchase. Unrecorded deeds will not create any responsibility on the part of the city to honor said unrecorded deed. Those with deeds to lots in the old section will be allowed to use them subject to the regulations in this article as long as they have a written and recorded deed. Should the plot have been in the possession of owners who have held possession for over 50 years and no deed is available, it is up to the family of the deceased to prove their relation to the family buried in that plot and to prove that the current family members, if any still living, approve the burial in the family plot, and that the lot is empty of a vault/casket, no matter its condition, or evidence of a previous burial. During the excavation by the funeral director, should the plot be shown to have been used previously for a burial, work will cease immediately, and the party handling the family's arrangements will be required to choose another plot in the new section of the cemetery. The new section is the portion of the cemetery located west of the main entrance road into the cemetery. 
                  (2)  Lots in the new section, west of the main entrance road into the cemetery, which have never been purchased or are proved to be empty with no recorded owner are available for sale. 
                  All regulations in the previous two paragraphs in regard to reporting and recording deeds and deed transfers and transfer fees apply.

                  DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 
                  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Alarm contractor means any person or vendor who installs, maintains, repairs, alters, monitors or services alarm systems for compensation. 
                  Alarm protocol means a confidential systematic program, as determined by the police department, to verify or otherwise confirm the validity of an alarm signal at a banking or other financial institution or any other business or service facility where deemed appropriate by the chief of police or his designated representative. 
                  Alarm signal means the audible sound or a transmission of a signal or a message as the result of the activation of an alarm system or an audible alarm. 
                  Alarm system means any mechanical or electrical or radio-controlled device which is designed to be used for the detection of smoke, fire or of any unauthorized entry into a building, structure or facility, or for alerting others of the possible commission of an unlawful act within a building, structure or facility, or both, which emits a sound or transmits a signal and/or message when activated. Alarm systems include direct dial telephone devices; audible, silent, fire and panic alarms; contractor monitored alarm systems; and proprietor alarms. Excluded from the definition of alarms systems are devices which are not designed or used to register alarms that are audible, visible or perceptible outside of the protected building, structure or facility; auxiliary devices installed by municipal utilities or telephone companies to protect utility systems from damage or disruption of services; or audible alarms that are affixed to motor vehicles. If an alarm system is designed to activate an audible alarm, the alarm system shall be designed so as to automatically deactivate the audible alarm after no more than 30 minutes of operation. 
                  Audible alarm means a device designed for the detection of fire or smoke or of unauthorized entry on premises which generates an audible sound when it is activated. 
                  Code enforcement officer means an officer employed by the City of St. Marys to ensure compliance with its Code of Ordinances or any St. Marys police officer detailed to perform duties under this article by the St. Marys Police Chief or his designee. 
                  Commercial premises means any structure or area which is not defined as a residential premises. 
                  False alarm means an alarm signal which is responded to by public safety personnel and, which is caused by other than an emergency situation, or which is not caused by the activation of either an alarm system or audible alarm as the result of fire or smoke, a burglary, robbery, assault, forced entry or attempted forced entry into the premises protected by such alarm. An alarm will not be deemed to be a false alarm when there is a substantial likelihood that the alarm is the result of inclement weather, or due to some other similar uncontrollable "act of God." An alarm will be deemed to be a false alarm when there is no substantial physical evidence which would clearly indicate that smoke, fire or a criminal act was the sole reason for activation of the alarm signal or when the alarm system was intentionally activated by an individual under circumstances where there was no articulable and reasonable basis to believe that a fire, crime or other emergency, warranting immediate response by the appropriate authorities, had occurred or was occurring, or was about to occur. The failure to abide by the established, current alarm protocol by those responsible on the premises will be considered a separate false alarm under this definition. 
                  Notice means written notice, given either by mail or by personal service upon the addressee. 
                  Residential premises means any structure or combination of structures which serve as dwelling units, including single-family as well as multifamily units.

If any such person or representative shall fail to appear to turn off an alarm within 30 minutes after being notified by the police department or their designated representative to do so, then the alarm contractor and/or owner or manager of the premises shall be in violation of this article and shall be punishable as provided by this article. 
                  (b)  All alarm systems shall have a 30-minute cutoff switch installed. Failure to install a cutoff switch shall constitute a false alarm and, furthermore, a violation of this article and may result in revocation of privileges, or criminal prosecution. 
                  (Ord. of 5-10-93, § 4) 
                  Sec. 42-38. - Requirements for alarm contractors.

                  Failure of the code enforcement officer to mail or serve the notice provided for in this division, shall preclude the assessment of a false alarm violation for the purpose of calculating the number of false alarm violations necessary to warrant punishment for subsequent violations.

                  (Ord. of 4-4-11) 
                  Sec. 46-95. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices. 
                  (a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the ordinance and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of this section. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit. 
                  (b)  Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
                  (1)  Best management practices as set forth in this subsection (b) and (c) of this section shall be required for all land-disturbing activities.

As used in this section the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
                  (2)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This subsection shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs.

                  (5)  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsections (c)15 and (c)16 of this section, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
                  (c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq., for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  (7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in runoff water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this subsection, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection (b)(2) of this section; 
                  (15)  Except as provided in subsection (c)(16) of this section, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream: That under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the groundwater table year-round; for which groundwater is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow, Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this subsection. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines. 
                  (d)  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq., shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. 
                  (e)  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of, nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit.

                  Sec. 46-96. - Application/permit process. 
                  (a)  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
                  (b)  Application requirements. 
                  (1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of St. Marys without first obtaining a permit from the planning department to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
                  (2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the planning department and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection (c) of this section. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of subsections 46-95(b) and (c) of this article will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by four copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
                  (3)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(5)(a), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. §§ 12-7-17(9), (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  (4)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by subsections 46-95(c)(15) and (16) has been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per subsection (b)(6) below, have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
                  (5)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this article section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application.

If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  (c)  Plan requirements. 
                  (1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in subsections 46-95(b) and (c) of this article, or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices.

                  (1)  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
                  (2)  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this article, any variances required by subsections 46-95(c)(15) and (16) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per subsection (b)(6) of this section are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
                  (3)  Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this article, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
                  (4)  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
                  (5)  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this article. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
                  (6)  The LIA may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(f)(1).

                  (a)  The public works department and/or the planning department will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article.

                  (d)  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
                  (e)  The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). The district or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
                  (f)  The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority.

                  These are the objectives, findings and conclusions of the city council considered in the formulation of the sign ordinance. 
                  (1)  Provide a reasonable balance between the right of an individual to identify his or her business and the right of the public to be protected against the visual discord resulting from the unrestricted proliferation of signs and similar devices. 
                  (2)  Permit the reasonable dissemination of all forms of speech. 
                  (3)  To guard against an excess of large, ugly, intense signs which cause visual blight on the appearance of the city. Visual blight adversely affects the aesthetic quality of life and traffic safety in the city for residents, businesses, pedestrians, and persons in vehicles. 
                  (4)  Protect the public health, safety and general welfare while protecting the rights of sign owners to expression and identification.

                  (9)  Eliminate excessive and confusing sign displays. 
                  (10)  Recognize that the size of signs that provide adequate identification in pedestrian-oriented business areas differs from those that are necessary in vehicular-oriented areas where traffic is heavy, travel speeds are greater, and required setbacks are greater than in pedestrian areas. 
                  (11)  Preserve and improve the appearance of the city as a place in which to live and to work and as an attraction to nonresidents who come to visit or trade. 
                  (12)  Encourage creative and well-designed signs that contribute in a positive way to the city's visual environment, express local character, and help develop a distinctive image for the city, and to discourage mediocre and poorly designed signs. 
                  (13)  Encourage new and replacement signage that is appropriately sized in its context so as to be easily readable. 
                  (14)  Encourage the construction, alteration, and repair of signs according to accepted and approved standards. 
                  (15)  Ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign regulations.

                  (a)  City occupation taxes, public liability insurance required. It shall be a violation of this article for any person to engage in the business of erecting or maintaining signs within the city, unless and until such entity shall have paid a city occupational tax or furnished proof of payment of an occupation tax to another municipality or county, reference section 22-24 of the St. Marys Code of Ordinances, and a certificate of insurance from an insurance company authorized to do business in the state evidencing that the person or entity has in effect public liability and property damage insurance.

It shall be the responsibility of the property owner, the operator of a business or activity discontinuing a lease if any, and the leasehold manager if any, ensuring compliance with the provisions of this section and each owner, operator, or manager shall be considered individually responsible for compliance with this section. Property owners will be given written notice, by certified mail with return receipt requested, of the appropriate procedures necessary for abandoned signs.

                  (2)  All abandoned signs that meet the definition of a pylon sign shall be removed within 60 days from the date of discontinuance. The director of planning or building may permit one 30-day extension of this removal period only in cases where special equipment is needed to remove the sign or sign structures, and removal of the structure cannot reasonably be arranged by the sign owner within the 60-day time period. 
                  (3)  This section shall not apply to the structure of a monument sign, provided that it might reasonably be used by a future tenant or property owner, complies with the provisions of this article, and is maintained in good condition; provided further, that the following shall be met: 
                  a.  If an abandoned monument sign contains a message panel that is removable from the monument structure without disassembling the monument, then within 30 days of the date of discontinuance said panel shall be removed and the portion of the monument structure that previously held the message panel shall be covered with durable cloth or canvas to avoid the appearance of blight, until such time as a new sign permit is applied for and granted and an approved sign panel is installed in said monument. 
                  b.  If an abandoned monument sign contains a sign copy area that is not removable without disassembling the monument, then said sign copy area shall be modified (e.g., painted over) or covered with durable cloth or canvas so that the sign copy pertaining to the business or activity discontinued is no longer visible, until such time as a new sign permit is applied for and granted and approved sign copy is affixed on the sign copy area of said monument. 
                  (d)  Removal of signs not maintained. All signs shall be maintained by the property owner in good condition so as to present a neat and orderly appearance. The director of the department of planning or building may remove or cause to be removed after notice any sign that shows gross neglect, becomes dilapidated, or in the opinion of the chief building inspector poses a threat to public safety. The director of the department of planning or building or his designee will give the owner 45 days' written notice, by certified mail with return receipt requested, to correct the deficiencies or to remove the sign or signs, except signs that pose a threat to public safety which shall be removed in accord with this section. If the owner refuses to correct the deficiencies or remove the sign, the director of the department of planning or building or his designee will have the sign removed at the expense of the owner.

                  Sec. 46-200. - Title and purpose. 
                  (a)  Title: This article will be known as Wetlands Protection ordinance of the City of St. Marys, Georgia. 
                  (b)  Purpose: The wetlands in the City of St. Marys are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion, and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; and open space and recreational opportunities. Nationally, a considerable number of these important resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution and other acts. Piecemeal or cumulative losses will, over time, destroy additional wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare of our community. 
                  This article is to promote wetland protection, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational and aesthetic values. Activities that may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practicable as determined through a permitting process.

                  Jurisdictional wetland determination : A delineation of jurisdictional wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. 
                  Regulated activity : Means any activity which will, or which may reasonably be expected to, result in the discharge of dredge or fill material into waters of the United States excepting those activities exempted in Section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act. 
                  Wetland : Means an area that is inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency and distribution sufficient to support, and under normal circumstances does support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions, commonly known as hydrophilic vegetation. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas. 
                  Wetland protection district : Means all wetlands within the jurisdiction of the City of St. Marys in Camden County, Georgia, as indicated on the wetlands map; provided however, that the wetlands map does not necessarily represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the City of St. Marys, Camden County, Georgia and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended.

                  (a)  When wetlands assessment required: This section is intended to provide applicants for a land disturbing activities permit with notice when the proposed activity may require a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACOE) permit due to impact upon jurisdictional wetlands. The provisions in the following paragraph of this section shall not apply if the applicant can provide to the city a valid USACOE wetland delineation that verifies that the proposed activity is not located within jurisdictional wetlands, or if the applicant can provide a valid USACOE permit or letter that authorizes the proposed activity within the jurisdictional wetlands. If such evidence of compliance with USACOE permitting requirements is provided, the city shall follow normal procedures for issuing a land-disturbing permit. 
                  (b)  Wetlands assessment: Prior to the issuance of a land disturbing activities permit the city shall assess whether the proposed activity could result in a disturbance of wetlands and, if so, shall also assess whether the proposed activity is located inside or within 50 feet of a wetland protection district. 
                  (1)  If the city determines that the proposed activity could not result in a disturbance of wetlands or if the proposed activity is not located inside or within 50 feet of a wetland protection district, the city shall follow normal procedures for issuing a land-disturbing permit. 
                  (2)  If the city determines that the proposed activity could result in a disturbance of wetlands and that the proposed activity is located inside or within 50 feet of a wetland protection district, a USACOE jurisdictional wetland determination shall be required prior to issuance of a land disturbing activities permit. No land-disturbing permit will be issued without a USACOE permit or letter of approval. If the USACOE determines that the proposed activity would not require a USACOE permit, the city shall proceed with normal procedures for issuing a land-disturbing permit. 
                  (3)  Wetlands inventories as identified in the current U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory Maps for Camden County, Georgia do not necessarily represent jurisdictional wetlands within Camden County and cannot serve as a substitute for a jurisdictional wetland determination or wetlands delineation.

                  ARTICLE IX. - GROUNDWATER RECHARGE AREA PROTECTION 

                  Sec. 46-220. - Title and purpose. 
                  (a)  Title: This article will be known as the "City of St. Marys, Georgia Groundwater Recharge Area Protection Ordinance." 
                  (b)  Purpose: In order to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate with the City of St. Marys, Georgia and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be ensured. For this reason, it is necessary to protect the subsurface water resources that the City of St. Marys, Georgia and surrounding communities rely on as a source of public water. 
                  Groundwater resources are contained within underground reservoirs known as aquifers. These aquifers are zones of rock beneath the earth's surface capable of containing or producing water from a well. They occupy vast regions of the subsurface and are replenished by infiltration of surface water runoff in zones of the surface known as groundwater recharge areas. Groundwater is susceptible to contamination when unrestricted development occurs within significant groundwater recharge areas. It is, therefore, necessary to manage land use within groundwater recharge areas in order to ensure that pollution threats are minimized.

                  Sec. 46-221. - Definitions. 
                  The following definitions shall apply to this article: 
                  Aquifer means any stratum or zone of rock beneath the surface of the earth capable of containing or producing water from a well. 
                  DRASTIC means the standardized system for evaluating groundwater pollution potential using the hydrogeologic settings described in U.S. Environmental Protection Agency document EPA-600/2-87-035. (Note: the "DRASTIC" methodology is the most widely used technique for evaluation of pollution susceptibility.) 
                  Pollution susceptibility means the relative vulnerability of an aquifer to being polluted from spills, discharges, leaks, impoundments, applications of chemicals, injections and other human activities in the recharge area. Recharge areas are determined to have a pollution susceptibility of high, medium, or low based on the Hydrologic Atlas 20, Groundwater Pollution Susceptibility Map of Georgia, prepared by the Natural Resources. 
                  Pollution susceptibility maps means maps of relative vulnerability to pollution prepared by the department of natural resources, using DRASTIC methodology. Pollution susceptibility maps categorize the land area of the state into areas having high, medium and low groundwater pollution potential. 
                  Recharge area means any portion of the earth's surface, where water infiltrates into the ground to replenish an aquifer. 
                  Significant recharge areas mean those areas mapped by the department of natural resources in Hydrologic Atlas 18 (current edition). Mapping of recharge areas is based on outcrop area, lithology, soil type and thickness, slope, density or lithologic contacts, geologic structure, the presence of karst, and potentiometric surfaces.

Said map is hereby adopted and made part of this article. 
                  (b)  Determination of pollution susceptibility: Each recharge area shall be determined to have a pollution susceptibility of high, medium, or low based on the Georgia Pollution Susceptibility Map, Hydrologic Atlas 20, 1992 edition. Said map is hereby adopted and made a part of this article.

                  Sec. 46-301. - Findings and intent. 
                  This article is adopted to address the interest of public health, safety and welfare. 
                  (1)  The governing authority finds that there is a need to establish a foreclosure and vacant real property as a mechanism to protect our citizens health, welfare and property values in neighborhoods for all property owners. 
                  (2)  Due to the lack of adequate maintenance and security of properties that are foreclosed or where ownership has been transferred after foreclosure, the health, welfare, property values and quality of life of neighboring properties and residents are negatively impacted. 
                  (3)  Improperly maintained and secured foreclosed properties can become a hazard to the health and safety of persons who may come on or near the property and can adversely affect the aesthetic and economic attributes of communities. Difficulties also often arise in locating the person responsible for the condition of foreclosed or vacant real property. The governing authority finds that there is a substantial need directly related to the public health, safety and welfare to comprehensively address these concerns through the adoption of the provisions in this article. 
                  (4)  This foreclosure and vacant real property registry will require owners and agents to provide the city with official information for contacting a party responsible for bringing foreclosed and vacant real property into compliance with applicable provisions of Municipal Code of St. Marys, Georgia.

                  Editor's note— Ord. No. 2014-001 , adopted Jan. 6, 2014, amended ch. 54 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former ch. 54, §§ 54-1—54-93, pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from an ordinance adopted Nov. 24, 2008(3), § 1.

                  Sec. 54-1. - Statutory authorization, findings of fact, purpose and objectives. 
                  (a)  Statutory authorization. Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a) have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the City Council of the City of St. Marys, Georgia, does ordain as follows: 
                  (b)  Findings of fact. 
                  (1)  The flood hazard areas of the City of St. Marys, Georgia are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (2)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
                  (c)  Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
                  (4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and 
                  (5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.

                  (1)  To protect human life and health; 
                  (2)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
                  (3)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; 
                  (4)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
                  (5)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
                  (6)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; and 
                  (7)  To ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

                  Sec. 54-3. - General provisions. 
                  (a)  Lands to which this chapter applies. This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of St. Marys, Georgia. 
                  (b)  Basis for area of special flood hazard. 
                  (1)  The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in its Flood Insurance Study (FIS), dated December 21, 2017 or latest maps as adopted by the city, with accompanying maps and other supporting data and any revision thereto, are adopted by reference and declared a part of this chapter.

All new construction and substantial improvements that include any fully enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater (not applicable in coastal high hazard areas). 
                  a.  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 
                  1.  Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
                  2.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and 
                  3.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both directions. 
                  b.  So as not to violate the "lowest floor" criteria of this chapter, the unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area; and 
                  c.  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be finished or partitioned into separate rooms. 
                  (5)  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding; 
                  (6)  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent floatation, collapse and lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state and city requirements for resisting wind forces; 
                  (7)  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system; 
                  (8)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters; 
                  (9)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding; and 
                  (10)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure, which is not compliant with the provisions of this chapter, shall be undertaken only if the nonconformity is not furthered, extended or replaced. 
                  (b)  Specific standards. In all areas of special flood hazard designated as A1-30, AE, AH, A (with engineered or estimated BFE), the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and substantial improvement of any structure including manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than two feet above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection (a)(4), "Elevated buildings" of this section. 
                  a.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above two feet above the base flood elevation. 
                  (2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction and the substantial improvement of any structure including manufactured housing, may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation (not applicable for coastal high hazard areas) the structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in section 54-6. An operation and maintenance plan shall be prepared to assure the continued viability of floodproofing measures. 
                  (3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
                  a.  All manufactured homes placed and substantially improved on: (1) individual lots or parcels; (2) in new and substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions; (3) in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions; or (4) on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than two feet above the base flood elevation. 
                  b.  Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that: 
                  1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than two feet above the level of the base flood elevation, or 
                  2.  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 48 inches in height above grade. 
                  c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement (ref. subsection (a)(6) of this section). 
                  d.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
                  1.  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; 
                  2.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick-disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions); or 
                  3.  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "new construction", including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsection (b)(1), above. 
                  (4)  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 54-3(b), are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during the base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting analysis, technical data and certification thereof. 
                  b.  Only if subsection (b)(4)a., above is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this chapter. 
                  (c)  Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations and floodway (A-Zones). Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in subsection 54-3(b) where streams exist but no base flood data and floodway data have been provided (A-Zones), the following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  For subdivisions and developments greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is less, base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivisions and all other proposed development, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions. Any changes or revisions to the flood data adopted herein and shown on the FIRM shall be submitted to FEMA for review as a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) or conditional letter of map amendment (CLOMA), whichever is applicable. Upon completion of the project, the developer is responsible for submitting the "as-built" data to FEMA in order to obtain the final LOMR. 
                  (2)  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with subsection 54-3(b), then the floodplain manager shall obtain review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of this chapter. Only if data is not available from these sources, the provisions of this chapter shall apply. 
                  (3)  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 25 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in more than one foot increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
                  (4)  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. (NOTE: Require the lowest floor to be elevated two feet above the estimated base flood elevation in A-Zone areas where a limited detail study has been completed). Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 54-6(4) "Elevated buildings". 
                  a.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. 
                  The floodplain manager shall certify the lowest floor elevation and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
                  (d)  Standards for areas of special flood hazard (Zones AE) with established base flood elevations and without designated floodways. Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in subsection 54-3(b), where streams with base flood elevations are provided but no floodways have been designated, (Zones AE) the following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  No encroachments, including fill material, new structures or substantial improvements shall be located within areas of special flood hazard, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community. The engineering certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles. 
                  (2)  New construction and substantial improvements shall be elevated or floodproofed to elevations established in accordance with subsection 54-6(b). 
                  (e)  Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO Zones). Areas of special flood hazard established in subsection 54-3(b), may include designated "AO" shallow flooding areas. These areas have base flood depths of one to three feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. The following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to at least two feet above as high as the flood depth number specified (in feet) on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 54-6(4), "Elevated buildings". 
                  The floodplain manager shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
                  (2)  New construction and the substantial improvement of a nonresidential structure may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to the specified flood level in this chapter plus two feet, above highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and as required in this chapter. An OandM plan shall be submitted to assure continued viability of the floodproofing measures. 
                  (3)  Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure. 
                  (f)  Coastal high hazard areas (V-Zones). Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in subsection 54-3(b), are areas designated as coastal high hazard areas (V-Zones). These areas have special flood hazards associated with wave action and storm surge, therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  (1)  All new construction and substantial improvements shall be located landward of the reach of mean high tide; 
                  (2)  All new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be elevated on piles, columns, or shear walls parallel to the flow of water so that the bottom of the lowest supporting horizontal structural member (excluding pilings or columns) is located no lower than two feet above the base flood elevation level. All space below the lowest supporting member shall remain free of obstruction or constructed with non-supporting breakaway walls. Open wood lattice work or decorative screening may be permitted for aesthetic purposes only and must be designed to wash away in the event of abnormal wave action and in accordance with subsection (6), below; 
                  (3)  All new construction and substantial improvements shall be securely anchored on pilings or columns; 
                  (4)  All pile and column foundations and the structures attached thereto shall be anchored to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement due to the combined effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components, both (non-structural and structural). Water-loading values shall equal or exceed those associated with the base flood. Wind-loading values shall be in accordance with the most current edition of the International Building Code, as amended; 
                  (5)  A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design, specifications and plans for construction are in compliance with the provisions contained in this chapter; 
                  (6)  All space below the lowest horizontal supporting member must remain free of obstruction. Open wood lattice work or decorative screening may be permitted for aesthetic purposes only and must be designed to wash away in the event of abnormal wave action without causing structural damage to the supporting foundation or elevated portion of the structure. The following design specifications are allowed: 
                  a.  No solid walls shall be allowed; and 
                  b.  Material shall consist of open wood lattice or insect screening only; and 
                  c.  If aesthetic open wood lattice work or screening is utilized, any enclosed space shall not be used for human habitation, but shall be designed to be used only for parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises. 
                  (7)  Prior to construction, plans for any structures having open wood latticework or insect screening must be submitted to the floodplain manager for approval; 
                  (8)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to any structure shall not enclose the space below the lowest floor except with open wood lattice work or decorative screening, as provided in this section; 
                  (9)  There shall be no fill used as structural support, or to elevate areas used for septic tank drain fields. Limited non-compacted fill may be used around the perimeter of a building for landscaping/aesthetic purposes provided the fill will wash out from storm surge, (thereby rendering the building free of obstruction) prior to generating excessive loading forces, ramping effects, or wave deflection. The floodplain manager may approve design plans for landscaping/aesthetic fill only after the applicant has provided an analysis by an engineer, architect or soil scientist, which demonstrates that the following factors have been fully evaluated: 
                  a.  Particle composition of fill material does not have a tendency for excessive natural compaction; 
                  b.  Volume and distribution of fill will not cause wave deflection to adjacent properties; and 
                  c.  Slope of fill will not cause wave run-up or ramping. 
                  (10)  There shall be no alteration of sand dunes or mangrove stands, which would increase potential flood damage; 
                  (11)  Prohibit the placement of manufactured homes (mobile homes are not permitted within the City of St. Marys as per Ordinance No. 110), except in an existing manufactured homes park or subdivision. A replacement manufactured home may be placed on a lot in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision provided the anchoring standards of section 54-6 are met. 
                  (g)  Standards for subdivisions. 
                  (1)  All subdivision proposals and other development proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage; 
                  (2)  All subdivision proposals and other development proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage; and 
                  (3)  All subdivision proposals and other development proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
                  (h)  Standard for critical facilities. 
                  (1)  No new critical facilities and substantial improved critical facilities shall be located in the 100-year floodplain or the 500-year floodplain.

                  Sec. 54-7. - Variance procedures. 
                  (a)  The planning commission as established by the City of St. Marys shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this chapter. 
                  (b)  The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the floodplain manager in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. 
                  (c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the St. Marys Planning Commission may appeal such decision to the court of proper jurisdiction as provided by ordinance or by state law. 
                  (d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (g)  In reviewing such requests, the planning commission shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this chapter. 
                  (h)  Conditions for variances: 
                  (1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
                  b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  (2)  The provisions of this chapter are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of a historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (4)  The floodplain manager shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (i)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this chapter, the planning commission may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

                  "Floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
                  "Freeboard" means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of floodplain management. "Freeboard" tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, blockage of bridge and culvert openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed. 
                  "Highest adjacent grade" means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, adjacent to the proposed walls of a structure. 
                  "Historic structure" means any structure that is:

                  "Lowest floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement. An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage, in an area other than a basement, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of other provisions of this chapter. 
                  "Manufactured home" means a building, transportable in one or more sections built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and similar transportable structures placed on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer and intended to be improved property.

For purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988, or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map are referenced. 
                  "National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD)" as corrected in 1929, is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
                  "New construction" means, for the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced after June 1, 1984 and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced after June 1, 1984, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
                  "New manufactured home park or subdivision" means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after June 1, 1984. 
                  "North American Vertical Datum (NAVD)" has replaced the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 in existing and future FEMA Flood Modernization Maps. 
                  "Recreational vehicle" means a vehicle, which is: 
                  (1)  Built on a single chassis;

                  "Start of construction" means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. (Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (NOTE: accessory structures are NOT exempt from any ordinance requirements.) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  "Structure" means a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. 
                  "Subdivision" means the division of a single lot into two or more lots for the purpose of sale or development. 
                  "Substantial damage" means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
                  "Substantial improvement" means any combination of repairs, reconstruction, alteration, or improvements to a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. NOTE: The market value of the structure should be: (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement; or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. The term does not, however, include: 
                  a.  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions. 
                  For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the structure commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. 
                  "Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions" is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  "Variance" is a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. 
                  "Violation" means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  (a)  Disposition of all trees, at least ten inches in diameter, as measured at a point 48 inches above the ground, in the historic district shall be determined by either the HPC or the City of St. Marys Tree Board in compliance with this section. Within private parcels of the historic district, if there is an immediate threat to life or property, posed by a dead or dying tree, the community development director has the authority to have the tree removed. Within private parcels of the historic district, where a tree is dead, diseased or in otherwise poor health, as determined by the community development director, and is not considered an imminent threat, the tree board will have sole jurisdiction to authorize removal. Within private parcels of the historic district, where a tree is determined to be healthy by the community development director and requested to be removed by either the city or a property owner, the historic preservation commission shall have sole jurisdiction as to its removal. However, the HPC requires that for all live oak trees determined to be removed for any reason, one new live oak of minimum diameter of two inches shall be planted on the site. Replacement of other species of trees shall be replaced as per the requirements of the tree board. 
                  (b)  If a dead or damaged tree poses an immediate and/or imminent physical threat to the safety of the community, or danger to citizens, historic property or other property as evidenced by appropriate documentation by either a tree removal specialist, or the community development director, the community development director may authorize its removal without going before the historic preservation commission, with notification to the HPC, the tree board and the city manager. The city manager will notify council of this action. Documentation shall be in writing with appropriate data as necessary to state the reasons for the immediate removal of the tree(s). 
                  (c)  If the tree board is eliminated by direct action of council, all jurisdiction of trees on private property in the historic district or historic properties shall be transferred to the HPC. In the event of any conflict with the tree board ordinances, the HPC ordinance shall govern.

                  Sec. 62-114. - Guidelines and criteria for review. 
                  (a)  When considering applications for certificates of appropriateness to exterior architectural and environmental features of historic properties or within historic districts, the Secretary of the Interior's "Standards of Rehabilitation" and the "St. Mary's Historic District Guidelines Study, June 30, 1986, by Galyon and Associates/PDM" shall be used as a guideline along with any other criteria adopted by the commission. 
                  (b)  Determine the classification of the property according to section 62-86, by year built, era in context and architectural style. 
                  (c)  If classified as historic or historic-obscured, the commission shall determine that: 
                  (1)  A property will be used as it was historically or be given a new use that requires minimal change to its distinctive materials, features, spaces, and spatial relationships. 
                  (2)  The historic character of a property will be retained and preserved. The removal of distinctive materials or alteration of features, spaces, and spatial relationships that characterize a property will be avoided. 
                  (3)  Each property will be recognized as a physical record of its time, place, and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features or elements from other historic properties, will not be undertaken. 
                  (4)  Changes to a property that have acquired historic significance in their own right will be retained and preserved. 
                  (5)  Distinctive materials, features, finishes, and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property will be preserved. 
                  (6)  Deteriorated historic features will be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature will match the old in design, color, texture, and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features will be substantiated by documentary and physical evidence. 
                  (7)  Chemical or physical treatments, if appropriate, will be undertaken using the gentlest means possible. Treatments that cause damage to historic materials will not be used. 
                  (8)  Archeological resources will be protected and preserved in place. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures will be undertaken. 
                  (9)  New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction will not destroy historic materials, features, and spatial relationships that characterize the property. The new work will be differentiated from the old and will be compatible with the historic materials, features, size, scale and proportion, and massing to protect the integrity of the property and its environment. 
                  (10)  New additions and adjacent or related new construction will be undertaken in such a manner that, if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired. 
                  (d)  If classified as non-historic, intrusions, or vacant, the commission shall determine that: 
                  (1)  General design arrangement is in keeping with the district. 
                  (2)  Scale and massing are in keeping with surrounding properties. 
                  (3)  Context, texture and material of any architectural or environmental features involved in the change and the relationship thereof to surrounding properties do not have a substantial adverse effect on the aesthetic, historic or architectural significance and value of the historic district.

                  (a)  The commission shall approve the application and issue a certificate of appropriateness if it finds that the proposed material changes in the appearance would not have a substantial adverse effect on the aesthetic, historic, or architectural significance and value of the historic property or the historic district. In making this determination, the commission shall consider, in addition to any other pertinent factors as outlined herein and in other sections of the ordinance, the historical and architectural value and significance, architectural style, general design arrangement, scale, mass, context, texture and material of the architectural features involved in the relationship thereof to the exterior architecture style, and pertinent features of the site and other structures in the immediate neighborhood. 
                  (b)  The commission shall deny a certificate of appropriateness if it finds that the proposed material change in the appearance would have identifiable adverse effects on the aesthetic, historic or architectural significance and value of the historic property or the historic district. 
                  (c)  The commission may make approval of a certificate of appropriateness conditional upon complying with certain situations which may be listed in the certificate.

                  3.  Upon the motion being seconded, discussion will follow customary meeting procedures as contained elsewhere in chapter 62 - Historic Preservation. 
                  (9)  Nonconforming signs. 
                  a.  Nonconforming signs that met all legal requirements when erected may stay in place until the deterioration of the sign or damage to the sign makes it a threat to public safety, and no repairs have been effected within five days of receipt of registered or certified notice, return receipt requested, from the community development department directing that immediate repairs are necessary to protect public safety. Any sign removed in accord with this section, shall not be replaced except in accord with the current requirements of this article. 
                  b.  Any nonconforming sign shall either be eliminated, or made to conform to the requirements of this article, when any proposed change, repair, or maintenance would constitute an expense of more than 50 percent of the lesser of the original value or replacement value of the sign. 
                  (10)  Enforcement. This article shall be administered and enforced by the community development director or his or her designee. In case any sign that is proposed to be erected, constructed, altered, converted, or used in violation of any provision of this article, the community development director may, in addition to other remedies, and after notice to the appropriate person, issue a citation for violation of the city ordinance thereby requiring the presence of the violator in municipal court; institute the filing of a petition for an injunction, or other appropriate action or proceeding to prevent such unlawful erection, construction, alteration, conversion, or use to correct or abate such violation. Additionally, the director of the department of planning or building may have the sign removed at the expense of the owner with a lien filed against the property, and may issue a citation for violation of the city ordinance to the agent that placed the sign, as well as those parties responsible for directing the agent, including the person or business owner whose name, message, and/or address, and/or telephone number appears on the sign. 
                  a.  The city, without warning or notice to the sign owner, may remove any sign located within a public street right-of-way immediately. Signs so removed shall be immediately destroyed without any consideration of compensation to the sign owner, known or unknown. 
                  b.  Penalty for violation. Any person violating any provision of this article or conditions of the issued permit, or stop-work order shall be subject to a fine up to $1,000.00 per violation per day or by imprisonment for a period not to exceed 60 days, or both. 
                  c.  City occupation taxes, public liability insurance required. It shall be a violation of this article for any person to engage in the business of erecting or maintaining signs within the city, unless and until such entity shall have paid a city occupational tax or furnished proof of payment of an occupation tax to another municipality or county, reference section 22-24 of the St. Marys Code of Ordinances, and a certificate of insurance from an insurance company authorized to do business in the state evidencing that the person or entity has in effect public liability and property damage insurance. 
                  d.  Termination of sign permit and/or city occupation license. Violation of any provision of this article will be grounds for terminating the sign permit granted by the city to the owner and/or the occupation tax certificate of the person or entity erecting the sign. Except as otherwise provided in this article, no permit and/or occupation tax certificate shall be suspended, revoked or canceled except for cause as hereinafter defined, and the permittee is granted a public hearing before the planning commission. The permittee will be given ten days' written notice, by certified mail and return receipt requested, of the time, place and purpose of the hearing, with a statement of the reason for the suspension, revocation or canceling of such permit and/or certificate. "Cause" is the willful and/or continued violation of the provisions of this article. The termination of the permit and/or license does not in any way preclude the person or persons alleged to have violated the provisions of this article from being tried under the enforcement provisions of this article. Should a permittee fail to pick up the certified mail, and said mail is returned, this failure to pick up will not delay the termination action or create any defense to stay any enforcement action. 
                  e.  Removal of abandoned signs. It is the intent of this section to establish reasonable time periods for the removal of abandoned signs. For purposes of this section, all signs pertaining to a business, service, institution, industry, or other activity that ceases operations shall be deemed to be abandoned. For purposes of this section, "ceases operations" shall be interpreted literally and to include cases where there is substantial evidence that a business or activity has vacated the building or grounds; provided, further, that this section shall not apply to any case where a business or activity is temporarily suspended and there is evidence that the business or activity will resume operations within a specifically designated period. It shall be the responsibility of the property owner, the operator of a business or activity discontinuing a lease if any, and the leasehold manager if any, ensuring compliance with the provisions of this section and each owner, operator, or manager shall be considered individually responsible for compliance with this section. Property owners will be given written notice, by certified mail with return receipt requested, of the appropriate procedures necessary for abandoned signs. Should a property owner fail to pick up the certified mail, and said mail is returned, this failure to pick up will not delay the termination action or create any defense to stay any enforcement action. 
                  1.  All abandoned signs that meet the definition of a window sign, wall sign, off-premises directional sign, marquee or canopy sign, temporary sign requiring a permit, or temporary sign, shall be removed within ten days from the date of discontinuance. The community development director may permit an extension of this removal period only in cases where special equipment is needed to remove the sign and removal of the sign structure cannot reasonably be arranged by the sign owner within the ten-day time period. 
                  2.  All abandoned signs that meet the definition of a pylon sign shall be removed within 60 days from the date of discontinuance. The community development director may permit one 30-day extension of this removal period only in cases where special equipment is needed to remove the sign or sign structures, and removal of the structure cannot reasonably be arranged by the sign owner within the 60-day time period. 
                  3.  This section shall not apply to the structure of a monument sign, provided that it might reasonably be used by a future tenant or property owner, complies with the provisions of this article, and is maintained in good condition; provided further, that the following shall be met: 
                  (i)  If an abandoned monument sign contains a message panel that is removable from the monument structure without disassembling the monument, then within 30 days of the date of discontinuance said panel shall be removed and the portion of the monument structure that previously held the message panel shall be covered with durable cloth or canvas to avoid the appearance of blight, until such time as a new sign permit is applied for and granted and an approved sign panel is installed in said monument. 
                  (ii)  If an abandoned monument sign contains a sign copy area that is not removable without disassembling the monument, then said sign copy area shall be modified (e.g., painted over) or covered with durable cloth or canvas so that the sign copy pertaining to the business or activity discontinued is no longer visible, until such time as a new sign permit is applied for and granted and approved sign copy is affixed on the sign copy area of said monument. 
                  (iii)  Removal of signs not maintained. All signs shall be maintained by the property owner in good condition so as to present a neat and orderly appearance. The community development director may remove or cause to be removed, after proper written notice, any sign that shows gross neglect, becomes dilapidated, or in the opinion of the chief building inspector poses a threat to public safety. The community development director or his designee will give the owner 45 days written notice, by certified mail with return receipt requested, to correct the deficiencies or to remove the sign or signs, except signs that pose a threat to public safety which shall be removed in accord with this section. If the owner refuses to correct the deficiencies or remove the sign, the community development director or his designee will have the sign removed at the expense of the owner, with a lien filed against the property. Should a permittee fail to pick up the certified mail, and said mail is returned, this failure to pick up will not delay the termination action or create any defense to stay any enforcement action. 
                  (b)  When considering applications for certificates of appropriateness for new signage, the sign ordinance of the City of St. Marys will be used along with any other criteria adopted by the commission. Signs shall be as designated in the sign ordinance, and shall include banners, pole-mounted signs, building-mounted signs, flags (but not including U.S. flags) signs painted in windows, murals, seasonal and sale signs and sandwich board signs. Except for directional or public safety (public ROW), real estate (on private property), political (on private property with owner's permission), and personal (on private property) push in signs, all other types of push in signs are not permitted at any time in the historic district. Electronic flashing signs are not permitted at any time in the historic district. All signs shall be approved by the HPC as well as comply with the sign ordinance as administered by the community development department. Signs shall be as designated in the sign ordinance, and shall include banners, pole-mounted signs, building-mounted signs, flags (but not including U.S. flags) signs painted in windows, murals, seasonal and sale signs and sandwich board signs. 
                  (c)  All facades of the building and all structures or other site features visible from the public street or public alley and directly adjacent to the public street or alley shall be within the jurisdiction of the historic preservation commission.

                  (a)  All work performed pursuant to an issued certificate of appropriateness, shall conform to the requirements of such certificate. In the event work is not performed in accordance with such certificate, the community development director shall issue a cease and desist order and all work shall cease. 
                  (b)  The community development director shall issue stop-work orders for projects within the jurisdiction of the commission if: 
                  (1)  Work has begun which requires a certificate of appropriateness without such certificate. 
                  (2)  Work has begun with an expired certificate of appropriateness. It is done not in accordance with an issued certificate of appropriateness. 
                  (c)  In all such cases the owners of the projects involved may apply for a certificate of appropriateness and upon the issuance of a certificate of appropriateness, the stop-work order will be removed immediately. 
                  (d)  If any member of the historic preservation commission observes construction from the public street that may not be in compliance with the approved certificate of appropriateness, the commission member shall communicate his concerns to the community development director for investigation. The commission member shall not approach the applicant or engage in any discussions related to the building permit. Once an application for a COA is completed and submitted for consideration, no individual member of the HPC will engage in an ex parte communication/s with the applicant regarding the form and/or substance of the pending application prior to the meeting where the applicant's COA is to be reviewed by the HPC.

                  (a)  A certificate of appropriateness shall become void unless construction is commenced within six months of the date of issuance. A single six-month extension shall be considered by the historic preservation commission where the delay in the start of the work has been delayed for reasons beyond the direct control of the applicant. No further extension will be considered. 
                  (b)  Certificates of appropriateness shall be issued for a period of 18 months and are renewable upon written request of the holder of the certificate of appropriateness at least 30 days in advance of the 18-month period.

The report shall include the engineer's rationale for those opinions. 
                  (3)  An appraisal of fair market value of the property from a qualified professional appraiser. This appraisal must include a full market sales report to include comparable sales.

                  Sec. 62-155. - The process required for demolition and relocation hearings. 
                  (a)  The commission shall evaluate certified complete applications for demolition or relocation pursuant to the two-hearing procedure described in subsections 62-155(b) and (c) below. If the applicant is dissatisfied with the commission's decision at any of these hearings the applicant may appeal to city council pursuant to the procedures described in section 62-156. The commission may not grant a certificate of appropriateness for demolition or relocation until the hearing and determinations described in subsection 62-155(c) have taken place. 
                  (b)  At the initial hearing the commission will determine whether to permit demolition or relocation. At the hearing the applicant shall introduce the report described in subsection 62-153(a) above. The applicant may introduce evidence of hardship—financial, structural, as found in subsection 62-200(b) below. At this hearing the applicant or his or her representative may present, but is not limited to, the following: any documents, photos, opinions of licensed engineers, or financial information. If the hardship is claimed to be economic, the applicant shall be required to submit sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the application of the standards and regulations of this section deprives the applicant of a positive economic use or return on the subject property. Economic hardship shall be only one of the factors considered by the commission in determining whether to allow demolition or relocation. If the commission declines to permit demolition or relocation, it shall issue in writing the reasons for the denial to the owner. If the commission decides to permit demolition, it must proceed to the second hearing. 
                  (c)  At the second hearing the commission will review plans for a new building or other development proposed for that location. This hearing is no longer about demolition, but it is held after the decision to allow demolition has been made in the belief that any new plans for the site should not have any influence on the retention or demolition of a historic building. The commission may not issue a certificate of appropriateness for demolition or relocation until the applicant posts bond in an amount sufficient to ensure completion of the building or other development replacing the demolished or relocated structure, or finds that a vacant site does not create a substantial adverse impact for the site or district.

                  Editor's note— An ordinance adopted March 22, 2004, deleted former art. II of this chapter in its entirety and added provisions as a new art. II as herein set out. Former art. II, § 82-36, pertained to parades and demonstrations and derived unamended from the original Code. 

                  Sec. 82-36. - Short title. 
                  This article shall be known as the St. Marys "Public Event Ordinance". 
                  (Ord. of 3-22-04, § 1) 
                  Sec. 82-37. - Vesting authority. 
                  The mayor and council for the City of St. Marys (the "city") and its city manager shall be vested with the responsibility to receive applications for, and to accede to or deny, permits for the conduct in public spaces of demonstrative, informative, celebratory, or other forms of public expression, hereinafter referred to as an "event". The city manager shall determine to permit or refuse to permit any such conduct in or about public spaces solely on the basis of the factors or combination of factors set out hereinafter, and in light of a presumption that all peaceable expression not inconsistent with the goals of this article hereinbefore enumerated shall be permitted at all reasonable times and places. 
                  (Ord. of 3-22-04, § 2) 
                  Sec. 82-38. - Use of public spaces and facilities. 
                  There shall be no demonstrative, informative, celebratory, or other forms of public expression, either fixed or processional, conducted on, over, upon, or burdening the public properties of the city, or employing the facilities thereon, without first being permitted by the city after application made according to the requirements set out hereinafter. 
                  (Ord. of 3-22-04, § 3) 
                  Sec. 82-39. - Application. 
                  Within no less than 20 days prior to an event, the person or persons associated in fact, whether or not a legally recognized entity, who wishes to conduct such event, shall apply to the city for a permit. Such application shall at a minimum include: 
                  (1)  The name and address of the applicant. If the applicant is an association of persons in fact or in law, the application shall contain a description of the entity; the name of said entity, if named; the registered or recognized address of the entity, if any; the name of the person making the application on behalf of the entity; such person's relationship to said entity; and some demonstration or recitation of the authority of the person making the application to act on behalf of the entity. 
                  (2)  A plan for review by the city, which plan will include: 
                  a.  The anticipated number of persons participating in the event; 
                  b.  The date or dates of the event; 
                  c.  The hours of each day the event will be conducted; 
                  d.  The exact location of said event, or, if the event is processional or mobile, the route of the event; 
                  e.  Whether sound amplification equipment will be employed; 
                  f.  Whether artificial lighting will be employed; 
                  g.  Whether temporary static structures will be constructed or employed, whether vehicles will be employed, and if so, a description of same sufficient to permit the city to evaluate the permitting factors set out hereinafter; 
                  h.  A description of provisions necessary to the safety and welfare of the participants in the event and members of the public in the area where the event will be conducted and routes of access thereto and therefrom; 
                  j.  Whether the event will requires that public spaces or facilities be used or burdened, or the routes and means of access thereto and therefrom, be temporarily diverted from their dedicated or customary uses, or the public or private users thereof be diverted or excluded from, or limited in their uses or enjoyment of, or their access to or through, said spaces or facilities before, during or after the event. 
                  (3)  A disclosure as to whether the applicant or entity for whom the application is being made has in the past conducted or participated in an event of a substantially similar nature to that which is the subject of the instant application, and, if so, where and when such prior event(s) took place, and whether as a result of such event(s) the applicant or entity became the subject, whether or not then operating under the same name, as plaintiff or defendant, of any legal action, civil, criminal, or administrative. 
                  (4)  A disclosure as to whether the applicant or entity for whom the application is being made has defaulted upon or is in arrears as to any judgment civil, criminal, or administrative rendered against the applicant or entity, or is in violation of any injunction or restraining order entered against the applicant, or entity, whether or not then operating under the same name, as a result of participation in any prior event(s) or a substantially similar nature to that which is the subject of the instant application, and if so, a description of said judgment or order and an explanation for non-compliance. 
                  (5)  An indemnification and hold harmless agreement in favor of the city, its elected officials, officers, agents, and employees, in a form satisfactory to the attorney for the city. 
                  If, as a direct consequence of exigent, unanticipated or other circumstances beyond the control of the applicant the applicant is unable to file an application not less than 20 days before an event, nothing herein shall be construed as precluding the filing of an application at a later time, but in such case the time limits for review by the city, and for review and appeal in the case of a denial of a permit, shall remain the same. 
                  Where an event conducted on, over, upon, or burdening public properties, or employing the facilities thereon, which is also to substantially involve or take place partly or wholly upon private property with the consent of the owner(s) thereof, such owner(s) or their authorized representatives must join as an applicant for any permit for such event. 
                  (Ord. of 3-22-04, § 4) 
                  Sec. 82-40. - Review by the city. 
                  Within seven working days of receipt of an application, the city manager shall review the application in light of all of the contents thereof and the goals, intentions, and presumption of this article as set out hereinbefore, and render a decision and communication same to applicant, either permitting the event as planned or denying a permit for same. If the permit is denied, the city manager shall provide the applicant in writing a statement of the reasons therefore. (First class mail to the address provided by applicant, postmarked no more than seven working days after receipt of the application, shall be sufficient for this purpose, though not the exclusive means of notice.) 
                  Nothing in this process shall prevent the city manager, at his/her sole option and within the seven days' period for approval or denial, to confer with applicant with respect to modifications of applicant's plan for the event, and amend the application to reflect such modifications if agreed to by the applicant. However, applicant may neither supplement nor amend its application within said seven days' period except at the invitation of the city. Any attempt to do so shall be automatically deemed a separate and new application. 
                  The city manager may deny the application for permit upon any of the following reasons or combination of reasons: 
                  (1)  The application does not contain all required information, or that information set out is so incomplete, vague, or ambiguous as to prevent full and proper review by the city; 
                  (2)  The application contains material omissions, falsehoods, or misrepresentations; 
                  (3)  The applicant or entity represented by applicant is incompetent to contract, sue, or be sued; 
                  (4)  The person applying lacks authority to represent the entity for which the application is made; 
                  (5)  The applicant or entity represented by applicant has on prior occasions damaged public property, or has not paid in full for such damages, or is in arrears as to any judgment civil, criminal, or administrative rendered against the applicant or entity, or is in violation of any injunction or restraining order entered against the applicant or entity, whether under the same name(s) or another; 
                  (6)  The applicant or entity represented by applicant has on prior occasions violated permitting ordinances in connection with events of a substantially similar nature; 
                  (7)  The plan of the event as proposed would present an unreasonable danger to the health or safety of participants in the event or other members of the public (though not through the agency of any predicted reaction by onlookers or members of the public); 
                  (8)  The plan of the event as proposed would unduly restrict and/or congest traffic (vehicular or pedestrian) on any of the public roads, rights of way, sidewalks, or waterways in the immediate vicinity of such event; 
                  (9)  The plan of the event as proposed would constitute an unreasonable disturbance of the peace, or would unreasonably burden lawful commerce in the area at the time of the proposed event, or would unreasonably intrude upon the privacy or property of citizens in the area of the proposed event (though not through the agency of any predicted reaction by onlookers or members of the public); 
                  (10)  The plan of the event as proposed includes activities which are prohibited by laws of the United States, the State of Georgia, or ordinances of the city or county, or activities which constitute a nuisance or tortuous conduct with respect to public or private property or persons. 
                  It is the specific intent of the city in enacting this article to regulate only the time, place and manner of events and not to regulate the content or message of any speech or expressive conduct. The factors enumerated above, which the city finds express and support the substantial and compelling interests in this governing body in the preservation of the rights and liberties of its citizens and the safety, health and good order of its society, are the only bases upon which the city manager shall decide to issue or deny a permit applied for hereunder, and no such decision shall be made or justified based upon the anticipated or predicted content of the speech or expressive conduct of any applicant. 
                  (Ord. of 3-22-04, § 5) 
                  Sec. 82-41. - Revocation. 
                  Notwithstanding the grant of any permit as provided herein, law enforcement authorities shall have the authority to terminate an event at any time, or prevent its initiation, should traffic, weather or other conditions develop which present an imminent and undue danger to those participation gin the event pursuant to said permit, to the public at large, or should any consideration or combination of considerations enumerated herein as a ground for denial of a permit arise or first become apparent to law enforcement authorities after the grant of a permit. If in preparation for or after the start of an event for which a permit has been issued, participants in said event violate the terms of the permit or deviate in material fashion from the plan submitted in application for the permit, law enforcement authorities shall have the authority to terminate the event. 
                  (Ord. of 3-22-04, § 6) 
                  Sec. 82-42. - Administrative review by city council. 
                  Upon receipt of any decision by the city manager denying an application, the applicant may within five calendar days file an appeal of said denial with the governing board of the city, which appeal shall be in writing and be sent to the city by certified mail or hand delivery. Upon the receipt of any such appeal the city manager shall notify the attorney for the city, who shall promptly (but in case no later than seven calendar days after receipt of the appeal) seek review of the denial of the application in a called meeting of the mayor and council. The city manager shall have the burden of demonstrating the validity of the denial of the permit as applied for by the applicant. If no appeal is filed by the applicant, there shall be no duty on the part of the city to seek judicial review of the decision of the city manager. Nothing contained herein shall preclude the applicant from seeking judicial review of a denial of a permit in a court of competent jurisdiction at any time after notification of the decision on the application.

                  (a)  It shall be the duty of every person cutting or making an excavation in or upon any public place, or place and maintain barriers and warning devices necessary for safety of the general public. 
                  (b)  Barriers, warning signs, lights, etc., shall conform to the requirements of all applicable city ordinances.

                  (e)  When traffic conditions permit the superintendent of public works may by written approval permit the closing of streets and alleys to all traffic for a period of time prescribed by him, if in his opinion it is necessary. Such written approval may require that the permittee give notification to various public agencies and to the general public. In such cases, such written approval shall not be valid until such notice is given. 
                  (f)  Warning signs shall be placed far enough in advance of the construction operation to alert traffic within a public street and cones or other approved devices shall be placed to channel traffic, in accordance with the instructions of the superintendent of public works.

                  ARTICLE I. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 

                  Sec. 86-1. - Title. 
                  This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the Subdivision Regulations of St. Marys, Georgia. 
                  Sec. 86-2. - Administration. 
                  This chapter shall be administered by the Planning Commission of the City of St. Marys. 
                  Sec. 86-3. - Authority of planning commission. 
                  Pursuant to the powers and jurisdictions vested through the city council and other applicable laws, statutes, ordinances and regulations of the state, the planning commission does hereby exercise the power to review, approve and disapprove plats for the subdivision of land within the corporate limits of the city, and to require minimum standards for improvements within such subdivided areas. 
                  Sec. 86-4. - Purpose. 
                  The purposes of the regulations are to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of the city. The overall objective of this chapter is to consider land subdivision plats as part of a plan for the orderly, efficient, and economical development of the land within the planning commission's jurisdiction. The following provisions shall guide the planning commission in formulating its decisions: 
                  (1)  Proposed streets shall compose a convenient and efficient traffic circulation system, properly related to the proposals of any transportation plan. Streets shall be of such width, grade and location to accommodate prospective traffic, provide adequate light and air, and to provide access by service and emergency vehicles. 
                  (2)  Land of suitable location, size and character for utility or drainage easements or public community services shall be shown on the subdivision plat wherever appropriate. 
                  (3)  Land to be subdivided shall be of such character that it can be used safely for building purposes without danger to health and welfare from flooding, fire, contamination, erosion and other menace. 
                  (4)  The development of any subdivision should avoid unnecessary environmental degradation; pollution of air, streams, ponds, and so on; and be in harmony with the natural environment. 
                  (5)  Protect and conserve the value of land and buildings throughout the city while avoiding conflicts among the uses of lands and buildings. 
                  (6)  Provide for adequate and efficient transportation, water, sewage, schools, parks, playgrounds, recreation, and other public requirements, facilities, and open space needs as will accommodate the anticipated rate of development. 
                  (7)  Establish reasonable standards of design and procedures for subdivisions and resubdivisions in order to further the orderly layout and use of land: and insurance of proper legal descriptions and monumenting of subdivided land to provide adequate records for land titles. 
                  (8)  Avoid excessive expenditure of public funds for the supply of public services. 
                  Sec. 86-5. - Jurisdiction and application. 
                  The jurisdiction of this chapter shall apply to all that incorporated area within the boundaries of the city and this chapter shall apply (except as specifically exempt herein) to the following forms of land subdivision: 
                  (1)  The division of land into two or more parcels, lots, or tracts. 
                  (2)  The dedication, vacation, or reservation of any public easement or right-of-way through any tract of land regardless of the area involved. 
                  (3)  The consolidation of two or more parcels, lots, or tracts into one or more larger parcels. This consolidation is defined as a "reverse subdivision". 
                  (4)  The leasing of any portion of any existing parcel where the leased parcel is a smaller portion of a larger parcel. This shall apply to all parcels leased as a smaller portion of a larger parcel regardless of the intent of the parcel owner to transfer ownership at any point. This applies to all zones. 
                  Sec. 86-6. - Tree protection plan. 
                  (a)  Protected trees. On single and subdivided commercial lots, the building and parking area must be identified and all remaining trees on single or subdivided lots shall be protected in a tree protection zone as outlined in this section. 
                  (b)  Protective measures. In the tree protection zone, protective measures shall be applied to the above ground portion of a tree and to roots within the critical root zone, as follows: 
                  (1)  Damage prohibited. No person shall: 
                  a.  Cut, carve, transplant or otherwise damage or remove any tree; 
                  b.  Attach any rope, wire, nails, advertising posters or other contrivance to any trees; 
                  c.  Allow any gaseous, liquid or solid substance which is harmful to trees (such as concrete washout, fuel, lubricants, herbicides, paint) to come in contact with them; or 
                  d.  Set a fire or permit any fire to burn when such fire or the heat of the fire will injure any portion of any tree. 
                  (2)  Fence required. During excavation, filling, construction or demolition operations, each tree or stand of trees shall be protected against damage to bark, roots and low-hanging branches with a fence enclosing the critical root zone (four feet high, two-inch by four-inch posts; with double one-inch by four-inch rails, plastic construction area fencing, or 12-gauge two-inch by four-inch wire mesh). "Tree save area" signs shall be posted on all sides of the fenced area. 'Critical root zone' shall be defined as the drip edge of the tree. 
                  (3)  Compaction prohibited. All buildings materials, vehicles, construction equipment, dirt, debris or other objects likely to cause soil compaction or above ground damage shall be kept outside the critical root zone. Where a limited amount of encroachment is unavoidable and is approved by the building official, the critical root zone shall first be mulched with a four-inch layer of processed pine bark or wood chips or a six-inch layer of pine straw. 
                  (4)  Grade changes prohibited. There shall be no raising or lowering of the ground level within the critical root zone. Stripping of topsoil in the critical root zone shall not be permitted. Where necessary, the use of moderate fill is permitted only with prior installation of an aeration system approved by the building official. The depositing of sediment in the critical root zone shall be prevented by placement of Type C sediment barriers, which shall be backed by two-inch by four-inch wire mesh in areas of steep slope. 
                  (5)  Ditches, trenches prohibited. No person shall excavate any ditch, tunnel or trench within the critical root zone. Where such encroachment is unavoidable and is approved by the building official, tunneling rather than trenching shall be used. If roots must be cut, root pruning procedures approved by the building official must be employed. 
                  (6)  Paving prohibited. No person shall pave with concrete, asphalt or other impervious material within the critical root zone. 
                  (c)  Plan required; contents. A proposal for development or improvement of any tract of commercial land shall include a tree protection plan, including trees to be planted in order to repopulate the landscape due to removing trees or due to the lot not having any trees. Such plan shall be submitted to the building official prior to any grading, bulldozing or other removal of the existing vegetation. The plan shall show the following: 
                  (1)  Names and addresses of the owner of record and the applicant. 
                  (2)  Boundary lines of the tract by lengths and bearings, streets adjoining the property, total area of the tract, north point, graphic scale and date. 
                  (3)  All existing specimen trees, including those to be removed, and all other trees ten inches in diameter at a breast height (DBH), measured at 4.5 feet from the ground, or greater which will remain on the site and shall be protected during construction. The owner of the property shall indicate the common and botanical names and the size of each tree. In heavily wooded areas that will not be disturbed, the site plan may show only the boundaries of each stand of trees and a list of the number, size and species of ten inches DBH or larger trees in each stand. 
                  (4)  Locations of all existing and proposed new buildings, structures and paved areas, whether to be removed or to remain. 
                  (5)  Locations of all existing and proposed new utility lines. New utility lines must be placed along corridors between critical root zones of trees which will remain on the site. 
                  (6)  Limits of land disturbance, clearing, grading and trenching. 
                  (7)  Limits of tree protection areas, showing trees to be maintained specifying species and size. 
                  (8)  Grade changes or other work adjacent to a tree which would affect it adversely, with drawings or descriptions as to how the grade, drainage and aeration will be maintained around the tree. 
                  (9)  Planting schedule and site plan showing where and what type vegetation will be planted on cleared land upon completion of construction project. A minimum of one, two-inch or larger DBH tree every ten feet between the commercial building and any roadway must be planted. 
                  (d)  No tree shall be planted closer to a building foundation or water, sewer, electrical or natural gas line than as follows: 
                  (1)  For a mature small tree, five feet. 
                  (2)  For a mature medium tree, ten feet. 
                  (3)  For a mature large tree, 15 feet. 
                  (e)  No tree shall be planted under overhead utility distribution lines if the average mature height of the tree is greater than the lowest overhead wire. 
                  (1)  Landscape islands shall be provided within parking areas of six or more spaces, but shall not be required within vehicle storage or display areas. Initial designs should take into account any existing trees whenever possible. Refer to chapter 110 article IV [of the St. Marys Code of Ordinances] for additional parking requirements. 
                  a.  The total area of all islands shall comprise at least five percent of parking lot area in commercial zoning districts or three percent of parking lot area in industrial zoning district; plus one percent of other vehicle use area on the property (such as loading, storage or display areas). 
                  b.  Each island shall contain a minimum of 50 square feet. It shall be so shaped that a five-foot diameter circle will fit within the island. No portion of an island less than three feet in width may be counted in the area. 
                  c.  Landscape islands shall be located in such a manner as to divide and break up the expanse of paving. 
                  d.  Vehicles may overhang the landscape island to a depth of 24 inches provided the island is at least 3.5 feet in depth per each abutting head to head parking space, at least 7.0 feet in depth overall for abutting head to head parking space, and protected by wheel stops or curbing. Two feet of the landscaped area may count as part of the required depth of each abutting head-in parking space. (Condition A of Figure 1). For spaces at the perimeter of the lot, and not abutting head-in parking, the vehicle may overhang the landscape island to a depth of 24 inches with no minimum island dimension. (Condition B of Figure 1) 

                  (2)  Distribution of trees shall be as follows: 
                  a.  At least one tree, as recommended in the St. Marys Trees and Shrub Ordinance section 102-48, shall be planted in each required landscape island, and at least one tree, as recommended in the St. Marys Trees and Shrub Ordinance section 102-48, shall be planted for every 30 linear feet of length in each required planting strip. 
                  (3)  Criteria for replacement trees shall be as follows: 
                  a.  Spacing and the potential size of species chosen shall be compatible with spatial limitations of the site. 
                  b.  The species must be ecologically compatible with the specifically intended growing site. 
                  c.  The trees must have the potential for size and quality comparable to those removed. 
                  d.  Preference shall be given to specimens of no more than three inches DBH. 
                  e.  Authority for questions of tree characteristics shall be City of St. Marys Ordinance sections 102-46 through 102-50; publications of the state forestry commission; publications of the cooperative extension service of the University of Georgia College of Agriculture; or other authority acceptable to the city. 
                  (4)  For specimen and nonspecimen trees, emphasis shall be given to the preservation of specimen trees, even isolated individual specimen trees, over retention of other nonspecimen trees. Nonspecimen trees, however, should be saved in stands rather than as individual trees scattered over a site. 
                  (5)  The property owner shall maintain trees on the property in accordance with this article and the approved plan, including replacing trees which die or are irreparably damaged.

                  Subdivision: The division of a tract, parcel or lot into two or more lots or building sites, or other divisions for the purpose, whether immediate or future, of sale, leasing, or legacy, or building development. This includes all division of land involving a new street or a change in existing streets and includes a resubdivision and, where appropriate, relates to the process of subdividing or to the land or area subdivided or to leased parcels. The following distinguishes between major and minor subdivisions; in the case of a minor subdivision, only a final plat is required while a major subdivision requires the filing of both a preliminary and final plat: 
                  (1)  Major subdivision: All subdivisions not classified as minor subdivisions, including, but not limited to, subdivisions of six or more lots, or any size subdivision requiring any new street or extension of the local governmental facilities, or the creation of any public improvements. 
                  (2)  Minor subdivision: Any subdivision containing not more than five lots fronting on an existing street, and not involving any new street or road, or the extension of municipal facilities, or the creation of any public improvements, and not adversely affecting the remainder of the parcel or adjoining property, and not in conflict with any provision or portion of the master plan, zoning ordinance, or this chapter.

                  Sec. 86-43 - Nonpotable reuse or reclaimed water requirements. 
                  (a)  Nonpotable reuse lines (NPRC). A nonpotable reuse water main shall be installed in all subdivisions located within the city council designated mapped areas indicating which areas within the City of St. Marys, may receive reuse or reclaimed water from a city waste water treatment plant meeting the effluent standards as determined by the Georgia Environmental Protection Division (EPD). The system shall include reuse or reclaimed water mains, valves, fittings, hydrants and distribution lines and shall be in accordance with the plans and specifications approved by the city engineer for the City of St. Marys. The system shall be designed and installed in accordance with the City of St. Marys Public Works Manual for Nonpotable Water Reuse or Reclaimed Facilities. 
                  (b)  These reuse or reclaimed water facilities shall be installed on all new subdivisions located within the designated mapped areas whether reuse or reclaimed water is currently available or not. Once reuse or reclaimed water is available, it will be provided to the existing infrastructure thus installed. The requirements of this section will not apply to existing subdivisions under construction as of the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter derives, or to subdivisions where the city has accepted all infrastructure improvements within that subdivision. Any completed subdivision developer, within the mapped areas, has the option to install reuse or reclaimed water lines, at their cost and to the requirements of the public works manual, to utilize the reuse or reclaimed water within their subdivision. 
                  (c)  The engineering plans for nonpotable reuse or reclaimed water systems shall be provided as part of the initial site engineering review along with the sanitary, water, and stormwater systems.

Said fees shall be made payable to the City of St. Marys. 
                  (d)  Action on preliminary plat. If the planning commission finds that the proposed design and proposed installation of improvements of the subdivision shown on the preliminary plat complies with the requirements of this chapter, it shall approve such preliminary plat. Preliminary plat approval does not release the engineer, surveyor or developer from complying with any and all requirements of the subdivision ordinance. If the planning commission finds that the proposed subdivision shown on the preliminary plat does not comply with the requirements of this chapter, then the planning commission shall either disapprove such plat or shall approve such plat on the condition that specified violations are corrected prior to the submittal of the final plat. When the planning commission disapproves a preliminary plat, it shall give the developer the reasons for such disapproval in writing. Except where an extension of time is requested by, and authorized by the applicant for the preliminary plat review, the planning commission shall have 90 days from the public hearing date of a preliminary plat to approve, or disapprove such plat; otherwise, the preliminary plat shall be deemed to have been approved and a certificate to that effect shall be issued by the planning commission on demand.

Such construction shall conform with the design and plans submitted to and approved by the city engineer. A performance bond as defined herein shall be provided when construction work begins prior to final plat submission. 
                  (f)  Time limit on preliminary approval. The planning commission's approval of a preliminary plat shall be valid for one year. If work has not started on a subdivision which has been granted preliminary plat approval on or before the end of this year period, then the plat of such subdivision shall be resubmitted for preliminary approval; provided, however, that this time may be extended by the planning commission unless changes have occurred in this chapter, or in the character of the property of the proposed subdivision which makes it necessary to revise and resubmit the design of the proposed subdivision.

                  ARTICLE V. - ASSURANCE FOR COMPLETION AND MAINTENANCE OF IMPROVEMENTS 

                  Sec. 86-81. - Completion of improvements. 
                  All improvements required in this chapter shall be guaranteed. All improvements shall be dedicated to the city, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances on the property and public improvements thus dedicated and accepted by the city council upon completion of the one year warranty. Before the final plat is recorded by the planning director, all applicants shall be required to complete all the street, sanitary, and other improvements as required in this chapter, specified in the final subdivision plat, and as approved by the planning commission and city council. 
                  Sec. 86-82. - Guarantee of improvements. 
                  (a)  Performance bond. 
                  (1)  The city council in its discretion may waive the requirement that the applicant complete and dedicate all public improvements prior to the signing of the final subdivision plat and that, as an alternative, the applicant post a bond at the time of application for final subdivision approval in an amount estimated by the applicant and approved by the city engineer as sufficient to secure to the local government the satisfactory construction, installation, and dedication of the incomplete portion of required improvements. The performance bond shall also secure all lot improvements on the individual lots of the subdivision as required in this chapter. Bond amount shall be in an amount not less than 150 percent of the estimate prepared by the applicant and approved by the public works department and/or city engineer. Any reduction in bond amount or partial release of bond shall only be authorized by city council. 
                  (2)  Such performance bond shall comply with all statutory requirements and shall be satisfactory to the city attorney as to form, sufficiency, and manner of execution as set forth in this chapter. The period within which required improvements must be completed shall be specified by the city engineer and approved by the city council in the resolution approving the final subdivision plat and shall be incorporated in the bond and shall not in any event exceed two years from date of final approval unless an additional time is approved in writing by city council. 
                  (3)  Such bond shall be approved by the city engineer as to amount and surety and conditions satisfactory to the city attorney and city engineer. The planning commission may upon proof of difficulty, recommend to the city council extension of the completion date set forth in such bond for a maximum period of one additional year. The city council may at any time during the period of such bond accept a substitution of principal or sureties on the bond upon recommendation of the planning commission. 
                  (4)  There shall be no expiration date on any properly issued bonds for any project. The bonds shall be rescinded only after all improvements are completed and all required documentation received and approved by the appropriate city departments and/or city council. 
                  (5)  If, for any reason, the applicant's bond is revoked, such revocation will result in an immediate stop work order until such time as a replacement bond is secured. No claim for damages related to the applicant's loss of bond will be permitted. 
                  (b)  One year warranty/maintenance bond. Applicant shall provide a one year warranty/maintenance bond on all improvements related to the subdivision. Developer shall repair/replace any items that need maintenance work within one year of the date of final acceptance (the date the bond is released, or other agreed upon date). The city engineer shall be the sole arbiter of deficient workmanship in this one-year warranty period. Developer shall provide a maintenance bond in the amount of ten percent of the total construction cost to be valid for a period of 12 months after acceptance by the city in writing of the improvements in any public or private development. Bond shall be in favor of the City of St. Marys. 
                  (c)  Temporary improvements. The applicant shall build and pay for all costs of temporary improvements required by the city council and shall maintain same for the period specified by the city council. Prior to construction of any temporary facility or improvement, the developer shall file with the city a separate suitable bond for temporary facilities, which bond shall ensure that the temporary facilities will be properly constructed, maintained, and removed. There shall be no expiration date on any properly issued bonds for any project. The bonds shall be rescinded only after all improvements are completed and all required documentation received and approved by the appropriate city departments and/or city council. 
                  (d)  Costs of improvements. All required improvements shall be made by the applicant, at his expense, without reimbursement by the city or any improvement district therein. 
                  (e)  Governmental units. Governmental units to which these bonds and contract provisions apply may file in lieu of said contractor bond a certified resolution or ordinance from officers or agencies authorized to act on their behalf, agreeing to comply with the provisions of this chapter. 
                  (f)  Failure to complete improvement. In those cases where a performance bond has been posted and required improvements have not been installed within the terms of such performance bond, the local government may thereupon declare the bond to be in default and require that all the improvements be installed regardless of the extent of the building development at the time the bond is declared to be in default. 
                  (g)  Acceptance of dedication offers. Acceptance of formal offers of dedication of streets, public areas, easements, and parks shall be by resolution of the city council. The approval by the planning commission of a subdivision plat shall not be deemed to constitute or imply the acceptance by the local government of any street, easement, or park shown on said plat. The planning commission may require said plat to be endorsed with appropriate notes to this effect. 
                  (h)  Alternate improvement guarantees. If the city council finds that a developer is not able to post a performance bond, the city council may require the subdivider to use one of the following improvement guarantee techniques: 
                  (1)  Sequential development. Where a subdivision is to be developed in phased portions, the city council may waive the use of a guarantee on the initial portion, provided that such portion may not contain more than 25 lots, or 50 percent of the total number of lots proposed for the subdivision, whichever is less. The city council may grant final plat approval to only one portion at a time, with the plat approval for each succeeding portion being contingent upon completion of all contracted improvements in each preceding portion, and acceptance of those improvements by the city council. Completion of improvements in the final portion of the subdivision, which must include at least 25 lots or 50 percent of the total number of lots in the subdivision, whichever is less, must be guaranteed through the use of a performance bond as defined herein or letter of credit as noted herein. 
                  (2)  Letter of credit. Subject to the approval of the city council, the subdivider shall provide a nonrevokable letter of credit from a bank or other reputable institution or individual. This letter shall be deposited with the city council and shall certify the following: 
                  a.  That the creditor guarantees funds in an amount equal to 150 percent of the estimated cost, as estimated by the subdivider and verified by the city engineer and approved by the city council, of completing all required improvements. 
                  b.  That if the subdivider fails to complete the specified improvements within the required period, the creditor will pay to the city immediately, and without further action, such funds as are necessary to finance the completion of those improvements, up to the limit of credit stated in the letter. 
                  c.  That this letter of credit may not be withdrawn, or reduced in amount, until released by the city council. 
                  Sec. 86-83. - Inspection of improvements. 
                  (a)  General procedures and fees. The city council shall provide for inspection of required improvements during construction and insure their satisfactory completion. The applicant shall pay to the City of St. Marys an inspection fee of one percent of the amount of the performance bond or the estimated cost of required improvements, and the subdivision plat shall not be recorded by the planning director unless such fee has been paid at the time of application. These fees shall be due and payable upon demand of the city and no building permits or certificates of occupancy shall be issued until all fees are paid. If the city engineer finds upon inspection that any of the required improvements have not been constructed in accordance with the city's construction standards and specifications, the applicant shall be responsible for completing the improvements. Wherever the cost of improvements is covered by a performance bond, the applicant and the bonding company shall be severally and jointly liable for completing the improvements according to specifications. 
                  (b)  Release or reduction of performance bond. 
                  (1)  Certificate of satisfactory completion. The city council will not accept dedication of required improvements, nor release, nor reduce a performance bond, until: 
                  a.  The city engineer has submitted a letter stating that all required improvements have been satisfactorily completed; and 
                  b.  The applicant's engineer or surveyor has certified to the city engineer, through detailed "as built" survey plat of the subdivision, indicating location, dimensions, materials, and other information required by the planning commission or city engineer that the layout of the line and grade of all public improvements is in accordance with construction plans for the subdivision. Follow the requirements of the public works manual. All as builts, shall be submitted in digital and paper form. All field notes that created the as builts shall be attached to this submission and become the property of the City of St. Marys; and 
                  c.  That a title insurance policy has been furnished to and approved by the city attorney indicating that the improvements shall have been completed, are ready for dedication to the city and are free and clear of any and all liens and encumbrances. 
                  Upon such approval and recommendation, the city council shall either accept the improvements and release the performance bond or reject the improvements within 45 days of such certifications by the city engineer. 
                  (2)  Reduction of performance bond or other improvement guarantee. A performance bond shall be reduced upon actual dedication of public improvements and then only to the ratio that the public improvement dedicated bears to the total public improvements for the plat. In no event shall a performance bond be reduced below ten percent of the principal amount, nor shall other improvement guarantee be reduced below ten percent.

               <head>Chapter 87 - ST. MARYS ENTERPRISE ZONE </head>
               <p>
                  Sec. 87-1. - Satisfaction of criteria. 
                  In the geographic area known as the St. Marys Enterprise Zone and as herein described in Exhibit A, a copy of which is attached to Ordinance No. 2013-029 and hereby incorporated by reference, in compiiance with O.C.G.A. § 36-88-6 and as subsequently amended, that the city finds the area meets the qualification of the Act by meeting the following criteria: 
                  (1)  Pervasive poverty. The enterprise zone is located in portions of Census Tract 106.011 and 106.013. Within these two census block groups, the percent of the total population below the poverty level is 18.49 and 22.82, according to the Georgia Department of Community Affairs American Community Survey, 2006-2010 Poverty Estimate. 
                  2.  Unemployment. Unemployment shall be evidenced by significant job dislocation was experienced at 1000 Osborne Street with the closure of Durango Paper Company, formerly known as Gilman Paper Company. The City of St. Marys has suffered greatly with the close of the mill. Countless supporting businesses in St. Marys including hardware stores, restaurants, retail establishments, and service companies have closed as a result of mill's closure. At the time of the mill's closure 850 full-time jobs were lost. 
                  (3)  General distress. The City of St. Marys Enterprise Zone area suffers from general distress and adverse conditions as evidenced by abandoned or dilapidated structures, deteriorated infrastructure, and substantial population decline. The nominated area, once primarily a center of paper manufacturing in nature, shows significant loss of business with a need for new employment opportunities to utilize the existing vacancies. Consequently, the area shows evidence of creeping blighted conditions that although scattered throughout the area, potentially pose a threat of future disinvestments creating a diminishing tax base within the area. Although most areas in St. Marys have increased or maintained their population, the population of the distressed sites has decreased as witnessed by the vacant storefronts. 
                  (4)  Underdevelopment. The Planning and Development Department for the City of St. Marys has amassed data showing that over the past five years there have been fewer building permits and land disturbance permits issued in the geographic area known as the St. Marys Enterprise Zone, and that the department collects less development fees, capital recovery fees, and other similar fees from the area as compared to other areas of the city. The City of St. Marys Planning Department has also amassed data that shows that there are less business license fees collected and less business licenses issued within the nominated area than within the local governing body's jurisdiction overall.

                  (7)  Creating jobs above the state threshold; and 
                  (8)  Creating jobs for residents of the enterprise zone and surrounding area.

                  Sec. 98-57. - Aid-to-construction fees. 
                  (a)  In order to connect to the City of St. Marys water and/or wastewater utility system, all residential, commercial, institutional, industrial or any other structure requiring water and/or wastewater utility services, shall pay an aid-to-construction fee in addition to any fees required by ordinance prior to connecting to the city water and/or wastewater system. 
                  (b)  The aid-to-construction fee will be based upon improvements needed for the water or wastewater infrastructure and construction or expansion of the water or wastewater treatment facilities serving the city. The city currently has two wastewater treatment facilities. The current wastewater treatment plants are known as the Point Peter Plant and the Scrubby Bluff Plant. Each aid-to-construction fee will be based on the expansion or construction needed for any and all improvements or expansions of the water and wastewater plants serving the city. These fees will only be used for the improvement or expansion of the water and wastewater treatment facilities located within the city. 
                  (c)  The aid-to-construction fee for commercial subdivisions and/or structures, and residential subdivisions and/or structures shall be calculated based on the estimated average daily water consumption of each type of structure or unit as outlined in Table 98-57.1, multiplied by the estimated construction cost per gallon, as listed in the fee ordinance, then multiplied by the number of units. If the proposed use is not included in Table 98-57.1, then the daily average water consumption rate shall be determined by the city manager and/or their designee. 
                  Owner/developer of any structure shall have the option of providing an Earthcraft or LEED certified facility that may modify the daily average water consumption rate as listed in Table 98-57.1. The aid-to-construction fee shall be the lower of the figures derived from using either the figures from Table 98-57.1, or the Leed or Earthcraft certified figures. The city will only accept certified LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) or Earthcraft figures from a current Georgia registered professional engineer or current Georgia registered architect. 
                  For example: For a 2011 development with 50 units of one-bedroom apartments the fee would be GPD (Table 98-57.1) x Cost Per Gallon x Unit Total = Aid-to-Construction Fee or 150 x $12.58 x 50 = $94,350.00 would be the aid-to-construction fee. 
                  (d)  Aid-to-construction fees for commercial or residential projects that do not require subdivision review and approval shall be paid with submittal of a request for a building permit. Aid-to-construction fees for commercial or residential subdivisions shall be paid prior to the receipt of a building permit for any structure. 
                  (e)  Additions and renovations made to existing structures shall pay an aid-to-construction fee based on the number of fixtures to be added. The fee shall be calculated based on ten units per fixture and then multiplied by the current estimated construction cost per gallon. 
                  Earthcraft and LEED certification may also be used for existing structures. The relocation of one or more fixtures within the same existing building envelope will not require an aid-to-construction fee.

                  b.  The building, structure, facility, or installation totally replaces the process or production equipment that causes the discharge of pollutants at an existing course; 
                  c.  The production processes or wastewater generating processes of the building, structure, facility, or installation are substantially independent of an existing source at the same site. In determining whether these are substantially independent, factors such as the extent to which the new facility is integrated with the existing plant, and the extent to which the new facility is engaged in the same general type of activity as the existing source, should be considered; or 
                  d.  Any remodeling or modification that results in a new facility as determined by the planning and building department. 
                  (2)  Construction on a site at which an existing source is located results in a modification rather than a new source if the construction does not create a new building, structure, facility, or installation meeting the criteria of subsection (1) above, but otherwise alters, replaces, or adds to existing process or production equipment. 
                  (3)  Construction of a new source as defined under this subsection has commenced if the owner or operator has: 
                  a.  Begun, or caused to begin, as part of a continuous on-site construction program any placement, assembly, or installation of facilities or equipment; or significant site preparation work including clearing, excavation, or removal of existing buildings, structures, or facilities which is necessary for the placement, assembly, or installation of new source facilities or equipment; or 
                  b.  Entered into a binding contractual obligation for the purchase of facilities or equipment, which are intended to be used in its operation within a reasonable time.

                  (5)  All waste shall only enter the grease interceptor through the inlet flow control device, then the inlet pipe. 
                  (6)  Where food-waste grinders are installed, the waste from those units shall discharge directly into the building drainage system without passing through a grease interceptor. Living quarters, as defined in this article, are exempted from this requirement. 
                  (Ord. of 2-25-08(2), § 1) 
                  Sec. 98-356. - Requirements for grease interceptors. 
                  (a)  All commercial and industrial facilities dealing with grease shall, at the permittees' expense and as required by the authority having jurisdiction: 
                  (1)  Provide an adequately sized grease interceptor. Requirements for grease trap sizing and the design criteria are provided in subsection (b). 
                  (2)  Locate the interceptor in a manner that provides ready and easy accessibility for cleaning and inspection. 
                  (3)  Obtain a written interceptor service agreement with a licensed transporter for a term of at least one year, or for the duration of the operation of the establishment, whichever is less, to maintain the interceptor in effective operating condition. A service agreement must be in effect as long as the facility has a grease trap permit. 
                  (4)  Unless otherwise specified by the authority having jurisdiction, service the interceptor every 30 days and maintain backup copies of trip tickets and a service log, on the premises of the facility, for at least three years. 
                  (5)  Report to the authority having jurisdiction monthly as defined in section 98-362. 
                  (6)  Allow demand inspection of the facility and of records by inspectors during reasonable hours. 
                  (b)  Requirements for grease trap sizing and design criteria. 
                  (1)  Introduction: Information contained within this document is based on standard industry practices and guidance found in both, the 2006 International Plumbing Code (IPC) Commentary, or latest edition, and the 2000 Uniform Plumbing Code (UPC), or latest edition, Appendix H. Size, type, and location of grease traps shall be in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions and the requirements of the City of St. Marys Code of Ordinances. 
                  (2)  Applicability: These requirements are applicable to all commercial food service establishments, including those that are undergoing: 
                  a.  New construction. 
                  b.  Interior remodeling to accommodate expansion or operational modifications. 
                  c.  Changes of ownership/occupancy. 
                  d.  Facilities, which may be experiencing difficulty in achieving compliance with maintenance and/or wastewater discharge limitations. 
                  (3)  Sizing requirements: Sizing methods described herein are intended as guidance in determining grease trap/interceptor sizes that will afford the city's sanitary sewer system (POTW) a minimum degree of protection against grease and other obstructing materials. Sizing determinations are based on operational data provided by business owners or their contractors. In approving a customer's plumbing or grease interceptor design, the city does not accept liability for the failure of a system to adequately treat wastewater to achieve effluent quality requirements specified under this article. It is the responsibility of the generator and/or contractors to insure the appropriate level of treatment necessary for compliance with environmental and wastewater regulations. Minimum acceptable grease trap/interceptor sizing shall be accomplished as follows: 
                  a.  Sizing according to formulas found in subsection (b)(4) below. 
                  b.  Where sizing formulas result in determination of a grease trap less than 1,000 gallons in capacity, this minimum size is recommended. However, under no circumstances should exterior grease traps less than 1,000 gallons be utilized. 
                  c.  In the circumstance of "single service kitchens" with no food preparation (heat/serve only), and which use only paper service items, a minimum 50 gallon per minute (gpm) flow rated, or 100 pound grease retention, mechanical grease trap may be used. In these instances, the grease trap is to be installed in an area separate from food handling area, and the trap must be readily accessible for cleaning and maintenance. (See subsection 98-356(b)(6), below.) 
                  (4)  Grease trap sizing formulas: It is the responsibility of the generator and his/her contractors to ensure that the wastewater discharged from their facility is in compliance with the city's discharge limitations. For the purpose of plans review, a general assessment of grease trap/interceptor design and size will be performed using the following formulas. (These formulas have been demonstrated as industry standards capable of achieving the city's discharge criteria when systems are maintained in proper conditions.) 
                  Method 1: Uniform Plumbing Code, Appendix H 
                  Number of meals x waste flow x retention x storage = Size requirement 
                  Per peak hour (1) rate (2) time (3) factor (4) (liquid capacity) 
                  Factors: 
                  (1)  Number of meals served at peak operating hour (seating capacity) x peak factor: 
                  a.  Where peak factor for fast food restaurant is ..... ..... 1.33 
                  b.  And, peak factor for all other food service types is ..... ..... 1.00 
                  (2)  Waste flow rate: 
                  a.  With dishwasher ..... ..... 6 gallon flow 
                  b.  Without dishwasher ..... ..... 5 gallon flow 
                  c.  Single service kitchen ..... ..... 2 gallon flow 
                  d.  Food waste disposer ..... ..... 1 gallon flow 
                  (3)  Retention times: 
                  a.  Commercial kitchen waste/dishwasher ..... ..... 2.5 hours 
                  b.  Single service kitchen/single serving ..... ..... 1.5 hours 
                  (4)  Storage factors: 
                  a.  Fully equipped commercial kitchen 8 hr operation ..... ..... = 1 
                  b.  16 hr operation ..... ..... = 2 
                  c.  24 hr operation ..... ..... = 3 
                  d.  Single service kitchen ..... ..... = 1.5 
                  Uniform Plumbing Code includes a built-in safety factor that can yield very large grease trap size specifications. At this time, the city is not requiring traps larger than 4,000 gallons. However, the decision to use a trap smaller than that specified by the formula and calculations above is to be addressed in the plan submission. 
                  Method 2: Five hour detention/peak flow 
                  A.  Gallons of water used per hour of operation 
                  B.  A x 0.75 = average "gray water" flow per hour 
                  C.  B x 1.9 peak flow factor 
                  D.  C x 5 hours detention = volume trap 
                  Required volume of trap = A x B x C x D 
                  (5)  Alternate sizing formulas/proposals. Facilities that propose the use of alternate sizing techniques and/or procedures that result in specifications that differ from calculated requirements (or are less than the minimum 1,000 gallon recommendation), must submit formulas and other bases to support proposed grease trap size/installation. Submission should also provide documentation of ability to meet effluent quality requirements. This proposal must be signed by a licensed plumbing contractor or engineer licensed in the State of Georgia. 
                  (6)  Construction/installation: All permitting, construction, and inspection activities must be completed in accordance with the St. Marys Subdivision Ordinance (No. 86) and Zoning Ordinance (No. 110). Additionally, the following specifications must be incorporated into grease trap design: 
                  a.  The grease interceptor shall be constructed with a minimum of two chambers or shall have a minimum of two tanks in series. If two chambered, the dividing wall must extend to within one foot of the bottom of the tank and within two inches of the top and be securely fastened to both sides. 
                  b.  There must be inlet and outlet tees made of schedule 40 PVC installed. The inlet tee should extend down approximately one-third the depth of the trap from the top and the outlet tee should be located 12 to 18 inches off of the bottom of the trap. 
                  c.  Grease traps are to be installed at a minimum distance of ten feet from sinks and dishwashers to allow for adequate cooling of wastewater. Water temperatures must be less than 140 degrees F, prior to entering grease trap. 
                  d.  All grease bearing waste streams should be routed through an appropriate grease trap/interceptor, including: three-compartment sinks, pot/pan sinks, soup kettles, handwashing sinks, dishwashers, mop sinks and floor drains. 
                  Notable exceptions: Drains that receive "clear waste" only, such as from ice machines, condensate from coils and drink stations, may be plumbed to the sanitary system without passing through the grease interceptor with the condition that the receiving drain is a "hub" type that is a minimum of two inches above the finished floor. 
                  e.  All exterior or recessed grease traps and interceptors are to be installed with an effluent sampling well, equivalent to: a. Parks Equipment Services Sample Well SWB-9; b. American Industrial Pre-Cast Products Test Well; or c. Uopnor Sample Well. Sample wells will have a 15-inch diameter access cover and a minimum four-inch drop from inlet to outlet piping through the sampling well. Mechanical grease traps and interceptors that are installed above ground must be equipped with an influent flow regulator and an effluent valve assembly that allows for sample collection. 
                  (7)  Customer (generator) responsibilities: It is the responsibility of the customer (waste generator) to insure compliance with the city discharge limitations. 
                  a.  Hazardous wastes, such as acids, strong cleaners, pesticides, herbicides, paint, solvents, or gasoline should not be disposed of where they would go through grease or grit traps. If commercial dishwashers are discharged through a grease interceptor, care must be taken in system design. Dishwashers use detergents and elevated water temperatures that will melt grease. If the interceptor is either too small or too close to the commercial dishwasher, grease may pass through the interceptor and into the collection system. 
                  b.  Generators are responsible for maintaining grease traps in continuous proper working condition. Further, generators are responsible for inspecting, repairing, replacing, or installing apparatus and equipment as necessary to ensure proper operation and function of grease traps and compliance with discharge limitations at all times. 
                  c.  The generator must have a grease trap/grease interceptor service contract (for pumping, cleaning, and inspection) by a city permitted vacuum truck cleaning service/waste hauler, at a minimum frequency of every 30 days to ensure proper function. The trap shall be maintained more frequently if needed to meet the city's discharge criteria. Records of maintenance are required to be submitted to the city monthly for inspection and maintained on-site for three years. (30-day maintenance frequency assumes proper sizing and installation consistent with this guidance). 
                  d.  Enzymes, solvents, and emulsifiers are not permitted, as they will only change the form of grease, allowing it to be carried out of the trap with the wastewater and deposited in the collection system (POTW). Biological treatment systems must be pre-approved by the authority having jurisdiction. These systems will not alleviate the necessity for inspection and proper maintenance. 
                  e.  It is the responsibility of the waste generator to assure that the commercial waste removed from the generators facility is properly treated and discharged to the sewer system, wastewater, sludge and byproducts are transported by a permitted transporter, and disposed of at an EPD approved commercial waste processing and disposal facility. The generator of commercial waste shall not allow a transporter to remove waste from their facility without a current waste transporter permit issued by the City of St. Marys.

                  Sec. 98-357. - Grease interceptor construction. 
                  (a)  Any person responsible for discharges requiring a grease interceptor shall, at his own expense and as required by the city, provide plans and specifications for equipment and facilities of a design type and design capacity approved by the inspection division of the planning and building department of the city. The grease interceptor must be in compliance with the current applicable city plumbing codes. The person shall locate the interceptor in a manner that provides easy accessibility for cleaning and inspection and maintain the interceptor in effective operating condition. The inspection division of the planning and building department shall inspect the interceptor during construction and upon completion. All interested parties, including the inspection division of the planning and building department and the authority having jurisdiction shall make a final inspection before any service connections are made. 
                  (b)  Construction of items listed herein in accordance herewith or in accordance to the city's specifications shall not constitute a defense to unlawful discharge and shall not limit the generator's liability for any surcharge stated in this article. 
                  (c)  If the authority having jurisdiction determines that there is a need for installation or upgrading of sample ports or grease interceptors on an existing establishment, the authority having jurisdiction may order the installation or upgrading of such interceptors on that existing establishment. If the authority having jurisdiction orders such installation, then the authority having jurisdiction shall serve notice of such order upon the grease generator. Within ten days of receipt of such order, the grease generator may demand a hearing to review such order, in which case the authority having jurisdiction shall schedule a hearing to review such order within 30 days of receiving the demand for review from the grease or grit generator. If a hearing to review the order is scheduled, the authority having jurisdiction shall serve notice of the hearing to review such order upon the grease generator at least ten days before the date of such hearing. At the hearing to review the order, the grease generator may present evidence, and the authority having jurisdiction may make new findings and issue new orders concerning the subject of the original hearing. After receiving notice of the order to install or upgrade ports or interceptors on an existing establishment, it shall be unlawful for a grease generator to allow or cause any discharge into the sanitary sewer not in compliance with such order. 
                  (d)  Where the process wastewaters are generated in only part of the facility, the process wastewaters may, at the option of the authority having jurisdiction, discharge into a grease interceptor servicing only those areas that provide a suitable sampling port. 
                  (e)  The authority having jurisdiction may waive the requirement for a grease interceptor provided the grease generator can verify that only domestic sewage is being discharged, with no floor drains or process water. The authority having jurisdiction may require testing by the user in connection with this request, with all costs for this testing being at the users expense.

                  (a)  Except for "under the sink grease interceptors", each interceptor shall be located outside of a building or structure in an area accessible for service, and so installed and connected that it shall be at all times easily accessible for inspection, and for cleaning and removal of the intercepted waste. Inlet flow control inspection ports, interceptor inspection ports, and effluent monitoring ports shall be in areas where vehicles may not temporarily block access to inspection. The use of ladders or the removal of bulky equipment or stored materials in order to inspect inlet flow control devices, inspect or service interceptors, or sample interceptor effluent shall constitute a violation of accessibility. Inspection ports and monitoring ports shall be located so as to allow inspectors quick and easy access to the inlet flow control device, each compartment of the interceptor, and the effluent from the interceptor. An interceptor shall not be installed in any part of a building where food is handled. The location of all interceptors, inspection ports, and monitoring ports shall meet the approval of the authority having jurisdiction and shall be shown on the approved building plans. 
                  (b)  An inspection port shall be provided for the flow control device regulating flow into the interceptor. 
                  (c)  A one-piece removable metal plate covering the entire interceptor shall be preferred as an interceptor inspection port, though at the discretion of the authority having jurisdiction, standard manhole ports may be installed over each divider in the interceptor, but in either case all parts of the interceptor shall be easily accessible for cleaning and visual inspection. 
                  (d)  A monitoring port shall be provided for ease in sampling the treated effluent from the interceptor and shall be as close as possible to the connection with the city POTW within the bounds of the facility property. The port shall be installed according to the specifications of the authority having jurisdiction. The port shall be installed and maintained at the user's expense. A generator shall properly place, monitor, and maintain the monitoring port so that wastewater samples taken from the monitoring port are representative of wastewater leaving the interceptor. It shall be unlawful for a grease generator to divert sewage around a monitoring point into the POTW. 
                  (Ord. of 2-25-08(2), § 1) 
                  Sec. 98-359. - Under the sink grease interceptors. 
                  (a)  In the event that an outside grease interceptor is not practicable, an "under the sink grease interceptor" may be installed subject to the approval of the inspection division of the planning and building department. In addition to the regular requirements of grease interceptors, "under the sink grease interceptors" are subject to the additional requirements. 
                  (b)  General requirements. 
                  (1)  The location of such interceptors shall be in as close proximity to the source of wastewater as physically possible. 
                  (2)  The lid shall be secured to the body with a single bolt. No wing nuts or screws shall be permitted. 
                  (3)  Baffle systems and all other internal pieces shall be removable to facilitate cleaning and replacement, but must be in place at all other times. 
                  (4)  The lid shall cover the deep seal trap. The deep seal trap shall be constructed so as to eliminate the possibility of sewer gas entering the kitchen area. 
                  (5)  The interceptors shall be constructed with bottom supports so that the body of the interceptor does not corrode by coming into contact with the floor. 
                  (6)  The interceptor shall be coated with a powder-coated electrostatically applied cathodic epoxy coating so as to be resistant to corrosion. 
                  (7)  The interceptor shall be equipped with a flow control fitting. 
                  (c)  Installation requirements. 
                  (1)  The interceptor may be set on the floor, partially recessed in the floor with top flush with the floor, or fully recessed below the floor to suit piping and structural conditions, as acceptable by the inspection division of the planning and building department. 
                  (2)  There shall be sufficient clearance for the removal of the interceptor cover for cleaning. 
                  (3)  Unless specifically approved by the inspection division of the planning and building department, runs of pipe exceeding 25 feet between fixture and interceptor shall not be permitted. 
                  (4)  The interceptor shall not be installed in a waste line from a garbage grinder. Any garbage grinder waste shall bypass the interceptor. 
                  (5)  A suitable flow control fitting shall be installed ahead of the interceptor in the waste line beyond the fixture and as close as possible to the underside of the lowest fixture. When wastes of two or more sinks or fixtures are combined to be used by one interceptor, a single flow control fitting shall be used. 
                  (6)  Air intake for flow control either shall terminate under the sink drain board as high as possible to prevent overflow, or shall terminate in a return bend at the same height and on the outside of the building. 
                  (7)  To retain water and prevent siphoning, all interceptors shall have a vented waste, sized in accordance with the plumbing code of the city. 
                  (8)  With the approval of the inspection division of the planning and building department, one interceptor may be used to serve multiple fixtures if the fixtures are located close together and the interceptor is sized to meet the combined flow of all the fixtures. 
                  (d)  Maintenance requirements. 
                  (1)  Interceptors shall be serviced at least every week by a permitted vacuum truck cleaning service/waste hauler. After accumulated grease and waste has been removed, the interceptor shall be thoroughly inspected to make certain that inlet, outlet, and air relief ports are clear of obstructions. 
                  (2)  Grease and other waste removed from the interceptor shall not be introduced into any drain, sewer, or natural body of water. The waste shall be placed in proper containers for proper disposal. It shall not be mixed with "edible" grease. Grease and waste removed from an interceptor shall not be disposed of in such a matter so as to become food for animals or humans. 
                  (3)  The grease generator shall maintain adequate documentation that the interceptor is appropriately cleaned and inspected. 
                  (Ord. of 2-25-08(2), § 1) 
                  Sec. 98-360. - Interceptor maintenance. 
                  (a)  Interceptor maintenance service contract. 
                  (1)  All grease generators having interceptors shall perform all business transactions relating to interceptor pumping, cleaning, and servicing, and to liquid waste collection, transportation and/or disposal on a contractual basis via a written contract having duration of at least one year, and provide copies of all such contracts to the authority having jurisdiction. Any modifications or changes to the contract must be submitted to the authority having jurisdiction within ten working days of the change or modification. It is a violation for a grease generator to discharge through an interceptor without a service contract. 
                  (2)  A contract shall include at a minimum: 
                  a.  From the customer: 
                  1.  Contain the customer name, address and telephone number, and the name, address, and telephone number of the facility to be serviced if different.

                  iii.  Certificate of indemnification. 
                  c.  Other. Contain a statement of the duration of the contract, to be not less than one year, or for the duration of the operation of the facility, whichever is less. 
                  (b)  Required pumping frequency. 
                  (1)  Unless otherwise specified by the authority having jurisdiction, each interceptor in active use shall be cleaned at least once every month or more frequently as needed to prevent carry over of grease into the POTW, unless it can be demonstrated to the authority having jurisdiction that the pumping frequency can be performed at greater intervals. The authority having jurisdiction may specify cleaning more frequently when monthly pumping is shown to be inadequate. Additional pumping may be required during time periods where increased loading is anticipated. Any grease generator desiring a schedule less frequent than monthly shall submit a request to the authority having jurisdiction along with testing (as required by the authority having jurisdiction) and copies of the cleaning records for the last four interceptor cleanings, including measurements of the thickness of the surface scum/grease layer. 
                  (2)  At any time if an inspection finds the interceptor to be full, immediate steps shall be taken by the grease generator to pump out and clean it as soon as is practicable. The inspector shall make an evaluation of the advisability of allowing discharge to continue, and may at his or her discretion order an immediate cessation of all discharge from the facility. In any case, the wastewater discharge permit of the facility may be amended so as to compel more frequent pumping and cleaning of the interceptor. 
                  (c)  All interceptors shall be maintained by the grease generator at the grease generator's expense. 
                  (d)  Requirement for increased pumpage or servicing. If the authority having jurisdiction finds that a change in pumpage or servicing of an interceptor is necessary for an establishment to meet the discharge limits stated in this article, the authority having jurisdiction may order a change in pumpage or servicing of an interceptor. If the authority having jurisdiction orders a change in the pumpage or servicing, then the authority having jurisdiction shall serve notice of such order upon the generator. Within ten days of receipt of such order, the generator may demand a hearing to review such order, in which case the authority having jurisdiction shall schedule a hearing to review such order within 30 days of receiving the demand for review from the generator. If a hearing to review the order is scheduled, the authority having jurisdiction shall serve notice of the hearing to review such order at least ten days before the date of such hearing. At the hearing to review the order, the generator may present evidence, and the authority having jurisdiction may make new findings and issue new orders concerning the subject of the original hearing. After receiving notice of an order by the authority having jurisdiction to change the frequency and/or methods of pumpage or servicing, it shall be unlawful for a generator to allow or cause any discharge into the sanitary sewer (POTW) not in compliance with such order. 
                  (e)  Interceptor maintenance log. 
                  (1)  Every generator having an interceptor shall maintain an interceptor maintenance log indicating each pumping for the previous 12 months. This log shall include the date, time, amount pumped, hauler and disposal site, and shall be kept in a conspicuous location on the premises of the facility for inspection. Food service establishments shall keep the log posted with their Camden County Environmental Health Food Permit. Said log shall be made immediately available to any authorized city inspector. 
                  (2)  The information required in the maintenance log must be submitted to the authority having jurisdiction annually. The reporting period shall be January 1 through December 31 of each year. The report shall be submitted within 30 days after the end of the reporting period to the authority having jurisdiction. 
                  (f)  Cleaning procedures. 
                  (1)  The owner or an employee of the facility shall supervise the interceptor cleaning, and shall be physically present and observe the entire cleaning operation. 
                  (2)  A generator shall cause the liquid waste hauler, transporter, or any other person cleaning or servicing an interceptor to completely evacuate all contents, including floating materials, wastewater, and bottom sludges and solids, of all grease and/or grit interceptors and other interceptors during servicing. Skimming the surface layer of waste material, partial cleaning of the interceptor or use of any method that does not remove the entire contents of the collection device is prohibited. The suction of the floating materials shall be done prior to removal of other contents. After complete evacuation, the walls, top, and bottom of the interceptor shall then be thoroughly scraped and the residue removed. The interceptor shall then be steam cleaned and the residue removed. Upon completion of the servicing, the manager of the facility shall make an inspection of the interior of the interceptor and then personally sign the trip ticket. The manager shall make an appropriate entry in the facility interceptor maintenance log, and post the generator section of the trip ticket in a conspicuous place with the log on the premises. Food service establishments shall keep all trip tickets posted with their Camden County Environmental Health Food Permit. Said trip tickets and maintenance logs shall be made immediately available to any authorized city inspector. 
                  (3)  It shall be unlawful for a generator to allow, the discharge of liquid, semi-solids, or solids back into an interceptor during and/or after servicing. Decanting or discharging of removed waste back into the interceptor from which the waste was removed or any other interceptor, for the purpose of reducing the volume to be disposed, is prohibited. 
                  (4)  Each interceptor pumped shall be fully evacuated unless the interceptor volume is greater than the tank capacity on the vacuum truck in which case the transporter shall arrange for additional transportation capacity so that the interceptor is fully evacuated within a 24-hour period following the transporter's inability to fully evacuate the interceptor. 
                  (g)  Disposal of interceptor pumpage. All waste removed from each interceptor shall be disposed of at a facility permitted and authorized to receive such waste in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations. In no way shall the pumpage be returned to any private or public portion of the POTW, without prior written approval from the authority having jurisdiction, nor may it be returned to any portion of the POTW not specifically designated by the public works superintendent. Additionally, grease removed from an interceptor shall not be recycled so as to become a food product or part of a food product for animal or human consumption. 
                  (h)  Vacuum truck cleaning service. It shall be unlawful for a grease or grit generator to allow grease or grit interceptor waste to be removed from his premises by a transporter who does not have all applicable federal, state, or local permits or registrations, including at a minimum a vacuum truck cleaning service occupation tax certificate from the authority having jurisdiction, and a Georgia EPD waste hauler's permit.

                  Sec. 98-361. - Permit requirements. 
                  (a)  It is unlawful for any facility to discharge effluent from a grease interceptor without authorization from the authority having jurisdiction. Authorization shall be given in the form of a "grease interceptor permit." Application for a permit shall be made to the authority having jurisdiction. If, after examining the information contained in the grease interceptor permit application, it is determined by the authority having jurisdiction that the proposed discharge does not conflict with the provisions of this article, or any other federal, state, or local requirement or regulation, and the permit fee is paid, a permit shall be issued allowing the facility to discharge into the POTW. Each grease interceptor permit shall be issued for a time not longer than one year from the date of the permit. The grease generator shall apply for permit reissuance prior to the expiration of the grease generator's existing permit. The terms and conditions of the permit may be subject to modification by the authority having jurisdiction at any time during the term of the permit as limitations or requirements as identified in this chapter are modified or other just causes exist. The grease generator shall be informed of any proposed changes in the issued permit at least 30 days prior to the effective date of the change(s). Any changes or new conditions in the permit shall include a reasonable time schedule for compliance. 
                  (b)  A commercial waste transporter permit is required by the city for all vehicles involved in the transport of commercial waste to a disposal facility. However, prior to obtaining a commercial waste transporter permit from the city, the transporter must first register as a transporter of commercial waste with the EPD and obtain a transporter registration number. This registration number must be included in the permit number issued by the city. 
                  (c)  A transporter permit fee will be assessed on an annual basis at a rate of $250.00 for the first truck and $100.00 for each additional truck, payable to the City of St. Marys. Any commercial waste transporter permit issued by a local governing authority for operation of a tank truck shall be valid throughout the state. 
                  (d)  As a condition precedent to the granting of a permit, the permittee under this section will agree to hold harmless the city and the city's employees from any liabilities arising from the permit holder's operations under this permit.

                  Editor's note— An ordinance (2) adopted Feb. 26, 2007, § 1, amended Art. II in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former Art. II, §§ 102-26—102-39, pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from §§ 1—12 of an ordinance adopted Oct. 18, 1983; an ordinance adopted Feb. 21, 1984; and § 1 of an ordinance adopted July 24, 2006. 

                  Sec. 102-26.A - Purpose and intent. 
                  The city deems it necessary and desirable in the interest of public health, safety and welfare to enact an ordinance for the conservation, planting and replacement of trees and to prevent the indiscriminate removal of trees in the city without denying the reasonable use and enjoyment of real property. The importance of trees is recognized for their shade, cooling, noise and wind reduction, soil erosion prevention, oxygen production, dust filtration, carbon dioxide absorption, aesthetic and economic enhancement of all real property, and their contribution to the general well being and quality of life of the citizens of St. Marys. Consistent with the expressed purpose of this article, all persons shall make reasonable efforts to preserve and retain certain existing, self-supporting trees as defined herein. It is also the intent of this article that all applicable sites within the city maintain or obtain a 50 percent minimum tree canopy, as defined and explained herein. 
                  (Ord. of 2-26-07(2), § 1) 
                  Sec. 102-26.B - Applicability. 
                  The provision of this article shall apply in all areas of the city except those areas of the city which are presently developed as single-family and multifamily residential. Areas that fall into the historic district must still comply with the regulations that cover this area. 
                  Other than property in the historic district, lots owned by individuals shall not be governed by this article after development of the residential subdivision or commercial subdivision is complete and the owner has a warranty deed granted to the owner. 
                  (Ord. of 2-26-07(2), § 1) 
                  Sec. 102-27. - Minimum canopy requirements. 
                  (a)  A basic condition of the City of St. Marys Tree Management Ordinance is that all applicable sites maintain a minimum tree canopy of 50 percent. Applicable sites for this section are land upon which: 
                  (1)  A residential subdivision of more than five lots (including planned developments) is being developed; 
                  (2)  A commercial subdivision of more than five lots (including planned development) is being developed; 
                  (3)  Any activity requiring issuance of a land disturbance permit is carried out; 
                  (4)  Public land. 
                  The canopy requirement must be met whether or not a site had trees prior to development or disturbance of the applicable site. The canopy may be achieved by preserving existing trees, by planting new trees according to the minimum standards in this article or by a combination of the two. Minimum tree canopy shall be calculated and established pursuant to the formula and analysis set forth in section 102-44 to this article. Any existing tree of not less than six inches DBH left in good growing condition on the property is eligible to be counted toward the minimum required canopy and has to be protected. The property owner shall be subject to the minimum tree canopy requirement set forth in this section. The property owner shall base the canopy calculation on the gross site area. 
                  (b)  Trees replanted to achieve canopy requirements are to be selected species from the City of St. Marys Tree Species Selection List set forth in sections 102-48 through 102-50, (which will list values of canopy coverage in square feet for various groups of trees and minimum area for planting), on file with the city. In addition, replanting shall be at the ratio of not less than one overstory tree for every three understory trees. Canopy credit may be met by planting all overstory trees, but not by planting only understory trees. No more than 40 percent of any one genus may be included in any replanting plan. All replacement trees will be maintained properly to ensure their survivability. 
                  (Ord. of 2-26-07(2), § 1) 
                  Sec. 102-28.A - Trees approved for removal. 
                  (a)  Canopy recovery for development plans. 
                  (1)  Development plans shall include a canopy recovery plan for replacement of trees and vegetation approved for removal. A canopy recovery plan shall include the following: 
                  a.  Areas to be cleared and areas preserved; 
                  b.  The number of trees required for replacement, to achieve 50 percent canopy. 
                  (2)  In order to promote diversity, no more than 15 percent of the replacement trees shall be of the same species; 
                  (3)  Where the planning director and tree board determines that a site cannot sustainably support the required replacement, due to the size and shape and/or structures and/or other viable site constraints, a fee shall be paid to the City of St. Marys Tree Fund. This fee shall be the actual and verified cost of the required tree replacement and shall be submitted prior to the issuance of a land disturbance permit or building permit; and 
                  (4)  If a property owner has preserved extensive overstory trees and clusters of native trees and vegetation, in such a manner as to provide extensive shading within the built environment, value shall be 100 percent of the drip line area of groupings. An exhibit depicting the aforementioned shall be submitted that calculates the canopy spread based on DBH and species of a tree. (See Diagram 1 illustration).

                  Sec. 102-28.B - Heritage tree. 
                  (a)  The City of St. Marys residents have long enjoyed an abundance and diversity of trees and forests. These have served as resources for shelter and products, shaded homes and streets, and immeasurably added to the aesthetic character of towns and neighborhoods. Many urban trees have been associated with historic events or sites or have been planted by individuals or groups commemorating special events or community leaders. 
                  (b)  The City of St. Marys Heritage Tree Register will recognize noteworthy trees or groves of trees and acknowledge the significance selected individual trees or stands have had to our communities. It is the intent of this section that this process of identifying and publicly noting significant (heritage) trees and maintaining the register listings with accurate historical and current data should result in appropriate maintenance and adequate consideration being given to the status of trees as urban assets of particular vulnerability in changing urban areas. 
                  (c)  Heritage trees are individual trees or groves of trees of any size or species that are specially designated as heritage because of their historical, commemorative, or horticultural significance. The list of designated heritage trees remains open for new designations and provides useful information to the planning and zoning staff regarding the importance of their actions while planning activities near heritage trees. 
                  (d)  To be considered heritage, a nominated tree or grove of trees must be located in the City of St. Marys, be alive and healthy, not pose a threat to public safety, not pose a threat of distributing invasive exotic seed or invasive exotic vegetative reproductive structures, and must provide cultural or historic value. The tree's owner must agree to have the tree or grove designated as heritage. The property owner must pay any fees associated with determining the health of the tree. This assessment must be performed by a regional forester or designated city arborist or staff. 
                  (e)  City of St. Marys shall compile a list of heritage trees, which may also include the oldest, tallest, largest and rarest native and exotic tree species growing in the city. 
                  (f)  Anyone may nominate a heritage tree by contacting the city arborist or designated city staff. Upon nomination by any person and with the written consent of the property owner(s), the city may designate a tree or trees as a heritage tree. After city approval of a heritage tree designation, the city arborist or designated city staff, shall notify the property owner(s) in writing. 
                  (g)  No tree on private property can be designated without the consent of the current property owner. Once designated by current owner as a heritage tree, this ordinance further states that it is unlawful for any person, without prior written permit from the city planning department, to remove, destroy, cut, prune, break or injure any heritage tree. The heritage tree designation will run with the land. No heritage tree designation can be removed without approval of the city council. 
                  (Ord. of 5-10-10(2), § 3) 
                  Sec. 102-29. - Alternative compliance to canopy density requirement. 
                  (a)  The intent of this article is to ensure that a minimum canopy density of trees is maintained on all applicable sites, as defined in this article. If this intent cannot be met because a site will not bear the required density of trees, as determined by the planning director and the St. Marys Tree Board, alternative methods of compliance may be approved: 
                  (1)  Planting at a location remote from the project site. If trees are to be planted at another location, a tree replacement plan, meeting all applicable standards, must be reviewed and approved. The following note must be shown on the approved plan: "A tree replacement plan addendum for this project shall be submitted to the City Arborist or designated city staff for the City of St. Marys in conjunction with the construction plans for the proposed activity. This plan shall include the species, size and location of trees to be planted off-site to meet the tree density deficit shown. Final acceptance of this project is subject to approval of this plan, as well as verification of the installation of the trees". 
                  (2)  Contributing to the City of St. Marys Tree Bank. 
                  a.  The City of St. Marys will accept donations to the City of St. Marys Tree Bank. These donations will be used for the sole purpose of planting trees on public property within the City of St. Marys. For calculating contributions to the City of St. Marys Tree Bank, see section 102-45 of this article. 
                  b.  The City of St. Marys Tree Bank will be administered by the St. Marys Tree Board, or designated city staff. An annual report shall be submitted to the city manager showing amounts collected, amounts spent, and the type and location of trees planted. 
                  (b)  The city arborist or designated city staff must review and approve all requests for alternative compliance. In no instance shall more than 80 percent of the required site canopy be met through alternative compliance. As many trees as can reasonably be expected to survive must be planted on the site in question. 
                  (c)  No development approval (as defined by this article), land disturbance permit, or building permit shall be issued until the city arborist or designated city staff has approved the request and received the necessary documentation and/or funds for the compliance method. 
                  (Ord. of 2-26-07(2), § 1; Ord. of 5-10-10(2), § 4) 
                  Sec. 102-30. - Tree maintenance for public protected trees. 
                  (a)  Pruning and trimming. All trees designated for trimming shall be trimmed in accordance with the International Society of Arboriculture Standards and the following standards: 
                  (1)  Trees trimmed for clearance from utility lines may be trimmed in such a manner as to provide clearance from lines for a designated period of time or cycle, not to exceed two years. In all cases where conditions permit, drop crotch or side trimming methods shall be used to obtain necessary clearance. Topping is prohibited. The individual or business trimming the tree is responsible for the disposal of wood residue and trimmed parts of the tree to include chips, logs and limbs. 
                  (2)  Whenever trimming harms the visual shape of the tree, additional trimming shall be performed to achieve satisfactory shape and appearance. Where possible, all cuts shall be of appropriate cut taken back to the trunk of the tree, in order to eliminate excessive sprouts and unsightly stubs. All cuts shall be made in a manner that prevents rips to the bark. 
                  (3)  Thinning and pruning of a mature tree that exceeds more than 25 percent of the leaf surface, on both the lateral branch and the overall foliage that is pruned within a growing season is prohibited. 
                  (Ord. of 2-26-07(2), § 1) 
                  Sec. 102-31. - Tree protection plan. 
                  The tree protection plan shall be a detailed plan designed to protect and preserve trees before, during and for a period of two years after construction. Any trees designated for retention on the tree protection plan that die or are severely damaged within the first two years after construction shall be replaced in accordance with this article. These replacement trees shall be maintained for a minimum of two consecutive years after planting or replacement. 
                  Tree protection barriers shall be erected around all existing trees to be preserved to meet standards set by the International Society of Arboriculture, Georgia Forestry Commission, and the city's requirements for protection of street trees or other trees required by city tree ordinance (see section 102-47). 
                  (Ord. of 2-26-07(2), § 1) 
                  Sec. 102-32. - Exceptions. 
                  The planning director and building official, utilizing such other technical assistance as it may require, shall review the application and plot plan and shall consider and determine what effect it will have upon the drainage, topography and natural resources of the area, and shall consider these factors in granting or denying the application. Exceptions are as follows: 
                  (1)  If any tree shall be determined to be in a hazardous or dangerous condition so as to endanger the public health, welfare or safety, and requires immediate removal without delay, verbal authorization may be given by the city manager, building official, street supervisor, fire chief or police chief, and the tree removed without obtaining a permit as herein required. 
                  (2)  During the period of an emergency, such as a tornado, ice storm, flood or any other act of nature, the requirements of this article may be waived by the mayor or his designee. 
                  (3)  All licensed plant or tree nurseries or tree farms shall be exempt from the terms and provisions of this article only in relation to those trees which are planted and growing for sale or intended sale to the general public in the ordinary course of business, or for some public purpose; and persons, firms, organizations, corporations or societies in the business of growing trees for commercial purpose on their own land or on the land leased to them, shall be exempt. 
                  (4)  Any tree less than 12 inches DBH is exempted from section 102-30. 
                  (5)  Any lot after development of the residential subdivision or commercial subdivision is complete and the owner has a warranty deed granted to the owner shall be exempt from section 102-31.

                  Bonds,  as required by this section, shall be in the form of letters of credit, certificates of deposit, cash bond, bonds issued by an insurance company legally doing business in the State of Georgia, or other acceptable means agreeable to the city attorney. The letters of credit and certificates of deposit shall be drawn upon banks or savings and loans legally and actually doing business in Georgia. Such bonds must meet the approval of the city attorney's office. This bond shall be in addition to any other bond required by any other government entity. 
                  (1)  Bonds shall be required for licenses involving the replacement of ten or more trees, or the relocation of five or more trees, or the relocation of any tree with a DBH of ten inches or greater. 
                  (2)  Calculations for the amount of bonds shall be computed based upon the equivalent canopy replacement criteria applied to each tree to be relocated or replaced, as provided in section 102-27, and upon the cost of installation and maintenance. The fair market value of the cost of trees that would be required to compensate for the canopy to be relocated or replaced shall be posted. The bond period shall be for the tree replacement performance period of two full growing periods, as stated in the license or as extended or released, plus an additional 60 days. The form of security shall be reviewed by the city's attorney's office for legal sufficiency and may not be accepted until approved. 
                  (3)  Release of bonds. 
                  a.  Upon successful tree relocation and replacement as determined by this section and written approval by city engineer or designated representative, bonds required for tree relocation and replacement shall be released. Where possible, bonds shall be partially released for partially successful relocation/replacement projects, with the amount retained equal to the value of the additional replacement trees required, plus installation and maintenance. 
                  b.  Bonds may be released by the city when fee simple title is transferred. The city may condition the release of the bond upon the establishment of a new bond by the new owner in fee simple. 
                  (4)  Where the licensee plants 50 percent more than the required number of replacement trees and establishes a suitable maintenance plan to ensure the viability of the replacement trees, city engineer may recognize the additional replacement trees as suitable security in lieu of a bond. 
                  (5)  Governmental entities shall be exempt from the requirement of providing bonds.

                  Sec. 102-44. - Canopy analysis. 
                  A basic condition of the city tree protection ordinance is that all applicable sites have a potential minimum canopy of 50 percent by area. The canopy requirement must be met whether or not a site had trees prior to development. The canopy may be achieved by counting existing trees to be preserved or actual canopy pf preserved trees or groupings, planting new trees, or some combination of the two. For canopy analysis, the following formula shall apply: 
                  CR = SA × 0.5 
                  Where: 
                  CR = canopy area requirement 
                  SA = site area 
                    
                  PROCEDURE FOR CALCULATING THE  REQUIRED TREE REPLACEMENT: 
                  Step 1: Area of total site from boundary survey. 
                  Step 2: Divide area (in square feet) by two. 
                  Step 3: Subtract preserved tree area from step 2. 
                  Step 4: Select enough overstory and understory trees to equal area in step 3. (Note: Not more than three understory trees for each overstory tree. Not more than 15 percent of one species and not more than 40 percent of one genus.) 
                  NOTE: All replacement trees must be two inch caliper or greater. Replacement trees must have minimum area for growth. Sections 102-48—102-50 (include minimum tree planting area in the tree list). 
                  Square footage value placed on a two-inch caliber tree for calculating replacement trees: 
                  a.  Overstory trees values: 
                  1.  Large growth trees = 1,500 sq. ft./tree planted. 
                  2.  Medium growth trees = 550 sq. ft./tree planted. 
                  b.  Understory trees value: 
                  1.  Small growth trees = 250 sq. ft./tree planted. 
                  Example 1: Following site to be developed: 
                  Step 1: Ten acre site = 435,600 sq. ft. 
                  Step 2: 50 percent canopy cover figure. 
                  435,600 ;div; 2 = 217,800 sq. ft. to meet 50 percent canopy cover. 
                  Step 3: Preserved trees left on site = 108,900 sq. ft. (2.5 acres). 
                  217,800 minus 108,900 = 108,900 sq. ft. of replacement trees. 
                  Step 4: Replacement trees required to meet 50 percent CR (canopy area requirement). 
                  CR = canopy area requirement 
                  108,900 sq. ft. of area to be planted in trees. 
                  a.  Overstory trees = 1,500 sq. ft./tree for large canopy trees planted. 
                  b.  Overstory trees = 550 sq. ft./tree for medium canopy tree planted. 
                  1.  65 overstory (large canopy trees) x 1500 sq. ft. = 97,500 sq. ft. 
                  2.  15 overstory (medium canopy trees) x 550 sq. ft. = 8,250 sq. ft. 
                  3.  Total sq. ft. 105,750 sq. ft. 
                  c.  Understory trees = 250 sq. ft./tree planted. 
                  1.  13 understory (small canopy trees) x 250 sq. ft. = 3,250 sq. ft. 
                  c.  Total square footage of trees planted: 109,000 sq. ft. 
                  THE 109,000 SQ, FT. OF PLANTED TREES HAS MET 50 PERCENT CANOPY AREA REQUIREMENT. 
                  (Ord. of 2-26-07(2), § 1(App. C)) 
                  Sec. 102-45. - City tree bank formula for determining contributions. 
                  Contribution calculations are based on two-inch caliper replacement trees with a value updated semi-annually, and on file with the city, representing the average size and cost of materials, labor and guarantee for trees planted in the City of St. Marys area. 
                  Example: Based on unit value of tree replacement of $500.00 (amount subject to change). 
                  To determine the appropriate CR contribution, first calculate the implantable square footage (ISF) of tree space which cannot be planted on the site. 
                  Divide the ISF by 1,500 sq. ft. (the sq. ft. value of a 2-inch caliper overstory replacement tree) and multiply by $500.00. 
                  Example 2: From Example 1 the total sq. ft. of 50% CR required is 108,900 sq. ft. 
                  Due to space limitation and other site problems, the site only has 84,500 sq. ft. of Plantable Area (PA) for replacement trees. 
                  To determine the CR trees not plantable on site use the following formula: 
                  USF = CR - PA 
                  In this example: 
                  CR (108,900 sq. ft.) - PA (84,500 sq. ft.) = 24,400 sq. ft. of ISF 
                  CR = ISF ;div; 1500 sq. ft. 
                  CR = 24,400 ;div; 1500 sq. ft. = 16.266 replacement trees 
                  This means that a total of 16 trees are to be planted at a remote site as a form of alternative compliance or the developer may elect to contribute to the city tree bank the value of 16 trees. 
                  Determine the acceptable contribution amount as follows: 
                  16 x $500.00 = $8,000 TOTAL CONTRIBUTION TO TREE BANK 
                  (Ord. of 2-26-07(2), § 1(App. D)) 
                  Sec. 102-46. - Planting specifications. 
                  Trees shall conform to the American Standard for Nursery Stock for proper relations of height, caliper and root ball diameter. 
                  (1)  The diameter of the planting hole shall be a minimum of three times the diameter of the root ball. 
                  (2)  The planting hole sidewalls shall be scored or roughened to eliminate the smooth, slick surface caused by the shovel or auger. 
                  (3)  If containerized material is to be planted, any circling roots shall be cut by slicing the root ball vertically from top to bottom in two to three well spaced lines around the root ball with a sharp knife, except in the case of any species of palms (see appendix). 
                  (4)  The root ball shall rest on undisturbed soil in the planting hole with the top of the root ball on level with the natural ground level or slightly raised (not to exceed a height of two inches above the natural ground level). 
                  (5)  Any tree planted with the top of the root ball below natural ground level shall not be counted towards the required canopy replacement for the property. 
                  (6)  The soil used to backfill around the root ball shall be uncompacted, native soil free of rocks, trash, or any construction debris. 
                  (7)  Stakes and guy wires should only be installed when absolutely necessary. Supporting devices shall not interfere with vehicular or pedestrian movement and shall be removed after 12 months. 
                  (8)  Mulch in the form of pine straw, pine bark or wood chips shall be evenly distributed over the planting hole to a settled depth of two inches. 
                  (9)  Permanent built-in or temporary watering systems shall be installed to ensure the plants will survive the critical establishment period. 
                  (10)  Out-of-season planting is discouraged. Property owners/developers may submit a "request for delay affidavit" to allow for plant installation to occur at a time which better coincides with the normal planting season (November l to March 31).

                  (1)  Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately following street or highway centerlines, or street or highway right-of-way lines, said boundaries shall be construed as following such lines. 
                  (2)  Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately following lot lines, said boundaries shall be construed as following such lines. 
                  (3)  Where district boundaries are indicated as being approximately parallel to the centerlines or right-of-way lines of streets, or the centerlines or right-of-way lines of highways, such district boundaries shall be construed as being parallel thereto at the scaled distance indicated on the zoning map. 
                  (4)  All streets, alleys, and railroad rights-of-way, if not otherwise specifically designated, shall be deemed to be in the same zone as the property immediately abutting upon such alleys, streets, or railroad right-of-way. Where the centerline of a street, alley or railroad right-of-way serves as a district boundary the zoning of such street, alley, or railroad right-of-way, unless otherwise specifically designated, shall be deemed to be the same as that of the abutting property up to such centerline. 
                  (5)  Boundaries indicated as following railroad lines shall be construed to be midway between the main tracks. 
                  (6)  Boundaries indicated as following salt water shorelines shall be construed to follow the mean low water mark of said shorelines, and in the event of change, the boundary line shall be construed as moving with the actual low water line; boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerline of fresh water rivers, creeks, canals, lakes, inlets or other bodies of water shall be construed to follow such centerlines. 
                  (7)  Where physical or cultural features existing on the ground are at variance with those shown on the official zoning map, the planning commission shall interpret the district boundaries. 
                  (8)  Where a district boundary line divides a lot which was in single ownership at the time of passage of this chapter, the planning commission may permit the extension of the regulations for either portion of the lot not to exceed 75 feet beyond the district line into the remaining portion of the lot. 
                  (9)  It is the policy of the planning commission that all fresh and salt water marsh areas fall within the Conservation-Preservation Land Use District (CP). Where a boundary is indicated as following such fresh or salt marsh area the boundary line shall be construed as following the actual limits of said fresh or salt marsh.

                  (e)  PSM-GD General Design Criteria and Development Standards. 
                  (1)  Overall site design should be harmonious in terms of landscaping, enclosure of principal and accessory uses, sizes and street patterns, and use relationships. 
                  (2)  Variety in building types, heights, placement on lots and size of open spaces are encouraged if they are conducive to a safe, healthy and aesthetically pleasing living environment. 
                  (3)  The average density for residential dwelling units in a PD District should not exceed those set forth in the R-2 District, although it may be clustered within the PD District. 
                  (4)  A buffer strip with plant cover trees and/or an attractive fence should be provided by the PD District, unless the adjoining use is compatible. For instance, when one family and multifamily dwellings within a PD District are on property adjoining an R-3 District, then no buffer shall be required. 
                  (5)  Within a PD District, the design should include buffers suitable for screening residential areas from commercial or industrial uses when dangers of incompatibility exist. 
                  (6)  The parking regulations of this chapter should be accepted as minimum standards, and therefore creative improvements are encouraged. 
                  (7)  Shopping centers and other types of planned developments shall not have more than two access points to any one public street, unless unusual circumstances dictate the need for additional access points. 
                  (8)  All access points from a PD District should be located at least 100 feet from the intersection of any street. 
                  (9)  Proposed cemeteries must be a minimum of ten acres and must otherwise comply in all respects with O.C.G.A. § 10-14-01 et seq. together with all rules and regulations promulgated by the Secretary of State of Georgia. 
                  (f)  PSM-SP Special Permit Uses. The uses listed under the various land use districts (article II, division 2) as "special permit uses" are so classified because they more intensely dominate the area in which they are located than do other uses which are called permitted uses. Special permit uses are uses which would not normally be appropriate in a district unless strictly controlled as to size, lot coverage, impact on public services, visibility, traffic and other such characteristics. The following procedure is established to integrate the special permit uses with other land uses located in the district. These uses shall be reviewed and authorized or rejected under the following procedure: 
                  (1)  When applying for a building permit, the applicant shall be informed by the planning and zoning director that the proposed use is a special permit use. The matter will then be referred to the planning commission. 
                  (2)  An application for special permit use shall be filed with the planning and zoning director at least 30 days prior to the next regularly scheduled meeting of the city planning commission. Such application shall contain all information requested thereon and any other material or information pertinent to the request which the planning commission may require. 
                  (3)  Public hearings, public hearing procedures, and standards for special use permits. 
                  a.  Required public hearings. No official action shall be taken on any proposed special permit unless one public hearing has been held. The public hearing shall be conducted by the planning commission. 
                  b.  Procedure for calling a public hearing. 
                  1.  Prior to scheduling required public hearings, applicants shall complete all submission requirements provided by the planning and zoning director (e.g., forms, fees, deeds, maps, etc.) 
                  2.  The planning and zoning director shall then notify the applicant of the date, time, and place of the required public hearing. 
                  3.  At least 16, but not more than 44 days prior to scheduled public hearings, the planning and zoning director shall publish in the newspaper of general circulation, notice of the date, time, place, and purpose of the public hearing. 
                  4.  Not less than 15 days prior to the date of a public hearing, the planning and zoning director shall post in a conspicuous location on the property in question a sign which shall contain information regarding the proposed special permit; specifically the date, time, place, and purpose of the public hearing. 
                  5.  The primary goal of conducting public hearings on proposed special permits shall be to solicit pertinent factual information which will be beneficial in helping the planning commission judge the merits of each specific proposed special permit. 
                  (i)  Notice to property owners. The planning and zoning director shall give notice of the date, time, place, and purpose of public hearings to be held by the planning commission on proposed special permits or supplements by mail to the owners of all properties abutting any part of the property proposed to be changed. The failure to notify as provided in this section, shall not invalidate any recommendations or action adopted hereunder. 
                  (ii)  Action of planning commission. The planning commission may recommend approval of the application, as submitted, to city council; or it may require conditions for approval before recommendation of approval is made to city council; or it may recommend denial of the application. These recommendations shall then be certified to the city council. 
                  (iii)  Action of the city council. The city council shall consider the recommendations of the planning commission, and vote on the special permit. If the proposed special permit is not recommended by the planning commission, the favorable vote of a majority of the city council shall be required to approve the special permit. The applicant and others so requesting shall receive notice of the decision of the city council through the planning and zoning director. 
                  (iv)  Denial of special permits. If the decision of the city council is to deny the special permit, then the same property may not again be considered for a special permit until the expiration of at least six months immediately following the defeat of the special permit by the city council. 
                  (v)  Appeals of decision. Decisions of the city council may be appealed to the superior court as described in section 110-165 of this chapter. A written appeal must be submitted to the court within 30 days after the city council decision otherwise, its decision is final. 
                  c.  Procedure for conducting a public hearing. Public hearings on special permits shall be conducted in the same manner as described in section 110-165 for zoning amendments. 
                  d.  Standards for special use permits. A special use permit recommendation for approval may be granted by the planning commission only if the applicant establishes to the satisfaction of the planning commission that: 
                  1.  Neither the proposed use, nor the proposed site upon which the use will be located is of such a character that the use will have significant adverse impact upon the value or quiet possession of surrounding properties greater than would normally occur from generally permitted uses in the zoning district. In reaching a determination on this standard, the planning commission or city council shall consider: 
                  (i)  The size of the proposed use compared with the surrounding uses; 
                  (ii)  The intensity of the proposed use, including amount of noise to be generated, hours of operation, expanse of pavement, and similar measures of intensity of use, compared with surrounding uses; 
                  (iii)  The potential generation of noise, dust, odor, vibration, glare, smoke, litter and other nuisances; 
                  (iv)  Unusual physical characteristics of the site, including size of the lot, shape of the lot, topography, and soils, which may tend to aggravate adverse impacts upon surrounding properties; 
                  (v)  The degree to which landscaping, fencing and other design elements have been incorporated to mitigate adverse impacts on surrounding properties. 
                  2.  City or other facilities serving the proposed use will not be overburdened or hazards created because of inadequate facilities. In reaching a determination on this standard, the commission shall consider: 
                  (i)  The ability of the traffic to safely move into and out of the site at the proposed location; 
                  (ii)  The presence of facilities to assure the safety of pedestrians passing by or through the site; 
                  (iii)  The capacity of the street network to accommodate the proposed use; 
                  (iv)  The capacity of the sewerage and water supply systems to accommodate the proposed use; 
                  (v)  The capacity of the storm drainage system to accommodate the proposed use; 
                  (vi)  The ability of the fire department to provide necessary protection services to the site and development. 
                  3.  The natural characteristics of the site, including topography, drainage, and relationship to ground and surface waters and floodplain, shall not be such that the proposed use when placed on the site will cause undue harm to the environment or to neighboring properties. 
                  e.  Conditions of special exceptions. Upon consideration of the standards listed in subsection (3)d. above, the planning commission and/or the city council may require, such conditions, in addition to those required by other provisions of this chapter, as it finds necessary to insure compliance with those standards and all other applicable requirements of this chapter. Violation of any of those conditions shall be a violation of this chapter. Such conditions may include, but are not limited to, specifications for: Type of landscaping/vegetation, increased setbacks and yards, specified sewage disposal and water supply facilities, hours of operation, operational controls, professional inspection and maintenance, sureties, location of piers, docks, parking and signs, and types of construction. 
                  (4)  All special use permits shall be licensed by the city. All initial applications for a special use permit shall be accompanied with an application fee of $500.00. If approved, the special use permits will be effective from July 1 through June 30 of each calendar year. If the special use permit application is denied, $250.00 of the initial application shall be refunded to the applicant. All existing special use permits shall expire on September 1, 2003, unless renewed pursuant to the provisions of this amended section. Thereafter, all special use permits are required to be renewed each July 1, at a cost of $75.00. 
                  (5)  Electronic game promotions. Performance standards and development criteria. It is the intent of the city that these supplementary regulation standards and criteria be in addition to, rather than in lieu of, any other requirement in this chapter.

                  (8)  Landside buffers: Both performance buffers and standard buffers may be required. 
                  a.  Performance buffers: The planning commission will carefully analyze any buffers between the MHD and surrounding residential neighborhoods with particular regard to the objectives and requirements of this section. The commission may tailor buffers to include greater setbacks, landscaping, fences, walls, and berms, considering the relative heights of the uses on each side of the buffer. The commission may allow for buffering to be located on adjacent property with consent of the affected property owner (landscaping, fence, or wall, etc.). 
                  b.  Standard buffers. Unless otherwise approved, buffers for nonresidential uses within the MHD shall be established and maintained as per Zoning Ordinance No. 110. 
                  c.  Buffers may only be varied from those established in the event such variance is compatible with the objectives of this section and does not disrupt surrounding properties. Any variance shall follow the process outlined in Zoning Ordinance No. 110. 
                  (e)  Waterside portion of MHD: 
                  (1)  Waterside plan: Applicant for any use in the MHD must submit a plan to the planning commission for approval, following the provisions contained in these regulations and/or the Zoning Ordinance No. 110. In the event of discrepancy between this overlay ordinance and any section of the Zoning Ordinance No. 110, this overlay ordinance has priority. 
                  (2)  The use of the waterside of the MHD is strictly controlled by various agencies of the local, state, and federal government and submission of any plan to the planning commission will be required to first have the appropriate governmental agency approval attached to the application. 
                  (3)  For the purpose of this article, this section covers all docks, buoys, bulkheads, boat ramps, marinas, marsh walks and any manmade fixed constructs from the jurisdictional marsh line as determined in the field by DNR staff within one year of the date of determination, and extending through the water to the city limits. For the purpose of this section, these constructs shall be referred to by the term "fixed constructs". 
                  (4)  The area of the waterside portion of the MHD is as defined above, and shall include all public and private property within the city limits of the City of St. Marys. 
                  (5)  For the purpose of this article, this section covers all ships, boats, trawlers, dinghies, barges, and any manmade floating construct that floats on, is anchored through, or floats below, the water of the St. Marys River and its numerous tributaries, named or unnamed. For the purpose of this section, these constructs shall be referred to by the term "floating constructs". 
                  (6)  This section has no jurisdiction over the waters of the St. Marys River that are outside of the city limits or state line except for the two present and two future floating buoys which are owned by the city and permitted through the Florida DEP. As owner of the buoys, the city retains the right to enforce their use as a property owner, rather than a government agency. 
                  (7)  There are two major types of maritime constructs regulated by this section: floating constructs and fixed constructs. 
                  a.  Floating constructs: All floating constructs shall be regulated by the City of St. Marys with staff as designated by the city manager. Floating constructs will either be docked at a fixed or floating dock to the limits of the approved DNR permit for the dock attached to; or at anchor anywhere within the jurisdictional limits of the City of St. Marys; or attached to the city-owned buoys located within, and permitted by, the State of Florida. 
                  1.  All existing or new constructs shall submit to the Planning Department of the City of St. Marys the following data in order to use the waterside portion of the MHD. This data will be placed on a form provided by the city that will be used to issue a permit for use of the MHD. 
                  i.  Name of vessel. 
                  ii.  Length, beam, draft, and length and width of main deck, gross weight, amount of force that the ship will draw at anchor, whether at a dock or on the hook, and other data as appropriate.

                  vii.  Copy of current Coast Guard certificate as appropriate for the size of ship. Valid registration of the floating construct from the home state/country will also be required. 
                  viii.  Information as to most recent pump out of solid wastes, with a notation as to capacity of the on-board holding tank. This data shall be in the form of a pump out log showing where and when any wastes are discharged, either at a legally approved pump out facility, or at sea in a legal manner. This log shall be available to authorized city and state personnel at all times upon request. All pump out facilities shall have a locking Y valve and related certification that the floating construct will not discharge and treated or untreated wastes within the boundary of the MHD. 
                  ix.  Information as to the water holding tank and need for city water. 
                  2.  Based on the channel width, and the anticipated size of the vessels to be encouraged to visit the city, it is expected that only five to seven large floating constructs will be able to be permitted on the hook and in the channel. 
                  These large floating vessels are identified as any ship with two or more masts of 64 feet in deck length from the bow to the stern with operable sails and identified as barque, galley, barquentine, brig, topsail schooner, fore and aft schooner, ketch, junk, frigate, as well as any ship that is square rigged, or combination of both types rigging. If there is confusion or doubt as to the type of rig that this section covers, the city manager or his designated staff member shall have the authority to designate the type of sailing rig. 
                  Smaller floating constructs will be permitted with no minimum number as long as sufficient distance is maintained between vessels to allow for the changing of the tide. 
                  All vessels desiring to anchor within the harbor shall respect the presence of any buoy identifying the presence of a crab trap, and moor at least 100 feet from the visible surface location of the buoy. 
                  3.  Each floating construct shall register with the city upon docking at a city-owned or controlled dock or buoy or other docks. The city reserves the right to assess a fee for docking privileges. 
                  4.  The following floating constructs are exempt from this section: the ferries used to transmit tourists to Cumberland Island; any city authorized water taxi service to/from Fernandina; any trawler owned by Lang's (and/or their successors and assigns), or other company owning a trawler as approved by the city; any vessel owned and operated by the national park service; any floating construct using the Wheeler Street or Meeting Street boat ramps to enter and leave the landside area; and any floating construct under contract with either marinas (presently known as Lang's (east and west), their successors and assigns) and the Gateway docks. 
                  5.  Registration of all floating constructs shall be available at the office of the planning and building department (or other location as determined by the city council), located at 418 Osborne Street, St. Marys, GA. 31558 from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, not including approved holidays. Ships that arrive after these hours shall immediately contact the city the next day the offices are open. 
                  6.  The city will assist and support a ship that meets the criteria of this section that desires to seek an extension from the Coastal Marshlands Protection Act regarding live-aboard vessels. All documentation and related data shall be by the applicant for the extension. 
                  7.  All crabbing and fishing activities are regulated by various departments of the State of Georgia. This section shall not permit any infringement of the permit rights of any crabber or fisherman. 
                  b.  Fixed constructs: Each existing fixed construct shall have a valid DNR water bottom lease. Any future proposed fixed construct shall be in compliance with all lease documents, permits and approvals from the local, State of Georgia, or federal government. 
                  1.  Existing fixed constructs currently in operation and/or permitted shall be exempt from this section. 
                  2.  Each NEW and proposed fixed construct shall apply for and obtain a building permit with the fee calculated as per the currently approved city fee schedule. No city building permit will be issued without a valid and approved DNR permit attached to the application. The resident shall be solely responsible for obtaining any DNR and/or Corp of Engineers permits for any dock or bulkhead fixed construct, including floating docks. The city will provide any necessary plan approval for applicants use in obtaining these DNR and USCOE permits. 
                  3.  For the purpose of this section, any floating dock attached to a fixed dock shall be treated as a fixed construct. 
                  4.  In the event of a natural disaster or emergency, the city reserves the right to permit large vessels of any type to anchor in the MHD at no cost. 
                  5.  All fees shall be waived for any officially sanctioned "Tall Ship" festival as approved by the city as an event.

                  Sec. 110-145. - Special permit uses. 
                  The uses listed under the various land use districts (article II, division 2) as "special permit uses" are so classified because they more intensely dominate the area in which they are located than do other uses which are called permitted uses. Special permit uses are uses which would not normally be appropriate in a district unless strictly controlled as to size, lot coverage, impact on public services, visibility, traffic and other such characteristics. The following procedure is established to integrate the special permit uses with other land uses located in the district. These uses shall be reviewed and authorized or rejected under the following procedure: 
                  (1)  When applying for a building permit, the applicant shall be informed by the planning and zoning director that the proposed use is a special permit use. The matter will then be referred to the planning commission. 
                  (2)  An application for special permit use shall be filed with the planning and zoning director at least 30 days prior to the next regularly scheduled meeting of the city planning commission. Such application shall contain all information requested thereon and any other material or information pertinent to the request which the planning commission may require. 
                  (3)  Public hearings, public hearing procedures, and standards for special use permits. 
                  a.  Required public hearings. No official action shall be taken on any proposed special permit unless one public hearing has been held. The public hearing shall be conducted by the planning commission. 
                  b.  Procedure for calling a public hearing. 
                  1.  Prior to scheduling required public hearings, applicants shall complete all submission requirements provided by the planning and zoning director (e.g., forms, fees, deeds, maps, etc.) 
                  2.  The planning and zoning director shall then notify the applicant of the date, time, and place of the required public hearing. 
                  3.  At least 16, but not more than 44 days prior to scheduled public hearings, the planning and zoning director shall publish in the newspaper of general circulation, notice of the date, time, place, and purpose of the public hearing. 
                  4.  Not less than 15 days prior to the date of a public hearing, the planning and zoning director shall post in a conspicuous location on the property in question a sign which shall contain information regarding the proposed special permit; specifically the date, time, place, and purpose of the public hearing. 
                  5.  The primary goal of conducting public hearings on proposed special permits shall be to solicit pertinent factual information which will be beneficial in helping the planning commission judge the merits of each specific proposed special permit. 
                  (i)  Notice to property owners. The planning and zoning director shall give notice of the date, time, place, and purpose of public hearings to be held by the planning commission on proposed special permits or supplements by mail to the owners of all properties abutting any part of the property proposed to be changed. The failure to notify as provided in this section, shall not invalidate any recommendations or action adopted hereunder. 
                  (ii)  Action of planning commission. The planning commission may recommend approval of the application, as submitted, to city council; or it may require conditions for approval before recommendation of approval is made to city council; or it may recommend denial of the application. These recommendations shall then be certified to the city council. 
                  (iii)  Action of the city council. The city council shall consider the recommendations of the planning commission, and vote on the special permit. If the proposed special permit is not recommended by the planning commission, the favorable vote of a majority of the city council shall be required to approve the special permit. The applicant and others so requesting shall receive notice of the decision of the city council through the planning and zoning director. 
                  (iv)  Denial of special permits. If the decision of the city council is to deny the special permit, then the same property may not again be considered for a special permit until the expiration of at least six months immediately following the defeat of the special permit by the city council. 
                  (v)  Appeals of decision. Decisions of the city council may be appealed to the Superior Court as described in section 110-165 of this chapter. A written appeal must be submitted to the court within 30 days after the city council decision otherwise, its decision is final. 
                  c.  Procedure for conducting a public hearing. Public hearings on special permits shall be conducted in the same manner as described in section 110-165 for zoning amendments. 
                  d.  Standards for special use permits. A special use permit recommendation for approval may be granted by the planning commission only if the applicant establishes to the satisfaction of the planning commission that: 
                  1.  Neither the proposed use, nor the proposed site upon which the use will be located is of such a character that the use will have significant adverse impact upon the value or quiet possession of surrounding properties greater than would normally occur from generally permitted uses in the zoning district. In reaching a determination on this standard, the planning commission or city council shall consider: 
                  (i)  The size of the proposed use compared with the surrounding uses; 
                  (ii)  The intensity of the proposed use, including amount of noise to be generated, hours of operation, expanse of pavement, and similar measures of intensity of use, compared with surrounding uses; 
                  (iii)  The potential generation of noise, dust, odor, vibration, glare, smoke, litter and other nuisances; 
                  (iv)  Unusual physical characteristics of the site, including size of the lot, shape of the lot, topography, and soils, which may tend to aggravate adverse impacts upon surrounding properties; 
                  (v)  The degree to which landscaping, fencing and other design elements have been incorporated to mitigate adverse impacts on surrounding properties. 
                  2.  City or other facilities serving the proposed use will not be overburdened or hazards created because of inadequate facilities. In reaching a determination on this standard, the commission shall consider: 
                  (i)  The ability of the traffic to safely move into and out of the site at the proposed location; 
                  (ii)  The presence of facilities to assure the safety of pedestrians passing by or through the site; 
                  (iii)  The capacity of the street network to accommodate the proposed use; 
                  (iv)  The capacity of the sewerage and water supply systems to accommodate the proposed use; 
                  (v)  The capacity of the storm drainage system to accommodate the proposed use; 
                  (vi)  The ability of the fire department to provide necessary protection services to the site and development. 
                  3.  The natural characteristics of the site, including topography, drainage, and relationship to ground and surface waters and floodplain, shall not be such that the proposed use when placed on the site will cause undue harm to the environment or to neighboring properties. 
                  e.  Conditions of special exceptions. Upon consideration of the standards listed in subsection (3)d. above, the planning commission and/or the city council may require, such conditions, in addition to those required by other provisions of this chapter, as it finds necessary to insure compliance with those standards and all other applicable requirements of this chapter. Violation of any of those conditions shall be a violation of this chapter. Such conditions may include, but are not limited to, specifications for: Type of landscaping/vegetation, increased setbacks and yards, specified sewage disposal and water supply facilities, hours of operation, operational controls, professional inspection and maintenance, sureties, location of piers, docks, parking and signs, and types of construction. 
                  (4)  Where the city council authorizes the issuance of a special permit use for the use of land or building, as listed in article II, "Land Use Districts", that special permit shall be issued only to the applicant/entity requesting the special permit use and only for the specific use presented at the public hearing. No special permit use shall be transferable or assignable, even if the use is unchanged. 
                  (5)  All special use permits shall be licensed by the city. All initial applications for a special use permit shall be accompanied with an application fee of $500.00. If approved, the special use permits will be effective from July 1 through June 30 of each calendar year. If the special use permit application is denied, $250.00 of the initial application shall be refunded to the applicant. All existing special use permits shall expire on September 1, 2003, unless renewed pursuant to the provisions of this amended section. Thereafter, all special use permits are required to be renewed each July 1, at a cost of $75.00. 
                  (6)  Electronic game promotions. Performance standards and development criteria. It is the intent of the City of St. Marys that these supplementary regulation standards and criteria be in addition to, rather than in lieu of, any other requirement in this chapter. The following uses, whether permitted or permissible by exception, must meet the criteria listed under each use as a prerequisite for further consideration under this Zoning Code: 
                  (a)  Any game promotions or sweepstakes utilizing electronic equipment and drawings by chance conducted in connection with the sale of a consumer product or service utilizing electronic equipment. 
                  (b)  Distance limitations. Such establishments shall not operate within 750 feet of the perimeter property line of a church or school, and 3,000 feet of the perimeter property line of a military installation. With respect to the distance between such an establishment and an established church, school, or military installation the distance shall be measured by following a straight line from the nearest point of the building or portion of the building used as part of the proposed location to the nearest point of the grounds (property line) used as part of the church, school facilities, or military installation. The applicant for such an establishment which involves a change in location or a new location shall provide the planning department with a map of the proposed location and vicinity. The map shall show existing zoning and all locations of schools, churches and military installations within a radius of 750 feet for schools and churches and 3,000 feet for military installations of the proposed location and the actual distances thereto from the proposed location measured as required herein. The map shall include a certificate that all distance requirements as required herein as it relates to the proposed location have been met and both the map and certificate shall be prepared and executed by a land surveyor registered in the State of Georgia. 
                  (c)  Where an establishment for game promotions or sweepstakes utilizing electronic equipment and nonconforming drawings by chance conducted in connection with the sale of a consumer product or service utilizing electronic equipment exists lawfully in any zoning district prior to the passage of this provision, such use may be continued on such property as a nonconforming use subject to all restrictions, limitations and requirements set forth in chapter 22, article VII, "Electronic Game Promotions", and all other applicable provisions of the Code of Ordinances for continuance of a nonconforming use.

                  Sec. 110-146. - Variances. 
                  The planning commission may authorize a variance from the requirements of this chapter where it can be shown that owing to special and unusual circumstances related to a specific lot, strict application of the chapter would cause an undue or unnecessary hardship. No variance shall be granted to allow the use of property for a purpose not authorized within the zone in which the proposed use would be located. In granting a variance the planning commission may attach conditions which it finds necessary to protect the best interests of the surrounding property or vicinity and otherwise achieve the purpose of this chapter. 
                  (a)  Conditions governing the granting of a variance. A variance may be granted by the planning commission only in the event that all of the following circumstances exist: 
                  (1)  Exceptional or extraordinary circumstances apply to the property which do not apply generally to other properties in the same vicinity, and result from lot size or shape, topography or other circumstances over which the owners of the property since enactment of this chapter have had no control. 
                  (2)  The variance is necessary for the preservation of a property right of the applicant substantially the same as owners of their property in the same zone or vicinity possess. 
                  (3)  The variance would not materially be detrimental to the purposes of this chapter, or to property in the same zone or vicinity in which the property is located, or otherwise conflict with the objective of any city plan or policy. 
                  (4)  The variance requested is the minimum variance which would alleviate the hardship. 
                  (5)  The lot in question cannot yield a reasonable return unless the variance is granted. 
                  (6)  The need for a variance is not the result of the action of the owner or previous owner. 
                  (b)  Public hearings, public hearing procedures, and procedures for taking action for variances. 
                  (1)  Required public hearings. No official action shall be taken on any proposed variance unless a public hearing has been held by the planning commission. Public hearings on variances shall be conducted in the same manner as described in section 110-165 for zoning amendments. 
                  (2)  Procedure for calling a public hearing. 
                  a.  Prior to scheduling the required public hearings, applicants shall first complete all submission requirements provided by the planning and zoning director (e.g., forms, fees, deeds, maps, etc.) A complete application must be filed 30 days prior to the planning commission meeting where the application will be heard. The application shall be accompanied by a list of names and addresses of all abutting property owners of the property for which the variance is requested, shown by the current City of St. Marys tax maps and indexes thereof. The failure to notify as provided in this section shall not invalidate any recommendations or actions adopted hereunder. 
                  b.  The planning and zoning director shall then notify the applicant of the date, time, and place of the required public hearing. 
                  c.  At least 16 but not more than 44 days prior to scheduled public hearings, the planning and zoning direc-tor shall publish in the newspaper of general circulation, notice of the date, time, place, and purpose of the public hearing. 
                  d.  Not less than 15 days prior to the date of a public hearing, the planning and zoning director shall post in a conspicuous location on the property in question a sign which shall contain information regarding the proposed variance; specifically the date, time, place, and purpose of the public hearing. 
                  e.  No official action shall be taken on a proposed variance by the planning commission until after the required public hearing has been conducted. The commission may conduct more than one hearing if the commission deems necessary. 
                  f.  The primary goal of conducting public hearing on proposed variance shall be to solicit pertinent factual information which will be beneficial in helping the planning commission judge the need of the proposed variance. 
                  1.  Notice to property owners. The planning and zoning director shall give notice of the date, time, place, and purpose of public hearing to be held by the planning commission on proposed variance by mail to the owners of all properties abutting any part of the property proposed to be changed. The failure to notify as provided in this section, shall not invalidate any recommendations adopted hereunder. 
                  2.  Action by planning commission. The planning commission shall render its decision based on the variance criteria in (a) above. The planning and zoning director shall notify the applicant within five days of the decision by the planning commission. 
                  3.  Time limit on permit for variance. Authorization of a variance shall be void after one year unless substantial construction has taken place. However, the planning commission may extend authorization for an additional period not to exceed one year, on request. 
                  4.  Denial of variances. If the decision of the planning commission is to deny the variance, then the same property may not again be considered for a variance until the expiration of at least six months immediately following the defeat of the variance by the planning commission. 
                  5.  Appeals of decision. Decisions of the planning commission may be appealed to the city council as described in section 110-162 of this chapter.

Each day the violation continues constitutes a separate offense and will be treated as such. In the case of any building, structure, or land used, erected, repaired, converted, or maintained in violation of this chapter, the building official or any other appropriate authority, or any city resident who would be damaged by such violation, may institute injunction, mandamus, or other appropriate action to prevent the use of the building, structure, or land.

The applicant and others so requesting shall receive notice of the decision of the city council through the planning and zoning director. 
                  d.  Conditions of zoning amendments. Upon consideration of the standards listed in subsection (d) below, the planning commission may recommend and the city council may require, such conditions, in addition to those required by other provisions of this chapter, as it finds necessary to ensure compliance with those standards and all other applicable requirements of this chapter. Violation of any of those conditions shall be a violation of this chapter. Such conditions may include, but are not limited to, specifications for: type of landscaping/vegetation, increased setbacks and yards, specified sewage disposal and water supply facilities, hours of operation, operational controls, professional inspection and maintenance, sureties, location of piers, docks, parking and signs, and types of construction. 
                  e.  Denial of rezonings. If the decision of the city council is to deny the rezoning of property, then the same property may not again be considered for rezoning until the expiration of at least six months immediately following the defeat of the rezoning by the city council. 
                  f.  Action by city to rezone property to original zoning. When a map amendment (rezoning) has been granted for a parcel of land on request by the owner or his agent, and no building permit has been applied for within 12 months of the date of the rezoning, the planning and zoning director will initiate action to rezone the parcel to its original zoning. The procedures in this article shall be followed, except that no fees shall be paid.

                  (1)  All public hearings on zoning amendments shall be chaired by either the chairman of the planning commission or the mayor of St. Marys or their designees. 
                  (2)  A secretary shall record the proceedings of the public hearing. If requested by any party, verbatim transcripts of the public hearing can be prepared, but, only if requested and purchased in advance by the requesting party. 
                  (3)  The record of the public hearing and all evidence submitted at the public hearing shall be recorded as such and become a permanent part of the particular zoning amendment's file. 
                  (4)  The chairman of the planning commission or his or her designee shall preside at the public hearing and shall identify speakers, maintain order, and conduct the public hearing. 
                  (5)  The process to be followed in conducting these hearings shall be as follows: 
                  a.  The presiding officer shall open the hearing by stating the specific zoning amendment being considered at the public hearing. 
                  b.  When there are a large number of individuals wishing to testify at a hearing, the presiding officer may invoke time limits on individual speakers. In such cases, these time limits shall apply to all speakers. 
                  c.  The presiding officer shall recognize the individual parties wishing to testify on present evidence and allow them to present this information. 
                  d.  Once all parties have concluded their testimony, the presiding officer shall adjourn the public hearing. 
                  (d)  Zoning amendment criteria. The following will be used to determine whether the rezoning is appropriate. 
                  (1)  The zoning request should be a logical extension of a zoning boundary which would improve the pattern of uses in general area. 
                  (2)  The request should not be an illogical extension of a zone boundary which would intrude a damaging salient of a commercial, industrial, or high-density apartment use into a stable neighborhood of well-maintained single-family homes, and would be likely to lead to neighborhood deterioration, the spread of blight, and requests for additional zoning of a similar nature which would expand the problem. 
                  (3)  The request should not result in spot zoning or generally be unrelated to either existing zoning or the pattern of development of the area. 
                  (4)  The request should not create traffic which would traverse established single-family neighborhoods on minor streets, leading to congestion, noise and traffic hazards. 
                  (5)  The request should conform to the general expectations for population growth and distribution. 
                  (6)  The request should not limit options for the acquisition of future planned public facility sites, roads, open-space, etc. 
                  (7)  This request should not result in major changes in existing levels of public service, and/or fiscal stability. 
                  (8)  This request should not achieve short term goals at the expense of long-term, development goals. 
                  (9)  This request should not result in changes to market values and/or tax rates of nearby properties. 
                  (10)  The request should conform to policies and recommendations contained in the St. Marys/Camden County Comprehensive Plan. 
                  A negative finding on one or more of these criteria shall not preclude approval of a rezoning.

The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original franchise agreement. Obvious misspellings and punctuation errors have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes, a uniform system of headings, catchlines, capitalization, citation to state statutes, and expression of numbers in text has been used to conform to the Code of Ordinances. Additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets. 
                  State Law reference— Power to grant franchises or make contracts with public utilities, O.C.G.A. § 36-34-2(7); limitation on action expanding the power of regulation over any business activity regulated by the Public Service Commission, O.C.G.A. § 36-35-6. 

                  Sec. 1. - Grant of franchise. 
                  The right is hereby granted to the Atlanta Gas Light Company, its successors and assigns, to lay, construct, extend, maintain, renew, replace, and repair gas pipes, valves, manholes, service boxes, posts, lamps, structures, appliances, and all appurtenances and appendages under, along, through, and across any streets, avenues, roads, public highway, alleys, lanes, ways, parks, and other public places in the city, and to use and occupy the said streets, avenues, roads, public highways, alleys, lanes, ways, parks, and other public places for the purpose of therein laying, constructing, extending, maintaining, renewing, replacing and repairing mains, pipes, valves, manholes, service boxes, posts, lamps, structures, appliances, and all appurtenances and appendages thereto, used and useful for the manufacture, transmission, distribution, and sale of gas within and through the present or future territorial limits of the city, such right, when exercised as herein provided, to continue until midnight on February 24, 2016. 
                  Sec. 2. - Definitions. 
                  (a)  "Base year" means the fiscal year ending September 30, 1998. 
                  (b)  "Base year franchise fee factor" means the total franchise fees paid during the base year divided by the design day capacity as recorded by the company on the last day of the base year. 
                  (c)  "Design day capacity" means the sum of the individual capacity in dekatherms (Dt) attributable to all firm customers located within the city limits of the city, as of the last day of the previous fiscal year. 
                  (d)  "Firm customers" means all residential and business customers who purchase gas service that ordinarily is not subject to interruption or curtailment. 
                  (e)  "Fiscal year" means the 12 months ending September 30, of each year. 
                  (f)  "Inflation index" means the percentage in the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, or any successor index, for the period from September 30, 1997, to the beginning of the then current fiscal year. The percentage shall be reduced by any productivity factor adjustment for the same time period determined by the Georgia Public Service Commission for the company. 
                  Sec. 3. - Franchise fee. 
                  The total dollar amount of franchise fees paid by the company to the city shall be calculated as follows: 
                  The current fiscal year total franchise fee shall equal the product of the design day capacity and the current franchise fee factor. The current franchise fee factor shall be equal to the product of the base year franchise fee factor and one plus the inflation index expressed as a decimal to three significant digits. 
                  The following formula quantifies the payment: 
                  FF c = FFF by × (1 + (CPI-PFA)) × DDC c 
                  where 
                  FF c = total franchise fees due the city for the current fiscal year. 
                  FFF by = the base year franchise fee factor. 
                  CPI-PFA = the Inflation Index based on the cumulative change in the Consumer Price Index less the productivity factor adjustment determined by the Georgia Public Service Commission. 
                  DDC c = the design day capacity as of the last day of the previous fiscal year. 
                  FFF by = FF by / DDC by 
                  where 
                  FF by = the total franchise fees paid in the base year 
                  and 
                  DDC by = the design day capacity of the base year. 
                  Sec. 4. - Responsibility for payment of franchise fee. 
                  The company as the holder of the franchise privilege hereunder is responsible for the payment of all franchise fees payable hereunder, and shall file such reports and returns as required by the franchise ordinance as modified by this amendment. In addition, the company shall report annually the names of all gas marketers for which company is transporting natural gas on the distribution system within the city. 
                  The franchise fee payments required hereunder shall be in lieu of any franchise fee license fee, occupation tax, or other payment for use of the rights of way by the company for the provision of gas service, but shall not prohibit imposition of a license fee or an occupation tax on gas marketers. 
                  Sec. 5. - Quarterly payments. 
                  Effective for the fiscal year 1999, and for each fiscal year thereafter during the term of the franchise ordinance, the company shall remit to the city quarterly franchise fee installments. The installments shall equal to one-fourth of the total annual franchise fee calculated in accordance with this ordinance. 
                  The quarterly payment is due and payable on or before the 30th day following the last day of each calendar quarter. 
                  Sec. 6. - Annual return. 
                  The company shall file a return with its first quarterly installment in each fiscal year showing the details of the calculation of the annual franchise fee. 
                  Sec. 7. - Delay of inflation adjustment. 
                  Notwithstanding any other provision in this ordinance, any inflation adjustments shall be made to the franchise fee only when the company changes its rates. 
                  Sec. 8. - Scope of ordinance. 
                  All rights herein granted and authorized shall be subject to and governed only by this ordinance; provided, however, that the city expressly reserves unto itself all of its police power to adopt general ordinances necessary to protect the safety and welfare of the general public in relation to the rights hereby granted not inconsistent with the provisions of this ordinance. 
                  Sec. 9. - Excavations; restoration, interference with traffic. 
                  Atlanta Gas Light Company, grantee upon making an opening upon any of the streets, avenues, roads, public highways, alleys, lanes, ways, parks, and other public places in the city, for the purpose of laying, repairing, or maintaining has mains, shall use due care and caution to prevent injury to persons, and shall replace and restore all public ways to their former condition as nearly as practicable, and within a reasonable time, and shall not unnecessarily obstruct or impede traffic upon the streets, avenues, roads, public highways, alleys, lanes, ways, parks, and other places of said city.

                  Editor's note— Printed herein is an ordinance adopted July 11, 2005, which amends the Georgia Power Company franchise, as adopted on December 4, 1975. Obvious misspellings and punctuation errors have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes, a uniform system of headings, catchlines, capitalization, citation to state statutes, and expression of numbers in text has been used to conform to the Code of Ordinances. Additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets. 

                  Sec. I. - [Additional terms and conditions.] 
                  Be it further ordained that in addition to the terms and conditions set forth in the 1975 ordinance, the company's occupancy and use of the streets, alleys, and public places of the city as authorized in the 1975 ordinance are subject to the following terms and conditions: 
                  1.  For purposes of paragraph 2 of this section I, the term "distribution facilities" means poles, lines, wires, cables, conductors, insulators, transformers, appliances, equipment, connections, and other apparatus installed by or on behalf of the company (whether before or after the adoption of this ordinance amending franchise) in the streets, alleys, or public places of the city for the purpose of distributing electricity within the present and future limits of the city. Distribution facilities do not include any of the following: (i) electric transmission lines with a design operating voltage of 46 kilovolts or greater (hereafter referred to as "transmission lines"); (ii) poles, towers, frames, or other supporting structures for transmission lines (hereafter referred to as "transmission structures:); (iii) transmission lines and related wires, cables, conductors, insulators, or other apparatus attached to transmission structures; (iv) lines, wires, cables, or conductors installed in concrete-encased ductwork; or (v) network underground facilities. 
                  2.  In the event that the city or any other entity acting on behalf of the city requests or demands that the company relocate any distribution facilities from their then-current locations within the streets, alleys, and public places of the city in connection with a public project or improvement, then the company shall relocate, at its expense, the distribution facilities affected by such project or improvement. The company's obligations under this paragraph 2 shall apply without regard to whether the company has acquired, or claims to have acquired, an easement or other property right with respect to such distribution facilities and shall not affect the amounts paid or to be paid to the city under the provisions of the 1975 ordinance. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph 2, the company shall not be obligated to relocate, at its expense, any of the following: (i) distribution facilities that are located on private property at the time relocation is requested or demanded; (ii) distribution facilities that are relocated in connection with sidewalk improvements (unless such sidewalk improvements are related to or associated with road widenings, the creation of new turn lanes, or the addition of acceleration/deceleration lanes); (iii) streetscape projects or other projects undertaken primarily for aesthetic purposes; or (iv) distribution facilities that are converted from an overhead configuration or installation to an underground configuration or installation. 
                  3.  The city and the company recognize that both parties benefit from economic development within the city. Accordingly, when it is necessary to relocate any of the company's facilities (whether distribution facilities, transmission structures, or other facilities) within the city, the city and the company shall work cooperatively to minimize costs, delays, and inconvenience to both parties while ensuring compliance with applicable laws and regulations. In addition, the city and the company shall communicate in a timely fashion to coordinate projects included in the city's five-year capital improvement plan, the city's short-term work program, or the city's annual budget in an effort to minimize relocation of the company's facilities. Such communication may include, but is not limited to, (i) both parties' participation in the Georgia Utilities Coordinating Council, Inc. (or any successor organization) or a local utilities coordinating council (or any successor organization) and (ii) both parties' use of the National Joint Utility Notification System (or any successor to such system mutually acceptable to both parties). 
                  4.  With regard to each streetscape project undertaken by or on behalf of the city, the city shall pay the company in advance for the company's estimated cost to relocate any of the company's facilities (whether distribution facilities, transmission lines, transmission structures, or other facilities) in connection with such project. For each streetscape project, the company shall estimate in good faith the amount of incremental base revenue, if any, that the company will realize as a result of new customer load or expansion of existing customer load attributable to such project; and such estimate shall be based on tariffs in effect at the time that construction of such project begins and shall not include fuel recover charges, non-electric service billings, or taxes. If such estimate indicates that the company will realize incremental base revenue, the company shall do one of the following, whichever results in greater cost savings to the city: (i) reduce the city's advance payment to the company for relocation costs by ten percent; or (ii) where the city has developed a bona fide marketing plan within 12 months after construction of such project begins, either refund the amount of the company's incremental base revenue during such 12-month period to the city or credit such amount against any future payment due from the city to the company. The city and the company acknowledge and agree that the amount of any refund or credit calculated pursuant to clause (ii) of the foregoing sentence of this paragraph 4 shall not exceed the amount of the city's advance payment to the company for relocation costs associated with such project. 
                  (Ord. of 7-11-05, § I) 
                  Sec. II. - [Right to select electric supplier.] 
                  Be it further ordained that nothing contained in this ordinance amending franchise shall limit or restrict the right of customers within the corporate limits of the city to select an electric supplier as may hereafter be provided by law. 
                  (Ord. of 7-11-05, § II) 
                  Sec. III. - [Filing of amendment.] 
                  Be it further ordained that the company shall, within 90 days from the approval of this ordinance amending franchise, file the company's written acceptance of the same with the clerk of the city, so as to form an amendment to the franchise between the company and the city. 
                  (Ord. of 7-11-05, § III) 
                  Sec. IV. - [Conflicting laws and ordinances repealed.] 
                  Be it further ordained that upon such acceptance all laws and ordinances, and all agreements between the company and the city with respect to the company's occupancy and use of the city's streets, alleys, and public places, in actual conflict herewith be and the same shall thereupon stand repealed and terminated, respectively.
