CODE OF ORDINANCES CITY OF SOCIAL CIRCLE, GEORGIA 
____________ 
Published in 2018 by Order of the City Council

PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a codification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Social Circle, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 2014 Code, as supplemented through 2016, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 2014 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Index 
The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
The publisher is most grateful to Susan M. Roper, City Clerk, for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that her efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Sec. 3-137. - Bids and proposals. 
The two primary procurement methods for the city shall be competitive sealed bidding and competitive sealed proposals. All procurements shall be made via one of these two methods unless the procurement falls under the sole source procurement, or emergency procurement sections above, which serve as exceptions to these two primary methods. The terms and conditions of the purchasing section of the financial policies of the current budget are incorporated into this article as Schedule 1 attached to Ord. No. 2017-21 and incorporated herein by reference. 
(1)  Competitive sealed bidding. An invitation for bids shall be issued and shall include specifications, and all contractual terms and conditions applicable to the procurement. Adequate public notice of the invitation for bids shall be given a reasonable time, not less than 15 calendar days prior to the date set forth therein for the opening of bids. The public notice shall state the place, date, and time of bid opening. Bids shall be opened publicly in the presence of one or more witnesses at the time and place designated in the invitation for bids. The amount of each bid and such other relevant information as the city manager deems appropriate shall be recorded. The record and each bid shall be open to public inspection. 
Bids shall be unconditionally accepted without alteration or correction, except as authorized in this article. Bids shall be evaluated based on the requirements set forth in the invitation for bids—no other criteria may be used in bid evaluation. Such requirements may include criteria to determine acceptability such as inspection, testing, quality, workmanship, delivery, and suitability for a particular purpose. 
Correction or withdrawal of inadvertently erroneous bids before or after bid opening, or cancellation of awards or contracts based on such bid mistakes, may be permitted where appropriate. Mistakes discovered before bid opening may be modified or withdrawn by written notice received in the office designated in the invitation for bids prior to the time set for bid opening. After bid opening, no changes in bids shall be permitted unless the bidder can show by clear and convincing evidence that a mistake of a nonjudgmental character was made, the nature of the mistake, and the bid price actually intended. In lieu of bid correction, a low bidder alleging a material mistake of fact may be permitted to withdraw its bid if: (1) the mistake is clearly evident on the face of the bid document but the intended correct bid is not similarly evident, or (2) the bidder submits evidence which clearly and convincingly demonstrates that a mistake was made. All decisions to permit correction or withdrawal of bids shall be supported by written determination by a city official. 
The contract shall be awarded with reasonable promptness by appropriate written notice to the lowest responsible and responsive bidder whose bid meets the requirements and criteria set forth in the invitation for bids. In the event the low responsive and responsible bid for a given project exceeds available funds as certified by the appropriate fiscal officer, the city manager is authorized, when time or economic considerations preclude re-solicitation of work of a reduced scope, to negotiate an adjustment of the bid price with the low responsive and responsible bidder, in order to bring the bid within the amount of available funds. 
(2)  Competitive sealed proposals. When the city manager, or other relevant department head, determines that the use of competitive sealed bidding is either not practicable or not advantageous to the city, a contract may be entered into by use of the competitive sealed proposals method. 
As provided in a request for proposals, discussions may be conducted with responsible offerors who submit proposals determined to be reasonably susceptible of being selected for award for the purpose of clarification to assure full understanding of, and conformance to, the solicitation requirements. 
Award shall be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal is determined in writing to be the most advantageous to the city, taking into consideration price and the evaluation factors set forth in the request for proposals. No factors other than those set forth in the request for proposals may be used in the evaluation.

Any project or contract governed by these statutes shall follow and satisfy the requirements therein, notwithstanding any conflicting provision of this article.

The foregoing notwithstanding, the definition of company shall not include any entity with whom the city has a written franchise agreement. 
The use by any company of the streets, alleys, public places and other property of the city for the operation of any of its electric distribution systems, and the grant of requisite street franchise rights, is expressly conditioned upon payment by such company of franchise fees pursuant to this section, and continued use and occupancy of such city property for said purpose without payment of such franchise fees shall be unlawful, and the city shall be entitled to enforce compliance with this section by appropriate proceeding at law or in equity. 
Provided further, that the rights, permission and consents herein contained are made for the following considerations and upon the following terms and conditions, to wit: 
(1)  Each company shall pay to the city on or before the 20th day of each month, a sum of money equal to five percent of the gross sales of electric energy to all of such company's customers served within the corporate limits of the City during the preceding month. The five percent rate herein specified shall be reviewed at the first council meeting in January of each year and may be changed by majority vote of the council to such other levels as are allowed or mandated by law. Such a rate change shall take effect on February 1st of the year in which such rate change is approved. The city should provide the company with written notice of any such rate change. 
(2)  The percentage of gross revenues prescribed to be collected shall be in lieu of all other license and business or occupation taxes, but shall not at any time be considered to interfere with, or in any way prevent the collection of, ad valorem taxes upon the property of the company in the same manner as all other property, real and personal, in the city is taxed. 
(3)  In the event the city shall grant to any other electric utility the right to use and occupy its streets for like purposes, such use and occupancy shall be upon the same terms and conditions as those herein contained, including the payment provisions.

In the event of forfeiture for failure to comply with such requirements, the forfeiting company shall nevertheless remain liable for all sums accrued until such time as the company removes all of its property from the city following such forfeiture. 
(7)  The city manager shall be responsible for the administration and enforcement of this section, and shall have the power to prepare and provide for the collection of the fees herein required.

Sec. 7-28. - Minimum requirements for erosion and sedimentation control. 
(a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not excluded by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion and sedimentation control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion and sedimentation control plans. Soil erosion and sedimentation control practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of O.C.G.A. §§ 12-7-1 et seq. and of subsections (b) and (c). The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion and sedimentation pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity. 
(b)  Minimum requirements/BMP'S. 
(1)  Best management practices as set forth in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 and in this article shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with subsection (2) of this section or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection, the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed to control soil erosion and sedimentation for all rainfall events up to and including a 25-year, 24-hour rainfall event and in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
(2)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by the issuing authority or by the division or of any general permit for construction activities issued by the Division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with construction of single-family homes not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
(3)  Failure to properly design, install or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by the issuing authority or by the division or of any general permit for construction activities issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs. 
(4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land-disturbing activities occur. 
(c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances or resolutions adopted pursuant to this article governing land-disturbing activities shall require, at a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit, and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
(1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted so as to minimize erosion; 
(2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
(3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practical erosion potential; 
(4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
(5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
(6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
(7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
(8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control measures shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
(9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. §§ 12-7-1, et seq.; 
(10)  Adequate provisions must be made to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping surface of fills; 
(11)  Cuts and fills may not adversely affect adjoining property; 
(12)  Fills may not encroach on natural watercourses or constructed channels so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
(13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts, except when such methods are not feasible and provided, in any such case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
(14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion and sedimentation control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection (b)(2) of this Code; 
(15)  Except as provided in subsection (16), there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, or where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented; provided, however, that buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to O.C.G.A. art. 5, pt. 6, tit. 12, ch. 5, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. A stream buffer of 25 feet in width shall be maintained in addition to the 25-foot state waters buffer. The following requirements apply to any such buffer: 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality or aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
1.  Stream crossings for water lines, or 
2.  Stream crossings for sewer lines. 
(16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" per O.C.G.A. tit. 12, ch. 5, art. 2, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirements for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements apply to such buffer: 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented; 
1.  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
2.  Stream crossings for sewer lines. 
(17)  Land-disturbing activities shall not be conducted within 100 horizontal feet, as measured from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, of the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to O.C.G.A. tit. 12, ch. 5, art. 2, the "Georgia Water Quality Act," unless a variance for such activity is granted by the director, except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. 
(d)  Nothing contained in this section shall prevent the issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances or resolutions which contain requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections (b) and (c). 
(e)  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
(Former § 7-003(4.)) 
Sec. 7-29. - Application/permit process. 
(a)  General.

Secs. 7-35—7-50. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE III. - STORMWATER MANAGEMENT 

Sec. 7-51. - Purpose. 
The purpose of this section is to protect, maintain, and enhance the public health, safety, and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse impacts from stormwater discharges within the city. Proper management of surface water runoff will reduce channel erosion, stream sedimentation, local flash flooding, assist in the attainment and maintenance of water quality standards, and maintain as practically as possible the pre-development surface water runoff characteristics of the area. 
(Former § 7-003B(1.)) 
Sec. 7-52. - Policy. 
It is hereby declared to be public policy to: 
(1)  Recognize the necessity of joint action where feasible by the city and the development industry in resolution of existing drainage problems and prevention of their worsening or recurrence; 
(2)  Work in a cooperative relationship with the development industry to accomplish the above-stated objective by encouraging through this chapter and other public actions the development of fewer but larger major detention facilities and incremental resolution of existing drainage problems on a priority basis in concert with private development activities; 
(3)  Maintain, where feasible, the natural environment of city streams through reduction of flow quantities resulting from new development, and where feasible, restore the flood plain to its natural functional purpose to resolve existing flooding problems, but recognize the necessity of using urban streams for stormwater runoff in those situations where maintenance of the natural stream environment would result in continuation or worsening of flooding conditions; 
(4)  Require the development industry to maintain the function of the storm drainage system during the development process and property owners thereafter; 
(5)  Encourage the construction of joint detention ponds serving several residential properties. The city encourages the location of these detention facilities off the site of the property under development and may participate where it is in the general public's best interest in the construction of major detention facilities which would serve not only the needs of the property under development, but would assist in resolving existing flooding problems; 
(6)  Encourage innovative design solutions to the effective detention of runoff. 
(Former § 7-003B(2.)) 
Sec. 7-53. - Applicability. 
(a)  All persons proposing development and/or construction within the city shall submit a stormwater management plan and hydrology study to the department for review and approval, except as provided in section 7-54 of this article. 
(b)  A combination of storage and controlled release of stormwater runoff shall be required for all development and construction that will increase the peak rate of runoff from the site by more than one cubic foot per second for a ten-year frequency storm. The requirement of this paragraph may be waived by the director if it can be shown by detailed engineering including descriptions, drawings, calculations and any other pertinent information necessary and acceptable to prove to the director that one of the following conditions exists: 
(1)  Installation of stormwater management facilities would reduce downstream flood peaks by less than one percent; or 
(2)  The applicant demonstrates how the downstream drainage system will have enough capacity to receive any increase in runoff for the design storms and protect downstream development without the addition or improvement of stormwater management facilities; or 
(3)  The applicant demonstrates the proposed site design will meet the standards of this chapter without such facilities. 
However, the provisions of this subsection (b) shall not be waived if the director determines that such waiver would increase known flooding problems, or exceed the capacity of the downstream drainage system. 
(Former § 7-003B(3.)) 
Sec. 7-54. - Exemption from requirements. 
(a)  The following development activities are exempt from the requirements of providing a combination of storage and controlled release of stormwater runoff: 
(1)  Agricultural and forestry land management activities. 
(2)  Additions or modifications to existing detached single-family dwellings. 
(3)  Construction of a detached single-family dwelling that is not part of a larger development. 
(4)  Non-residential developments with less than 5,000 square feet of land disturbance activity. 
(5)  Developments of property where the runoff resulting from the proposed development is discharged directly into a Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) identified 100-year flood zone, provided that approved sediment basins are constructed at each significant discharge point to prevent the discharge of sediment from the site, and provided that sufficient energy dissipation devices or structures are installed to limit post development stormwater velocities to less than or equal to pre-development flow velocities at any point on the perimeter of the project. 
(6)  Residential developments consisting of single-family dwellings, each on a lot of five acres or more. 
(b)  When the developer requests and the department agrees that development and construction of nonresidential projects are too small, or that engineering and economic factors make combined detention of other drainage facilities more practical, the department may authorize the joint construction of these facilities to serve two or more properties by two or more developers. Where joint detention facilities serving two or more properties are approved for construction, no use of land or occupancy of building within the properties served by these facilities shall be permitted until completion of the detention facility, and the owners of the joint detention facility have submitted a written agreement that is satisfactory to the department and assigns to one of the parties the responsibility of maintaining that facility. 
(Former § 7-003B(4.))

(Former § 7-003B(6.)) 
Sec. 7-57. - Location criteria for detention facilities. 
(a)  Detention facilities shall be considered to consist of the area within the maximum design ponding limits, the dam (if one) including all embankment slopes and wall footings (if applicable), primary and emergency outlet works, any drainage and access easements, and any energy dissipation devices. 
(b)  Detention facilities shall be designed and located to promote interception of runoff from the proposed land use. "By-pass" areas (areas of non-regulated runoff) shall be permitted only if the combined peak discharge rate from the site meets the requirements of sections 7-55 and 7-56 of this part. 
(c)  Detention facilities shall be located in conformance with the Georgia Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975 (see O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6, 16) and the flood damage prevention regulations of the city. 
(d)  Detention facilities shall be located in accordance with the restrictions created by Title 44, Chapter 1, Subchapter B, Parts 59 and 60 of the Code of Federal Regulations, as amended. 
(e)  Detention facilities shall be located in conformance with the provisions of the Clean Water Act of 1974 as amended regulating land disturbing activities within designated wetland areas. (See Title 404 of the Federal Regulations.) 
(f)  Detention facilities may be constructed within a transitional buffer or recreation areas, upon approval by the director of planning and development on an individual basis dependent on site-specific conditions. Title to the recreation area is to be held by a property owners association, homeowners association or private entity and the design will not interfere with the intended use of the area. Detention facilities constructed on individual lots will be owned and maintained by the property owner. 
(g)  The 100-year ponding elevation created by the detention facility shall be considered a flood hazard and as such, shall require the same provisions as the base flood as defined by the flood damage prevention regulations of the city. 
(h)  The drainage system from a proposed development must discharge into an outfall with adequate capacity to accommodate the runoff from the development. If downstream easements are needed to extend the drainage system to an adequate outfall, the developer shall seek these easements. In the event such easements cannot be obtained by the developer, the county may, at its option, agree to assist the developer in obtaining needed drainage easements using its powers, including condemnation. 
(i)  Detention facilities may be incorporated into lake or pond designs. All such facilities shall be designed and constructed in conformity with applicable state and federal regulations. Design engineers are expected to be knowledgeable of the criteria contained within the Georgia Safe Dams Act, Georgia Department of Natural Resources "Rules for Dam Safety" publication, and the U.S.D.A. Soil Conservation Service's Technical Release No. 60, "Earth Dams and Reservoirs." In lieu of more restrictive design standards, the principles and practices for dam construction as detailed in Design of Small Dams, United States Department of the Interior Bureau of Reclamation, Third Edition, 1987, shall be used. 
(j)  Parking lot detention areas shall be located so as to restrict ponding to areas other than parking spaces near buildings, and to not encroach upon entrance drives. The maximum depth of detention ponding in a parking lot, except at a flow control structure, shall be six inches for a ten-year storm, and nine inches for a 100-year storm. The maximum depth of ponding at a flow control structure shall be 12 inches for a 100-year storm. In truck parking areas, the maximum depth of ponding shall be 12 inches for the ten-year storm. Detention in ponding areas are to be drained within 30 minutes after the peak flow occurs. 
(k)  The 100-year ponding limits of a detention facility shall not encroach upon a public right-of-way. Roadway embankments will not be allowed as a dam for a detention facility. 
(l)  Detention facilities may not be located within utility easements, or encroach upon utility easements or right-of-way, unless the owner provides the department with written permission from both the property and utility owners. 
(Former § 7-003B(7.)) 
Sec. 7-58. - Access and fencing requirements. 
(a)  Access. 
(1)  A 20-foot access easement shall be provided to all storm water management and detention facilities from a public right-of-way. Within the easement shall be constructed an access road of at least 12 feet in width. The road shall have a 12-inch base compacted to 95 percent of the Standard Proctor soil test and be grassed. 
(2)  All storm water management and detention facilities shall be provided with a minimum ten-foot drainage and access easement encompassing entire facility including the 100-year ponding limits and the entire dam. The area surrounding the facility shall be for the purpose of maintaining the facility. 
(3)  Storm water detention facilities shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the city and shall be in place and inspected prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy or acceptance of a final plat. 
(b)  Fencing. 
(1)  Except as provided in subsection (b)(2) below a four-foot chain link fence will be required for every stormwater detention facility. When a four-foot chain link fence is required, the fence shall include double eight-foot wide gates (16 feet total opening) to permit entrance of equipment necessary to allow periodic maintenance activities. 
(2)  A four-foot chain link fence will not be required when the stormwater detention facility meets one of the following criteria: 
a.  When, regardless of pond depth, a minimum of 70 percent of the side slopes is not steeper than a slope of four horizontal to one vertical. 
b.  When the maximum depth of the pond is less than three feet in the 100-year frequency event. 
c.  When the planned facility is a retention facility and the maximum depth change from the normal water surface elevation to the 100-year flood frequency event is less than or equal to four feet. 
d.  When a culvert is downsized to provide stormwater detention through a natural area where the existing topography has not been altered. 
e.  When the site in which the pond is to be constructed is zoned industrial and is more than 500 feet from properties zoned residential or publicly owned property (excluding right-of-way). 
(Former § 7-003B(8.)) 
Sec. 7-59. - Maintenance of stormwater management facilities. 
(a)  The maintenance of any stormwater management facility shall be the responsibility of the mandatory homeowners association of residential subdivision developments or property owner of commercial development. Piped systems and other drainage facilities, whether in an easement or not, outside the county right-of-way, are the responsibility of the mandatory homeowners association in residential subdivision developments or the property owner of commercial property. In residential or commercial developments, stormwater management facility maintenance is to be vested in the mandatory homeowners or property owners association with responsibility clearly vested in the organization through established covenants previously approved by the director. The city has the right, but not the responsibility to access any stormwater management facility for maintenance purposes. 
(b)  Regional stormwater retention facilities, which are deemed by the city to be an essential and integral part of the city stormwater management plan, may be maintained by the city. In order to facilitate the maintenance of said stormwater retention facilities, a drainage easement shall be provided which will encompass the 100-year flood elevation contour plus 20 feet.

Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. (Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (Note: Accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance requirements.) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, or a gas or liquid storage tank. 
Subdivision the division of a single lot into two or more lots for the purpose of sale or development. 
Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the "start of construction" of the improvement. NOTE: The market value of the structure should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include (1) those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project, or (2) any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure". 
Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
Variance is a grant of relief from requirements of this article, which permits construction otherwise prohibited by this article. 
Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this ordinance is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

b.  Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation, or 
2.  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement (see subsection 7-156(6) above). 
d.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
1.  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days. 
2.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions), or 
3.  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "New Construction", including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsections (3)a.—c., above. 
(4)  Floodway. Located in areas of special flood hazard established in section 7-112, are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted, however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
b.  Only if subsection (4)a. above is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this division.

DIVISION 5. - VARIANCE PROCEDURES AND APPEALS 

Sec. 7-181. - Variance procedures and appeals. 
(a)  The Social Circle Planning Commission as established by the city shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this article. 
(b)  The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the city manager in the enforcement or administration of this article. 
(c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the city planning commission may appeal such decision to the Superior Court of Walton County, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1. 
(d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
(f)  Variances shall not be issued in any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during base flood discharge would result. 
(g)  In reviewing such requests, the planning commission shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article. 
(h)  Conditions for variances. 
(1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
c.  A determination that granting a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(2)  The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of a historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
(3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(4)  The city manager shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
(i)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the city planning commission may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

The applicant, if desired, may resubmit the application for the next regular meeting. 
Denial. When considering an application for a certificate of appropriateness, the commission shall deny the application if it finds that the proposed material change in appearance is not in compliance with the criteria and will have a substantial adverse effect on the historic, aesthetic or architectural significance or value of the designated historic property or designated historic district. The commission may suggest alternative courses of action it thinks proper if it disapproves of the application submitted. The applicant, if he so desires, may make modifications to the plans and may resubmit the application at any time after doing so. 
Approval. The commission shall approve the application and issue a certificate of appropriateness if it finds the proposed material change(s) in the appearance would not have a substantial adverse effect on the aesthetic, historic, or architectural significance and value of the historic property or the historic district. In making this determination, the commission shall consider, in addition to any other pertinent factors, and the historical and architectural value and significance of the property, the following factors for each of the following acts: 
Reconstruction, alteration, new construction or renovation: The commission shall issue certificates of appropriateness for the above proposed actions if those actions conform in design, scale, building materials, setback and site features with the exterior architectural style and pertinent features of other structures in the immediate neighborhood, and with the secretary of interior's standards for rehabilitation and guidelines for rehabilitating historic buildings. 
Relocation: A decision by the commission approving or denying a certificate of appropriateness for the relocation of a building, structure, or object shall be guided by: 
(1)  The historic character and aesthetic interest the building, structure or object contributes to its present setting. 
(2)  Whether there are definite plans for the area to be vacated and the effect of those plans on the character of the surrounding area. 
(3)  Whether the building, structure or object can be moved without significant damage to its structural integrity. 
(4)  Whether the proposed relocation area is compatible with the historical and architectural character of the building, structure, site or object. 
Demolition. The commission shall not approve applications for a COA for demolition without first reviewing post-demolition plans. The commission shall approve or deny applications for a COA for demolition consistent with the criteria below. Before an approved COA for demolition becomes effective, notice of said approved COA for demolition shall be given as follows: historic, two months and non-historic, two months. Notice shall be posted on the premises of the building or structure approved for demolition in a location clearly visible from the street. The purpose of this section is to further the purposes of this chapter by preserving historic buildings, structures and objects which are important to the education, culture, traditions and the economic values of the city and to give the city's interested persons, historical societies or organizations the opportunity to acquire or to arrange for the preservation of such buildings, structures and objects. After such two-month delay period, the approved certificate of appropriateness for demolition shall become effective, in which event demolition may commence without further delay. A decision by the commission approving or denying a certificate of appropriateness for the demolition of buildings, structures, sites, trees judged to be 50 years old or older, or objects, shall be guided by: 
(1)  The historic, scenic or architectural significance of the building, structure, site, tree or object. 
(2)  The importance of the building, structure, site, tree, or object to the character of a district. 
(3)  The difficulty or the impossibility of reproducing such a building, structure, site, tree, or object because of its design, texture, material, detail, or unique location. 
(4)  Whether the building, structure, site, tree, or object is one of the last remaining examples in the neighborhood or the city. 
(5)  Whether there are definite plans for use of the property if the proposed demolition is carried out, and the effect of those plans on the character of the surrounding area. 
(6)  Whether reasonable measures can be taken to save the building, structure, site, tree, or object from collapse. 
(7)  Whether the building, structure, site, tree, or object is capable of earning reasonable economic return on its value. 
(h)  Undue hardship. When, by reason of unusual circumstances, the strict application of any provision of this chapter would result in the exceptional practical difficulty or undue economic hardship upon any owner of a specific property, the commission, in reviewing applications, shall have the power to reasonably vary or modify strict provisions, so as to relieve such difficulty or hardship; provided, however, that such variances, modifications or interpretations shall remain in harmony with the general purpose and intent of said provisions, so that the architectural and historical integrity and character of the property shall be conserved and substantial justice done. In granting variances, the commission may impose such reasonable and additional stipulations and conditions as will, in its judgment, best fulfill the purpose of this chapter. An undue hardship shall not be a situation of the person's own making. 
(i)  Deadline for approval or rejection of application for certificate of appropriateness. The commission shall approve or reject an application for a certificate of appropriateness within 45 days after the proper filing thereof by the owner or occupant of a historic property, or of a building structure, site, or object located within a historic district. Evidence of approval shall be by a certificate of appropriateness issued by the commission. Notice of the issuance or denial of a certificate of appropriateness shall be sent by united states mail to the applicant and all other persons who have requested such notice in writing filed with the commission. Failure of the commission to act within said 45 days shall constitute approval, and no other evidence of approval shall be needed. 
(j)  Necessary action by commission upon rejection of application for certificate of appropriateness. In the event the commission rejects an application, it shall state its reasons for doing so, and shall transmit a record of such actions and reasons, in writing, to the applicant. The commission may suggest alternative courses of action it thinks proper if it disapproves of the application submitted. The applicant, if he or she so desires, may make modifications to the plans and may resubmit the application at any time after doing so. In cases where the application covers a material change in the appearance of a structure which would require the issuance of a building permit, the rejection of the application for a certificate of appropriateness by the commission shall be binding upon the building inspector or other administrative officer charged with issuing building permits and, in such a case, no building permit shall be issued. 
(k)  Requirement of conformance with certificate of appropriateness. All work performed pursuant to an issued certificate of appropriateness shall conform to the requirements of such certificate. In the event work is performed not in accordance with such certificate, the commission shall issue a cease and desist order and all work shall cease. The commission and the council shall be authorized to institute any appropriate action or proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent any material change in appearance of a designated historic property or historic district, except those changes made in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, or to prevent any illegal act or conduct with respect to such historic property or historic district. 
(l)  Certificate of appropriateness void if construction not commenced. A certificate of appropriateness shall become void unless construction is commenced within six months of date of issuance. Certificate of appropriateness shall be issued for a period of 12 months and are renewable. 
(m)  Recording an application for certificate of appropriateness. The commission shall keep a public record of all applications for certificates of appropriateness, and all the commission's proceedings in connection with said application. 
(n)  Acquisition of property. The commission may, where such action is authorized by the council and is reasonably necessary or appropriate for the preservation of a unique historic property, enter into negotiations with the owner for the acquisition by gift, purchase, exchange, or otherwise, to the property or any interest therein. 
(o)  Appeals. Any person adversely affected by any determination made by the commission relative to the issuance or denial of a certificate of appropriateness may appeal such determination to the council. Any such appeal must be filed with the council within 30 days after the issuance of the determination pursuant to this section or, in the case of a failure of the commission to act, within 30 days of the expiration of the 45-day period allowed for the commission action pursuant to this section. The council may approve, modify, or reject the determination made by the commission, if the governing body finds that the commission abused its discretion in reaching its decision. Appeals from decisions of the council may be taken to the superior court of Walton County in the manner provided by law for appeals from conviction for City Code violations. 
(Former § 7-010(5.)) 
Sec. 7-236. - Maintenance of historic properties and building and zoning code provisions. 
(a)  Ordinary maintenance and repair. Ordinary maintenance or repair of any exterior architectural feature in or on an historic property, to correct deterioration, decay or damage, or to sustain the existing form, and that does not involve a change in the design, material, texture or the exterior appearance thereof, does not require a certificate of appropriateness. 
(b)  Standards of minimum maintenance and repair. The commission and the city shall further insure that all designated historic properties and places, sites, buildings, structures and works of art within designated historic districts are kept free from the following conditions which threaten the deterioration or loss of such properties. Owners shall maintain their structures as to not endanger the property: 
(1)  Foundations. Shall be free of holes, wide cracks and buckling. 
(2)  Structural members. Vertical supports shall not split, lean, list or buckle. Structural members of ceilings and roofs, or other horizontal structural members shall not sag, split or buckle. 
(3)  Exterior surfaces and materials. Shall not have holes, wide cracks and loose, warped, protruding or rotting boards or any other condition admitting moisture. Exterior surfaces shall be repaired and weatherproofed, where appropriate, to protect them from further deterioration. Masonry joints shall be maintained.

(c)  Failure to provide minimum maintenance and repair. Owners shall not allow historic properties and places, sites, buildings, structures or works of art within designated historic districts to deteriorate by failing to provide minimum maintenance and repair. The failure to provide minimum maintenance and repair not only adversely impacts the historic and cultural value of the historic community, but due to decay, deterioration and structural defects, jeopardizes structural integrity and poses additional safety hazards. This section is to require an owner to engage in the minimum maintenance and repair necessary to correct decay, deterioration, structural defects and safety problems. 
(d)  Monitoring of condition. The commission and the city shall monitor the condition of all designated historic properties and places, sites, buildings, structures and works of art within designated historic districts. The commission shall report all failures to provide minimum maintenance and repair to the building official of the city. Such conditions as those outlined above shall constitute a failure to provide minimum maintenance and repair. 
(e)  Condition assessment. Upon notification by the commission, the building official or his designee shall be authorized to enter upon premises for the purpose of making examinations and inspections regarding conformity to the requirements hereunder. Such entry shall be made in such a manner as to cause the least possible inconvenience to any persons in possession. The city may appoint and affix the duties of such agents, designees and employees as reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter. The building official shall prepare a condition assessment for the commission. 
(f)  Notice and remedy time allowance. If the commission finds a failure to provide minimum maintenance and repair, in nonconformity with the above requirements, the commission will give notice as described herein and set forth the steps necessary to remedy the situation. Notice shall be served upon the owner and all parties in interest. The owner of the property will have ten days from receipt of such notice to respond in writing and outline his intentions and steps being taken to remedy the situation. The owner of the property will have 30 days from the receipt of such notice to begin the steps necessary to remedy the situation, and shall have 90 days from receipt of the notice to complete the work, unless such time shall be extended due to the expense and/or complexity of the repairs. In no event shall such extension exceed 90 additional days. 
(g)  Public hearing and recommendation of action. Within 30 days of receipt of the notice provided for above, the owner or any other party in interest who takes exception to such notice may request a public hearing on the matter. The owner or other party with an interest shall then be given an opportunity to appear before the commission, in person or otherwise, and present testimony pertaining to the notice issued. Notice of the date, time and place of the hearing shall be given via certified mail. The rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law or equity shall not be controlling in hearings before the commission, although all parties shall be provided a fair and impartial hearing and shall be entitled to present all relevant evidence. If the commission agrees with the original notice, it shall state its reasons for doing so, and shall transmit a recommendation of action and reasons in support thereof, in writing, to the affected party and to the mayor and council.

ARTICLE VII. - COMMUNITY TREE MANAGEMENT 

Sec. 7-261. - Title. 
There is hereby established a community tree management ordinance chapter for the City Code, also known as the "Tree Ordinance". 
(Former § 7-011(1.)) 
Sec. 7-262. - Purpose and intent. 
The purpose of the tree ordinance is to promote a healthy and sustainable community forest in the city for the benefit of citizens, visitors, and business owners. Trees, especially large, canopy trees, provide many economic, environmental, and social benefits to our community. Trees produce oxygen and help reduce the amount of airborne pollutants; they provide shade, lower air temperatures, reduce low level ozone production, and improve air quality. Trees reduce energy usage and costs. Trees reduce stormwater runoff and soil erosion, decrease sedimentation in streams and rivers, and improve water quality. Trees reduce glare and soften the harsh lines of pavement, buildings, and other hardscape. Trees increase property values. Trees improve human health and enhance outdoor recreation opportunities. Trees provide food and shelter for wildlife. Because trees provide these and other important and irreplaceable benefits, the city has adopted these regulations which contain minimum requirements for tree conservation, protection, establishment, maintenance, inspection, and removal. 
(Former § 7-011(2.)) 
Sec. 7-263. - Administration. 
The city manager or designee shall be the administrator of this article.

Sec. 7-272. - Tree canopy cover. 
The city desires a healthy and sustainable tree canopy well-distributed in the city. To achieve this, tree canopy cover goals are hereby established for the city including city property and previously developed private property and tree canopy cover requirements are hereby established for new developments and any activity on real property that requires the issuance of a land development permit. 
(1)  Tree canopy cover goals. The city's tree canopy cover goals are listed in Table 1. The purpose of these goals is to guide citizen, business, and non-governmental group activities toward contributing to a healthy and sustainable community forest and high quality of life within the city. 
TABLE 1. TREE CANOPY COVER GOALS 

 
(2)  Tree canopy cover requirements. 
a.  For any development that requires a land development permit a minimum amount of tree canopy cover is required on site as set forth in Table 2. The tree canopy cover requirements vary by zoning district, take into account the maximum allowable lot coverage, and are represented as a percent of the entire site area exclusive of large truck traffic and storage areas in Zones I-1 and I-2. 
b.  In addition to the overall minimum requirement, a minimum amount of tree canopy cover shall originate from the conservation of existing trees if adequate trees are present on the site. When no trees are present on a site or an inadequate number of trees are present on a site, then the tree conservation portion of the tree canopy cover requirements shall be satisfied through the establishment of additional trees. 
c.  Satisfactory compliance with tree canopy cover requirements shall be required before a certificate of occupancy can be issued. 
TABLE 2. MINIMUM TREE CANOPY COVER AND  CONSERVATION REQUIREMENTS 

 
* Applies to entire site area exclusive of truck traffic and storage areas. 
(3)  Existing tree canopy cover credit. The amount of tree canopy cover that shall be credited to an existing tree is the actual tree canopy cover as measured in the field or the standard tree canopy cover credit for the species found in the tree species list, whichever is greater. 
a.  Only healthy trees that will be protected per the administrative and technical standards are eligible for tree canopy cover credit. The determination of whether a tree is healthy shall be made by the administrator, who may seek, or require the applicant to provide, an opinion of a certified arborist or registered forester. Tree canopy cover credit will not be given to unhealthy trees or trees with greater than 35 percent crown dieback or trees that are not structurally sound and at risk for whole or partial tree failure. 
b.  Individually growing healthy canopy trees 18 inches DBH and larger that will be protected according to the administrative and technical standards are eligible to receive three times the maximum tree canopy cover as described above at the reasonable objective discretion of the tree board based on written criteria and findings of fact. 
c.  The tree canopy cover credit assigned to a tree to be established on a site is based on the tree canopy size category for the species defined in the tree species list in the administrative and technical standards. Species with the potential for large tree canopies are eligible for a credit of 1,600 square feet of tree canopy cover; trees with medium-sized canopies are eligible for a credit of 900 square feet of tree canopy cover; trees with small canopies are eligible for a credit of 400 square feet of tree canopy cover; and trees with very small canopies are eligible for a credit of 150 square feet of tree canopy cover. 
(4)  Tree conservation requirements. To satisfy tree conservation requirements individual trees may be conserved, groups of trees may be conserved, or natural, forested areas may be conserved. Individual trees proposed for conservation must be at least six inches DBH. Tree conservation must comply with the administrative and technical standards. Trees that are conserved must be protected per the administrative and technical standards. 
(5)  Protection and maintenance of tree canopy cover. The required amount of tree canopy cover on a site must be present on the site in perpetuity, with the exception of single- and two-family residential properties in new subdivisions once construction is complete and the property is owner-occupied. 
a.  Tree conservation areas for which credit has been received shall always remain as tree conservation areas. No activities that disturb the soil or vegetation can take place within tree conservation areas except the planting of trees. 
b.  Tree protection zones must be established around all individual conserved trees prior to site disturbance and must remain until construction has been completed and the certificate of occupancy has been issued. Tree protection structures shall be inspected and approved before site disturbance can begin. Standards for establishing tree protection zones and installing tree protection structures are described in the administrative and technical standards. 
c.  Trees established to satisfy tree canopy cover requirements shall be regularly maintained and remain healthy to continue to receive credit. If the city determines at any time prior to or after the certificate of occupancy has been issued that a tree has been topped or is not healthy, the city shall require the owner to remove and replace the tree to maintain the required minimum amount of tree canopy cover. 
(6)  Payment and penalties to the city tree fund in lieu of conservation or canopy coverage. In cases where adequate trees exist on a site but an inadequate number of trees are proposed for conservation, and after all options for conservation have been exhausted by the applicant, then the city may waive or reduce the minimum tree conservation requirement but shall require in lieu of conservation a contribution to the city tree fund as specified in the administrative and technical standards. Waiver shall be per reasonable objective discretion of the tree board based on written criteria and findings of fact. 
When a violation of this article exists and a fine is levied the fine shall be paid to the city tree fund. 
a.  When the city has wholly or partially waived the tree conservation requirement, a contribution to the city tree fund in lieu of the conservation shall be required in the amount of $300.00 for every 1,600 square feet of tree canopy cover not conserved. 
b.  When the city has wholly or partially waived the tree canopy cover requirement, a contribution to the city tree fund in lieu of the tree canopy cover shall be required in the amount of $300.00 for every 1,600 square feet of canopy not established. 
c.  When a city tree is damaged or destroyed the person responsible for the damage is required to reimburse the city for the value of the tree as described in this article; the reimbursement shall be deposited to the city tree fund. 
(7)  Tree establishment. The remainder of the tree canopy cover requirement in Table 2 shall be satisfied through new trees in frontage landscape strips and parking areas first, and then in other areas on the site where adequate space and growing conditions exist. 
a.  Trees in required buffers may count toward the overall tree canopy cover requirement, if the requirements for frontage landscape strips and parking areas have been met. 
b.  When planting more than three trees on a development site, no more than 30 percent of the trees may be of one single genus (oaks, maples, elms, etc.). 
c.  At time of planting, trees shall be a minimum of two inches caliper for canopy, upright and single-stemmed trees, and five feet tall for small, spreading or multi-stemmed trees. 
(8)  Trees in frontage landscape strips. Trees shall be established in all street frontage landscape strips at a density of one tree for every 40 linear feet of frontage. The largest tree that the growing space can accommodate shall be planted. Required trees may be established in city street rights-of-way with the permission of the tree board. Tree establishment shall conform to the administrative and technical standards. 
(9)  Trees in parking areas. To provide shade for pavement and vehicles and reduce summer temperatures and ozone, canopy trees shall be planted in parking areas at a rate of one tree for every 3,500 square feet of parking area. Trees shall be evenly distributed throughout the parking area in landscape islands so that 50 percent tree canopy cover will be achieved when the trees reach maturity. Trees planted around the perimeter of parking areas shall count for one-half of a tree for satisfying this requirement since only one-half of their canopy will cover pavement. These perimeter trees, however, retain full canopy cover credit for the purpose of satisfying overall tree canopy cover requirements. 
(10)  Minimum permeable soil area. 
a.  The minimum permeable soil areas that must be maintained around trees in paved areas or compacted soils are based on mature tree height category and are as follows: 
1.  Small trees: 100 square feet (minimum dimension five feet). 
2.  Medium trees: 225 square feet (minimum dimension nine feet). 
3.  Large trees: 400 square feet (minimum dimension nine feet). 
b.  These minimum permeable areas may be reduced by 50 percent if permeable pavement is installed around the CRZ of the trees or structural soils are installed beneath the pavement, in an area equal to the required minimum before reduction, as further described in the administrative and technical standards. 
c.  When two or more trees are planted in the same contiguous area, the amount of the combined minimum permeable areas may be reduced by ten percent for each additional tree, but in no case shall be reduced by greater than 50 percent overall. 
d.  The minimum permeable open soil area in parking lots for a large maturing tree may be reduced to the size of two parking bays, or a minimum of 324 feet. 
e.  Minimum permeable CRZ areas around established trees must always remain permeable and shall remain covered in mulch as described in the administrative and technical standards. 
(11)  Soil quality. Soil in the minimum permeable soil area of all trees to a depth of 30 inches must be good quality topsoil, well aerated, and composed of approximately 45 percent mineral soil, five percent organic matter and 50 percent pore space. 
(12)  Removal of trees from development sites. No trees may be disturbed, damaged, destroyed, or removed from a site prior to approval of a tree conservation plan, except for timber harvesting that is part of ongoing forest management operations (see timber harvesting ordinance). When timber harvesting occurs on a site without an approved tree conservation plan, no development permits of any type shall be issued for the site for five years after completion of harvesting. 
(Former § 7-011(13.)) 
Cross reference— Timber harvesting—Required notice; bonds or letters of credit, § 7-9.

State Law reference— Similar provisions, O.C.G.A. § 41-2-7. 
Sec. 7-304. - Unlawful to own structures or property not compliant with this section. 
(a)  It is the duty of the owner of every dwelling, building, structure or property in the city to construct and maintain such dwelling, building, structure or property in conformance with this section and all applicable codes in force in the city including such regulations which regulate and prohibit activities on property and which declare it to be a public nuisance to construct or maintain any dwelling, building, structure or property in violation of such codes or regulations. 
(b)  It shall be unlawful and a misdemeanor for any owner to own any dwelling, building, structure or property which: is unfit for human habitation or is unfit for its current commercial, industrial or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes, or is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes, or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, or is otherwise in violation of this section. 
(Former § 7-012(4.)) 
Sec. 7-305. - Enforcement procedure. 
(a)  When a request is filed with the public officer by a public authority or at least five residents of the city charging that any dwelling, building, structure or property is unfit for human habitation or for commercial, industrial or business use or when it appears to the public officer (on his own motion) that any dwelling, building, structure or property is unfit for human habitation or is unfit for its current commercial, industrial or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes, or is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes, or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the public officer shall make an investigation or inspection of the specific dwelling, building, structure, or property. 
If the officer's investigation or inspection identifies that any dwelling, building, structure, or property is unfit for human habitation or for commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes, or is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes, or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the public officer may issue a complaint in rem against the lot, tract, or parcel of real property on which such dwelling, building, or structure is situated or where such public health hazard or general nuisance exists. The following described action shall then be taken. 
The officer shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner and any parties in interest in such dwelling, building, structure or property summons and a complaint containing a notice that a hearing will be held in municipal court not less than 15 days nor more than 45 days after the serving of the complaint; that the owner and any parties in interest shall be given the right to file an answer to the complaint and to appear in person, or by attorney, and give testimony at the place and time fixed in the complaint. 
The complaint shall identify the subject real property by appropriate street address and official tax map reference; identify the owner and parties in interest; state with particularity the factual basis for the action; and contain a statement of the action sought by the public officer to abate the alleged nuisance. 
(b)  If, after the hearing, the court determines that the dwelling, building, structure, or property under consideration is unfit for human habitation or is unfit for its current commercial, industrial or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; or is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result or unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the court shall state in writing its findings of fact in support of such determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner and any parties in interest that have answered the complaint or appeared at the hearing an order: 
(1)  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of such dwelling, building, structure, or property can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, structure, or property, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter or improve such dwelling, building, structure, or property so as to bring it into full compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violation and, if applicable, to secure the structure so that it cannot be used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or 
(2)  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of such dwelling, building, structure, or property in order to bring it into full compliance with applicable codes relevant to the cited violations cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, structure, or property, requiring the owner within the time specified in the order, to remove or demolish such dwelling, building or structure and all debris from the property. 
(3)  If the court finds there is a condition or use of real estate other than addressed above, which renders adjacent real estate unsafe or inimical to safe human habitation and the court further finds that such use is dangerous and injurious to the health, safety and welfare of the people and that a public necessity exists for the repair of such condition or the cessation of such use, the court may order the cleaning or removal of debris, trash and other materials present and accumulated which create a health or safety hazard in or about any dwelling, building or structure, and the order may require the abatement of the public health hazard or general nuisance to eliminate the endangerment to the public health or safety. 
For the purposes of this Code section, the court shall make its determination of "reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building or structure" without consideration of the value of the land on which the structure is situated; provided however, that costs of the preparation necessary to repair, alter, or improve a structure may be considered. Income and financial status of the owner shall not be a factor in the court's determination. 
The present value of the structure and the costs of repair, alteration, or improvement may be established by affidavits of real estate appraisers with a Georgia appraiser classification as provided in O.C.G.A. tit. 43, ch. 39A, qualified building contractors, or qualified building inspectors without actual testimony presented. Costs of repair, alteration, or improvement of the structure shall be the cost necessary to bring the structure into compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violations in force in the city. 
(c)  If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair, alter, improve or demolish the dwelling, building, structure, or property, or to abate the nuisance to eliminate the endangerment to the public health or safety, the public officer may cause such dwelling, building, structure, or property to be repaired, altered or improved or to be vacated and closed or demolished. Such abatement action shall commence within 270 days after the expiration of time specified in the order for abatement by the owner. Time during any court stay on abatement shall not count toward said 270 days. The public officer shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of the building, dwelling, structure, or property a placard with the following words: 
"This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business use and does not comply with the applicable codes or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful." 
(d)  The amount of the cost of any repair, alteration, improvement, removal or demolition, including all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the tax commissioner, and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, including restoration to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be a lien against the real property upon which cost was incurred. Credit for salvaged materials sold, per subsection (e) below, shall be given. Such lien shall attach to the real property upon the filing of a certified copy of the order in the office of the clerk of Walton County Superior Court and shall relate back to the date of the filing of the lis pendens notice required under this section. 
The clerk shall record and index such order in the deed records and enter the lien on the general execution docket. The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except liens for taxes, and shall continue in force until paid. After filing the order with the clerk, and within 90 days of the repair, demolition or closure, the public officer shall forward a copy of the order and notice given to the owner and parties in interest and a final settlement of costs to the county tax commissioner. 
It shall be the duty of the county tax commissioner to collect the amount of the lien in conjunction with the collection of ad valorem taxes on the property per O.C.G.A. § 48-5-359.1, and to collect the amount of the lien as if it were a real property ad valorem tax, using all methods available for collecting real property ad valorem taxes, including specifically O.C.G.A. tit. 48, ch. 4; provided, however, that the limitation of O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 which requires 12 months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure shall not apply. 
The tax commissioner shall remit the amount collected to the city. Thirty days after imposition of the lien, the unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties in the same amount as interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes. 
(e)  If the dwelling, building or structure is removed or demolished by the public officer, reasonable efforts shall be made to salvage and sell reusable materials at private or public sale, and the proceeds of such sale shall be credited against the cost of the removal or demolition, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Such sale may be made without public advertisement and bid. The public officer and city shall have no liability related to such sale, including due to defects. Nothing in this section shall be construed to impair or limit in any way the power of the city to define and declare nuisances and to cause their removal or abatement by summary proceedings or otherwise. 
(f)  The city may waive and release any such lien imposed on property upon the owner of such property entering into a contract with the city agreeing to a timetable for rehabilitation of the real property or the dwelling, building, or structure on the property and demonstrating the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation. 
(g)  The redemption amount shall be the full amount of costs as determined above, plus interest, penalties and costs incurred by the city and the tax commissioner in the enforcement of such lien. Redemption of property shall be per O.C.G.A. §§ 48-4-80, 48-4-81.

Sec. 8-5. - Trucks over six wheels prohibited on roads designated "No Through Trucks". 
Trucks over six wheels are prohibited from using roads designated by the city manager as "No Through Trucks", which designation shall be ratified by vote of the mayor and council at the next council meeting after said designation by the manager. Such designation is permissible when such trucks are expressly found to be incompatible with the normal and safe movement of traffic in that area. The purpose of this restriction is to protect the public safety in the use of the city's streets, to facilitate and expedite traffic, and to protect the streets from unusual wear and damage. The mayor and council have control and supervision over its roads and streets. This prohibition is based on a traffic engineering investigation and recommendation. 
This prohibition shall be posted with appropriate signage so as to apprise drivers of trucks that such trucks are prohibited in areas designated "No Through Trucks". The signage shall be in proper position and sufficiently legible to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Any law enforcement officer or code enforcement officer to whom law enforcement authority has been designated who observes a motor vehicle being operated upon a public road of the state and who has reason to believe that any provision hereof is being violated is authorized to stop such vehicle and make investigation of such. 
Exemption. Trucks making a delivery to an address on the "No Through Trucks" road, with documentation proving such delivery, are permitted on the "No Through Trucks" road solely for that limited purpose, and shall depart by the shortest route to a road that is not designated "No Through Trucks". Provided, however, the maximum total gross weight of a vehicle and load shall not exceed 56,000 pounds. 
Initial designation. The following roads are hereby designated as "No Through Trucks" to protect the public safety in the use of the city's streets, to facilitate and expedite traffic, and to protect the streets from unusual wear and damage:

Chapter 9 - GENERAL OFFENSES 
ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 9-1. - Discharging firearms. 
It shall be unlawful for any person to discharge any firearm except in the defense of person or property. However, shotgun discharge by persons age 16 years or older, with 12 gauge or smaller shotgun (no magnum loads, buckshot, slugs, 3.5" loads or similar), is allowed as follows: during the hours of 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. on weekdays, on one's owned or leased property, and more than 250 feet from property lines and roadways. The shotgun may only be aimed above 30 degrees from horizontal, and never in the direction of any residence. No pistols, revolvers, muzzleloaders, rifles or similar firearms discharging a bullet or ball or slug are allowed in said firearm discharge. Only shotguns may be used, and only #6, #7.5, #8 and similar shot, known as birdshot or target loads, may be used. 
Furthermore, on larger acreage tracts, wherein neighbor property lines and roadways are at least 200 yards from the location where the gun is to be discharged, all shotguns and shotgun loads are allowed. Muzzleloaders, carbines chambered in pistol rounds and handguns are allowed as well. .22 caliber rimfire rifles (.22 lr, .22 magnum, etc.) are permitted, but larger high pressure rifle calibers, .223 level muzzle energy and up, are prohibited due to the danger of using high powered rifles within the city limits. Provided, however, that .30-30 Winchester, .444 Marlin, .45-70, .35 Remington, and other medium pressure rounds with round nose bullets and similar ballistics are permitted due to their limited range. Such non-shotgun firearm discharge, on larger acreage tracts, wherein neighbor property lines and roadways are at least 200 yards from the location where the gun is to be discharged, may only occur in an elevated area wherein shots shall be in a downward direction. In no case under this exception language may a gun be discharged in the general direction of any residential properties. In other words, the discharge must be towards the interior of the parcel, not towards the closest property line. 
Any person violating any of the provisions hereof shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction shall be fined up to $500.00 or be incarcerated for up to ten days, or both. Each day such violation is committed shall be a separate offense. 
This Code section shall not apply to authorized officers of the law and animal control officers in the performance of their law enforcement duties and/or animal control duties. Nor shall it apply to any lawful state sanctioned hunt.

c.  Without provocation, uses to or of another person in such other person's presence, opprobrious or abusive words which by their very utterance tend to incite to an immediate breach of the peace, that is to say, words which as a matter of common knowledge and under ordinary circumstances will, when used to or of another person in such other person's presence, naturally tend to provoke violent resentment, that is, words commonly called "fighting words"; or 
d.  Without provocation, uses obscene and vulgar or profane language in the presence of or by telephone to a person under the age of 14 years which threatens an immediate breach of the peace.

Unless flight by the person or other circumstances make it impracticable, a law enforcement officer shall, prior to any arrest for an offense under this Code section, afford the person an opportunity to dispel any alarm or immediate concern which would otherwise be warranted by requesting the person to identify himself and explain his presence and conduct.

(Former § 9-008) 
Sec. 9-5. - Graffiti. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. O.C.G.A. § 17-15A-2 and following are followed and enforced by the city. O.C.G.A. § 17-15A-3 notes that criminal street gang activity is a serious and continuing public safety concern; criminal trespass and criminal damage to property in the second degree caused by graffiti being placed unlawfully upon private property are crimes frequently associated with criminal street gang activity; and it is in the public interest, not only in the pursuit of justice but also as a means of combating such criminal street gang activity and of contributing to the general public welfare by improving the esthetics of public views, to compensate as provided in this section those private property owners who are the innocent victims of such criminal trespass or criminal damage to property in the second degree by using inmate labor to remove or obliterate graffiti unlawfully placed on private properties when such graffiti is visible from public roads or other public property. Per O.C.G.A. § 17-15A-4, the city authorizes the use of labor by inmates from any penal institution or jail under its authority to remove or obliterate such unlawfully placed graffiti when such graffiti is visible from any public road or other public property. Graffiti is detrimental to the public health, safety and general welfare and constitutes a public nuisance destructive of the right and values of property owners and the entire community. Graffiti is often associated with gang activity and it harms the esthetics of public views. It promotes blight and must be abated to avoid detrimental impact and to prevent the further spread of graffiti. Without prompt removal, other properties become the target of graffiti, and entire neighborhoods are affected and become less desirable places to live and work. 
(b)  Public nuisance. Graffiti is a public and private nuisance and may be abated per this section and other applicable laws. 
(c)  Definitions. 
Graffiti means any inscriptions, words, figures, paintings, or other defacements that are written, marked, etched, scratched, sprayed, drawn, painted, or engraved on or otherwise affixed to any surface of real property or improvements thereon without prior authorization of the owner or occupant of the property by means of any aerosol paint container, broad-tipped marker, gum label, paint stick, graffiti stick, etching equipment, brush, or other device capable of scarring or leaving a visible mark on any surface. City-approved signage is exempt. 
Occupant means any person or sub-lessee, successor or assignee that has control over property. 
Owner means any person, agent or entity having a legal or equitable interest in a property. 
Permit means knowingly allowing graffiti or any failure, refusal or neglect to remove. 
Property means any real or personal property and that which is affixed incidental or appurtenant to real property but not limited to any premises, house, building, fence, structure or any separate part thereof, whether permanent or not. 
(d)  Prohibited acts. It is unlawful to apply graffiti or for any owner or occupant to permit graffiti on property. 
(e)  Notice of removal. The city may serve a written notice directing the owner/occupant to remove such graffiti and advising of the appeal procedure. The notice may be served in person or by U.S. Mail, return receipt requested. If the owner/occupant cannot be found, the notice may be served by posting in a conspicuous place on the property for three days. 
(f)  Abatement of nuisance. It shall be unlawful for the owner/occupant to fail to remove the graffiti within five days of notice if service is made in person or by certified mail. If service is made by posting, the owner/occupant shall remove the graffiti within five days of the first day that the property is posted. 
(g)  Appeal. An appeal may be taken to the city council by the owner/occupant to prevent the removal of any graffiti, within five days of notice from the city. Appeals shall be in writing and state the reasons for the appeal. The city shall not remove or obscure any graffiti during the pendency of an appeal. If the party filing the appeal requests a hearing, such hearing shall be held within 45 days. If the city council determines the graffiti must be removed, such must be accomplished within ten days of the hearing. 
(h)  Removal. If the graffiti is not completely removed by the owner/occupant within the ten days, the city may have it removed, and the city and/or its private contractor or inmates may enter upon such premises to remove such graffiti. If the owner/occupant applied the graffiti, the owner/occupant shall be liable to the city for all such expenses. The city shall record the expenses incurred in abating graffiti and shall provide a statement of such costs to the owner/occupant. If any expenses remain unpaid after 30 days, the city may sue in a court of competent jurisdiction to recover all such expenses incurred by the city in removing the graffiti, including attorney fees and court costs associated with the action. 
(i)  Penalty. Any person convicted of violating this section may be punished by a fine of $500.00 to $1,000.00 per instance, plus may be required to reimburse the city for the expenses to remove the graffiti. The court may suspend or probate a portion or its entire sentence upon such conditions to include but not be limited to the restoring of the property so defaced, damaged or destroyed, or other remedial action. 
(j)  Alternate means of enforcement. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent the city from commencing any other available civil or criminal proceedings to abate a public nuisance under state law or city ordinance as an alternative, or in addition to, proceedings set forth in this section.

(6)  The city, in its reasonable discretion, may objectively consider any extenuating circumstances that may reflect favorably or unfavorably on the applicant, application or the proposed location of the business. If in the reasonable judgment of the city circumstances are such that the granting of the license would not be in the best interest of the general public, such circumstances may be grounds for denying the application.

It is the finding of the mayor and council that adult entertainment establishments, particularly those where alcoholic beverages are served, result in an increase in criminal behavior and create undesirable community conditions. An increase in instances of disorderly conduct, public drunkenness, prostitution, drug trafficking and loitering of individuals with criminal histories has been the experience of other counties and municipalities that permit adult entertainment establishments, particularly those in which alcoholic beverages are served. The mayor and council also find that the increase in criminal behavior which accompanies adult entertainment establishments causes undesirable community conditions. Conditions experienced in other counties and municipalities are depression of property values in neighborhoods surrounding the adult entertainment establishment, community blight, an increased burden on and expenditure for law enforcement, and an increase in the criminal case load in the judicial system due to a greater number of arrests because of the above-mentioned crime problems. 
In addition to the prohibitions under state law at O.C.G.A. § 3-3-41, no alcoholic beverages may be sold in any restaurant which features performances by topless dancers, go-go dancers, strippers or similar entertainers whose performances involve erotic dancing including without limitation the simulation of sexual activities and/or erotic or lewd touching.

ARTICLE V. - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT ESTABLISHMENTS 

Sec. 10-176. - Findings, public purposes. 
(a)  Findings. Based on experiences of other counties and municipalities, which experiences are relevant to problems faced by the city the council notes the conditions and occurrences generally associated with adult entertainment establishments. It is the finding of the council that adult entertainment establishments, particularly where alcoholic beverages are served, result in an increase in criminal behavior and create undesirable community conditions. An increase in disorderly conduct, public drunkenness, prostitution, drug trafficking and loitering of individuals with criminal histories has been the experience of other counties and municipalities that permit adult entertainment establishments, particularly those in which alcoholic beverages are served. 
The council also finds that the increase in criminal behavior which accompanies adult entertainment establishments causes undesirable community conditions. Conditions experienced in other counties and municipalities are depression of property values in neighborhoods surrounding the adult entertainment establishment, community blight, an increased burden on and expenditure for law enforcement, and an increase in the criminal case load in the judicial system due to a greater number of arrests because of the above mentioned crime problems. 
(b)  Purposes. The purpose of this article is to regulate adult entertainment establishments to prevent increases in criminal activity and undesirable community conditions.

(Former § 11-003) 
Sec. 11-2. - Identify theft prevention program. 
(a)  Short title. This section shall be known as the Identify Theft Prevention Program. 
(b)  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to comply with 16 CFR § 681.2 to detect, prevent and mitigate identity theft by identifying and detecting identity theft red flags and by responding to such red flags in a manner that will prevent identity theft. 
(c)  Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the following definitions apply: 
Covered account means: 
(1)  An account that a financial institution or creditor offers or maintains, primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, that involves or is designed to permit multiple payments or transactions, such as a credit card account, mortgage loan, automobile loan, margin account, cell phone account, utility account, checking account, or savings account, and 
(2)  Any other account that the financial institution or creditor offers or maintains for which there is a reasonably foreseeable risk to customers or to the safety and soundness of the financial institution or creditor from identity theft, including financial, operational, compliance, reputation, or litigation risks. 
Credit means the right granted by a creditor to a debtor to defer payment of debt or to incur debts and defer its payment or to purchase property or services and defer payment therefor. 
Creditor means any person who regularly extends, renews, or continues credit; any person who regularly arranges for the extension, renewal, or continuation of credit; or any assignee of an original creditor who participates in the decision to extend, renew, or continue credit and includes utility companies and telecommunications companies. 
Customer means a person that has a covered account with a creditor. 
Identity theft means a fraud committed or attempted using identifying information of another person without authority. 
Person means a natural person, a corporation, government or governmental subdivision or agency, trust, estate, partnership, cooperative, or association. 
Personal identifying information means a person's credit card account information, debit card information bank account information and drivers' license information and for a natural person includes their social security number, mother's birth name, and date of birth. 
Red flag means a pattern, practice, or specific activity that indicates the possible existence of identity theft. 
Service provider means a person that provides a service directly to the city. 
(d)  Findings. The city is a creditor pursuant to 16 CFR § 681.2 due to its provision or maintenance of covered accounts for which payment is made in arrears. Covered accounts offered to customers for the provision of city services include utility accounts. The city has little or no previous experience with identity theft related to covered accounts. The processes of opening a new covered account, restoring an existing covered account, and making payments on such accounts have been identified as potential processes in which identity theft could occur. The city limits access to personal identifying information to those employees responsible for or otherwise involved in opening or restoring covered accounts or accepting payment for use of covered accounts. Information provided to such employees is entered directly into the city's computer system and is not otherwise recorded. There is a risk of identity theft occurring in the following ways: Use by an applicant of another person's personal identifying information to establish a new covered account; use of a previous customer's personal identifying information by another person in an effort to have service restored in the previous customer's name; use of another person's credit card, bank account, or other method of payment by a customer to pay such customer's covered account or accounts; and use by a customer desiring to restore such customer's covered account of another person's credit card, bank account, or other method of payment. 
(e)  Process of establishing a covered account. As a precondition to opening a covered account in the city, each applicant shall provide the city with personal identifying information of the customer, for example, a valid government issued identification card containing a photograph of the customer or, for customers who are not natural persons, a photograph of the customer's agent opening the account. Such applicant shall also provide any information necessary for the department providing the service for which the covered account is created to access the applicant's consumer credit report. Such information shall be entered directly into the city's computer system and shall not otherwise be recorded. Each account shall be assigned an account number and may be assigned a personal identification number (PIN) which shall be unique to that account. The city may utilize computer software to randomly generate assigned PINs and to encrypt account numbers and PINs. 
(f)  Access to covered account information. Access to customer accounts shall be password protected and shall be limited to authorized city personnel. Such password(s) shall be changed on a regular basis, shall be at least eight characters in length and shall contain letters, numbers and symbols. Any unauthorized access to or other breach of customer accounts is to be reported immediately to the city manager and the password changed immediately. Personal identifying information included in customer accounts is considered confidential and any request or demand for such information shall be immediately forwarded to the city manager and the city attorney. 
(g)  Credit card payments. If credit card payments that are made over the Internet are processed through a third party service provider, such third party service provider shall certify that it has an adequate identity theft prevention program in place that is applicable to such payments. All credit card payments made over the telephone or the city's website shall be entered directly into the customer's account information in the computer data base. Account statements and receipts for covered accounts shall include only the last four digits of the credit or debit card or the bank account used for payment of the covered account. 
(h)  Sources and types of red flags. All employees responsible for or involved in the process of opening a covered account, restoring a covered account or accepting payment for a covered account shall check for red flags as indicators of possible identity theft and such red flags may include: 
(1)  Alerts from consumer reporting agencies, fraud detection agencies or service providers. Examples of alerts include but are not limited to: A fraud or active duty alert that is included with a consumer report; a notice of credit freeze in response to a request for a consumer report; a notice of address discrepancy provided by a consumer reporting agency; indications of a pattern of activity in a consumer report that is inconsistent with the history and usual pattern of activity of an applicant or customer, such as: A recent and significant increase in the volume of inquiries; an unusual number of recently established credit relationships; a material change in the use of credit, especially with respect to recently established credit relationships; or an account that was closed for cause or identified for abuse of account privileges by a financial institution or creditor. 
(2)  Suspicious documents. Examples of suspicious documents include: Documents provided for identification that appear to be altered or forged; identification on which the photograph or physical description is inconsistent with the appearance of the applicant or customer; identification on which the information is inconsistent with information provided by the applicant or customer; identification on which the information is inconsistent with readily accessible information that is on file with the financial institution or creditor, such as a signature card or a recent check; or an application that appears to have been altered or forged, or appears to have been destroyed and reassembled. 
(3)  Suspicious personal identification, such as suspicious address change. Examples of suspicious identifying information include: Personal identifying information that is inconsistent with external information sources used by the financial institution or creditor. For example: The address does not match any address in the consumer report; or the Social Security Number (SSN) has not been issued, or is listed on the Social Security Administration's Death Master File. Personal identifying information provided by the customer is not consistent with other personal identifying information provided by the customer, such as a lack of correlation between the SSN range and date of birth. Personal identifying information or a phone number or address, is associated with known fraudulent applications or activities as indicated by internal or third-party sources used by the financial institution or creditor. Other information provided, such as fictitious mailing address, mail drop addresses, jail addresses, invalid phone numbers, pager numbers or answering services, is associated with fraudulent activity. The SSN provided is the same as that submitted by other applicants or customers. The address or telephone number provided is the same as or similar to the account number or telephone number submitted by an unusually large number of applicants or customers. The applicant or customer fails to provide all required personal identifying information on an application or in response to notification that the application is incomplete. Personal identifying information is not consistent with personal identifying information that is on file with the financial institution or creditor. The applicant or customer cannot provide authenticating information beyond that which generally would be available from a wallet or consumer report. 
(4)  Unusual use of or suspicious activity relating to a covered account. Examples of suspicious activity include: Shortly following the notice of a change of address for an account, city receives a request for the addition of authorized users on the account. A new revolving credit account is used in a manner commonly associated with known patterns of fraud patterns. For example: the customer fails to make the first payment or makes an initial payment but no subsequent payments. An account is used in a manner that is not consistent with established patterns of activity on the account. There is, for example: Nonpayment when there is no history of late or missed payments; a material change in purchasing or spending patterns; an account that has been inactive for a long period of time is used (taking into consideration the type of account, the expected pattern of usage and other relevant factors). Mail sent to the customer is returned repeatedly as undeliverable although transactions continue to be conducted in connection with the customer's account. The city is notified that the customer is not receiving paper account statements. The city is notified of unauthorized charges or transactions in connection with a customer's account. The city is notified by a customer, law enforcement or another person that it has opened a fraudulent account for a person engaged in identity theft. 
(5)  Notice from customers, law enforcement, victims or other reliable sources regarding possible identity theft or phishing relating to covered accounts. 
(i)  Prevention and mitigation of identity theft for existing accounts. In the event that any city employee responsible for or involved in restoring an existing covered account or accepting payment for a covered account becomes aware of red flags indicating possible identity theft with respect to existing covered accounts, such employee shall use his or her discretion to determine whether such red flag or combination of red flags suggests a threat of identity theft. If, in his or her discretion, such employee determines that identity theft or attempted identity theft is likely or probable, such employee shall immediately report such red flags to the city manager. If, in his or her discretion, such employee deems that identity theft is unlikely or that reliable information is available to reconcile red flags, the employee shall convey this information to the city manager, who may in his or her discretion determine that no further action is necessary. If the city manager in his or her discretion determines that further action is necessary, a city employee shall perform one or more of the following responses, as determined to be appropriate by the city manager: 
Contact the customer; if, after contacting the customer, it is apparent that someone other than the customer has accessed the customer's covered account: change any account numbers, passwords, security codes, or other security devices that permit access to an account or close the account; Cease attempts to collect additional charges from the customer and decline to sell the customer's account to a debt collector in the event that the customer's account has been accessed without authorization and such access has caused additional charges to accrue; Notify a debt collector within three working days of the discovery of likely or probable identity theft relating to a customer account that has been sold to such debt collector in the event that a customer's account has been sold to a debt collector prior to the discovery of the likelihood or probability of identity theft relating to such account; Notify law enforcement, in the event that someone other than the customer has accessed the customer's account causing additional charges to accrue or accessing personal identifying information; or Take other appropriate action to prevent or mitigate identity theft. 
(j)  Prevention and mitigation of identity theft for new accounts. In the event that any city employee responsible for or involved in opening a new covered account becomes aware of red flags indicating possible identity theft with respect an application for a new account, such employee shall use his or her discretion to determine whether such red flag or combination of red flags suggests a threat of identity theft. If, in his or her discretion, such employee determines that identity theft or attempted identity theft is likely or probable, such employee shall immediately report such red flags to the city manager. If, in his or her discretion, such employee deems that identity theft is unlikely or that reliable information is available to reconcile red flags, the employee shall convey this information to the city manager, who may in his or her discretion determine that no further action is necessary. If the city manager, in his or her discretion determines that further action is necessary, a city employee shall perform one or more of the following responses, as determined to be appropriate by the city manager: Request additional identifying information from the applicant; deny the application for the new account; notify law enforcement of possible identity theft; or take other appropriate action to prevent or mitigate identity theft. 
(k)  Updating the program. The city council shall periodically review and, as deemed necessary by the council, update the identity theft prevention program along with any relevant red flags in order to reflect changes in risks to customers or to the safety and soundness of the city and its covered accounts from identity theft. In so doing, the city council shall consider the following factors and exercise its discretion in amending the program: The city's experiences with identity theft; updates in methods of identity theft; updates in customary methods used to detect, prevent, and mitigate identity theft; updates in the types of accounts that the city offers or maintains; and updates in service provider arrangements. 
(l)  Program administration. The city clerk is responsible for oversight of the program and for program implementation. The city manager is responsible for reviewing reports prepared by staff regarding compliance with red flag requirements and with recommending material changes to the program, as necessary in the opinion of the city manager, to address changing identity theft risks and to identify new or discontinued types of covered accounts. Any recommended material changes to the program shall be submitted to the city council for consideration by the council. The city clerk will report to the city manager at least annually, on compliance with the red flag requirements. The report will address material matters related to the program and evaluate issues such as: The effectiveness of the policies and procedures in addressing the risk of identity theft in connection with the opening of covered accounts and with respect to existing covered accounts; service provider arrangements; significant incidents involving identity theft and management's response; and recommendations for material changes to the program. The city clerk is responsible for providing training to all employees responsible for or involved in opening a new covered account, restoring an existing covered account or accepting payment for a covered account with respect to the implementation and requirements of the identity theft prevention program. The city clerk shall exercise his or her discretion in determining the amount and substance of training necessary. 
(m)  Outside service providers. In the event that the city engages a service provider to perform an activity in connection with one or more covered accounts the city clerk shall exercise his or her discretion in reviewing such arrangements in order to ensure, to the best of his or her ability, that the service provider's activities are conducted in accordance with policies and procedures, agreed upon by contract, that are designed to detect any red flags that may arise in the performance of the service provider's activities and take appropriate steps to prevent or mitigate identity theft. 
(Former § 11-004) 
Sec. 11-3. - Treatment of address discrepancies. 
(a)  Short title. This section shall be known as Treatment of Address Discrepancies. 
(b)  Purpose. Pursuant to 16 CFR § 681.1, the purpose of this section is to establish a process by which the city will be able to form a reasonable belief that a consumer report relates to the consumer about whom it has requested a consumer credit report when the city has received a notice of address discrepancy. 
(c)  Notice of address discrepancy means a notice sent to a user by a consumer reporting agency pursuant to 15 U.S.C. § 1681(c)(h)(1), that informs the user of a substantial difference between the address for the consumer that the user provided to request the consumer report and the address(es) in the agency's file for the consumer. 
(d)  Policy. If the city receives a notice of address discrepancy, the city employee responsible for verifying consumer addresses for the purpose of providing the municipal service or account sought by the consumer shall perform one or more of the following activities, as determined to be appropriate by such employee: 
Compare the information in the consumer report with: Information the city obtains and uses to verify a consumer's identity in accordance with the requirements of the Customer Information Program rules implementing 31 U.S.C. § 5318(l); information the city maintains in its own records, such as applications for service, change of address notices, other customer account records or tax records; or information the city obtains from third-party sources that are deemed reliable by the relevant city employee; or verify the information in the consumer report with the consumer. 
(e)  Furnishing consumer's address to consumer reporting agency. If the city reasonably confirms that an address provided by a consumer to the city is accurate, the city is required to provide such address to the consumer reporting agency from which the city received a notice of address discrepancy with respect to such consumer. This information is required to be provided to the consumer reporting agency when: The city is able to form a reasonable belief that the consumer report relates to the consumer about whom the city requested the report; the city establishes a continuing relation with the consumer; and the city regularly and in the ordinary course of business provides information to the consumer reporting agency from which it received the notice of address discrepancy. Such information shall be provided to the consumer reporting agency as part of the information regularly provided by the city to such agency for the reporting period in which the city establishes a relationship with the customer. 
(f)  Methods of confirming consumer addresses. The city employee charged with confirming consumer addresses may, in his or her discretion, confirm the accuracy of an address through one or more of the following methods: Verifying the address with the consumer; reviewing the city's records to verify the consumer's address; verifying the address through third party sources; or Using other reasonable process.

Combined sewer means a sewer receiving both surface runoff and sewage. 
Garbage means solid wastes from the domestic and commercial preparation, cooking and dispensing of food, and from the handling, storage and sale of produce. 
Industrial wastes means the wastes from industrial manufacturing processes, trade or business as distinct from sanitary sewage. 
Natural outlet means any outlet into a watercourse, pond, ditch, lake or other body of surface or groundwater. 
pH means the logarithm of the reciprocal of the weight of hydrogen ions in grams per liter of solution. 
Properly shredded garbage means the wastes from the preparation, cooking and dispensing of food that have been shredded to such a degree that all particles will be carried freely under the flow conditions normally prevailing in public sewers, with no particle greater than one-half inch, or 1.27 centimeters, in any dimension.

(Former § 11-002(2)) 
Sec. 11-53. - Use of public sewers required. 
(a)  Sanitary disposal of wastes. It shall be unlawful for any person to place, deposit or permit to be deposited in any unsanitary manner on public or private property, any human or animal excrement, garbage or other objectionable waste. 
(b)  Untreated sewage/other polluted waters. It shall be unlawful to discharge to any natural outlet within the city, any sewage or other polluted waters, except where suitable treatment has been provided in accordance with subsequent sections of this article. 
(c)  Septic tanks. Except as hereinafter provided, it shall be unlawful to construct or maintain any privy, privy vault, septic tank, cesspool or other facility intended or used for the disposal of sewage. 
(d)  Toilet facilities required.

Stubs are defined as the connection from the structure to the city main. All property owners should install backflow prevention devices to avoid raw sewage backflow. 
Since most blockages occur in stubs rather than city lines, property owners should normally contact a private plumbing company rather than the city if they identify a problem with their sewer system. The plumbing company and/or property owner should contact the city public works department only after it has been determined that the problem appears to be in the city line rather than the privately owned system. 
Upon contact from a plumbing company or property owner indicating a problem in the city owned line, a public works department crew will be dispatched to determine if the blockage is in city lines and, if appropriate, eliminate the blockage. The superintendent, or his designated representative, will normally make a determination as to whether or not the problem is/was in the city owned line. If the blockage is not in the city owned line, the property owner or plumbing company will be advised and the property owner will be responsible for correcting the problem and for all damages.

To the extent applicable, the materials and procedures set forth in appropriate specifications of the A.S.T.M. and W.P.C.F Manual of Practice No. 9 shall apply. 
(g)  Gravity flow desirable. Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the building at an elevation below the basement floor. In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such building drain shall be lifted by an approved means and discharged to the building sewer. 
(h)  Surface runoff prohibited. No person shall make connection of roof downspouts, exterior foundation drains, areaway drains, or other sources of surface runoff or groundwater to a building sewer that in turn is connected directly or indirectly to a public sanitary sewer. 
(i)  Building codes to be followed. The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall conform to the requirements of this Code pertaining to the building and plumbing codes, and the administration thereof, adopted by the city. All such connections shall be made gas tight and water tight. Any deviation from the prescribed procedures and materials must be approved by the building inspector in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Code.

Sec. 12-6. - Sidewalk cafes. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this division is to provide for regulation of sidewalk cafes operated by qualified restaurants on public sidewalks, and to more fully promote the public interest by contributing to a viable and attractive commercial and pedestrian environment. In recognition thereof, reasonable regulation of sidewalk cafes is necessary to protect the public health, safety, and welfare, and the interest of the city and the primary use of the public streets and sidewalks by vehicular and pedestrian traffic.

City manager shall mean the city manager of the City of Social Circle and those to whom he delegates or assigns duties under this section, including but not limited to the Social Circle Downtown Development Authority.

Person shall mean both natural persons and legal persons such as corporations, partnerships or LLCs. 
(c)  Qualifications. The use of sidewalks for restaurant tables shall only be permitted incidental to the operation of a "restaurant" or "convenience store" as defined in appendix A, article III of the city zoning code. No permit is required unless the operator desires to sell alcohol on the sidewalk area. However, the use of the sidewalk to operate a sidewalk cafe is a privilege, not a right, and any person who violates the conditions of this section may be forbidden to operate a sidewalk cafe after notice and a hearing. A permit is required to sell alcohol on the sidewalk as set forth below. 
(d)  Temporary closing of sidewalk cafes. 
(1)  Sidewalk cafes may be ordered closed temporarily by the city whenever deemed necessary in the sole discretion of the city, whenever the area may be needed for a public purpose, including but not limited to construction, maintenance, public health, safety or welfare, emergencies, and public events such as parades or street parties.

Refuse shall not be disposed of in the city's sidewalk trash receptacles. The area shall be kept clear of all debris. The operator shall also be responsible for cleaning the ground or floor surface on which the sidewalk cafe is located and the gutter area immediately adjacent to the sidewalk cafe. Such cleaning may include pressure cleaning. If the area is not maintained in a neat and orderly appearance after notice, the city may then take steps necessary to place the property in a neat and clean order and charge the operator with the reasonable cost of cleaning or repairs. Such action by the city does not create a continuing obligation on the part of the city to make further repairs or to maintain the property and does not create any liability against the city for any damages to the property if such cleaning or repairs were completed in good faith. 
(5)  No tables, chairs, or any other parts of sidewalk cafes shall be attached, chained or in any manner affixed to any tree, post, sign or other fixture, curb, or sidewalk in or near the permitted area. 
(6)  Only the area in front of a restaurant, as defined by projecting its interior width outward perpendicular to the street to a point at which it intersects the roadway (or within the sidewalk frontage of the building where the validly licensed restaurant is located provided that written approval is supplied by the building owner) can be used by the restaurant.

The operator shall provide indemnification to the city in writing on a form provided by the city manager.

This coverage shall not be less than $500,000.00 per occurrence. 
(3)  It shall not be lawful to operate a sidewalk cafe at any time the insurance required by this section is not maintained and evidence of its continuance filed with the city. 
(g)  Revocation. The privilege of an operator to use the sidewalk of the city may be revoked at any time by written notice to be served on the operator; such service to be by certified mail or personal service. Upon receipt of such revocation notice, the permittee shall have ten days to appeal such revocation to the mayor and council, whose decision after notice and hearing as required by the governing mayor and council section of this Code shall be final. 
(h)  Sale of alcoholic beverages at sidewalk cafe. Only a properly permitted restaurant with a sidewalk cafe, which holds a valid alcohol license for consumption on the premises, may serve alcohol to customers in the sidewalk cafe, subject to the following restrictions:

(3)  Patrons must be seated while consuming an alcoholic beverage.

In addition to the normal alcohol permit requirements, this includes a requirement of a scale drawing of the exact area that may be used for serving alcohol on the public sidewalk as an exception to the open container laws of the state. 
(j)  Right to limit or deny admission or service. Within the designated area of a cafe, the operator holding a permit under this section shall have the right to limit access and occupancy to only bona fide paying customers of that operator's restaurant who are behaving in a lawful manner. 
(k)  Penalties. In addition to losing the privilege of operating a sidewalk cafe, any person, firm, corporation or agent, servant, employee, officer or contractor for any person, firm or corporation who shall violate any provision, requirement, term, or condition of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and each day of such violation shall constitute a separate offense. The performance of any act prohibited by any section or provision of this section, or the failure to perform any act required thereby, shall constitute a violation and an offense hereunder and any person found guilty of a violation of any section or provision of this section shall be punished as provided under the jurisdiction of the municipal court of the city and may be punished with a fine up to $1,000.00 and as set forth in other provision of this Code.

(e)  Wrecker services shall be required to be available via listed phone numbers 24 hours a day, seven days a week with adequate manpower to respond to calls immediately.

(2)  It shall be deemed an offense under this section if a wrecker service accepts a call for service from a police dispatcher, but fails to arrive on the scene 15 minutes beyond the maximum response time. Response time shall be measured from the time the wrecker service operator accepts the call for service from the police dispatcher. 
In any 12-month period, if a wrecker service is found to be in noncompliance with the response time standards of this division, the wrecker service shall be notified by the city police department and provided with written notice of such noncompliance and removed from the appropriate call lists according to the following schedule:

If a conflict of interest is determined to exist, it shall be documented in writing and the wrecker service shall be prohibited from joining or remaining on the police department rotating call lists.

ARTICLE II. - USE OF PUBLIC PROPERTY AND ROADS FOR PARADES, FILMING, ETC. 

Sec. 12-26. - Basis for this article. 
(a)  Requests by private entities to use public property. Private organizations and groups of private persons have from time to time sought to use public property and public roads within the city for private purposes. Such uses have included parades, television and/or movie filming, advertisement filming, road closings and other related activities. 
(b)  Private uses of public property should not interfere with safety.

After examining the application and receiving the advice and assistance of any other officer named herein, the manager, after consideration of the facts reported in the application and any such advice and assistance from another public officer as herein provided, including prior experiences involving the same or similar activity, may require, as a condition for the issuance of the permit, that a fee be paid in an amount reasonably necessary to provide for, among other things, clean up after the event, special first aid or medical resources, security for vehicles at any staging area, special traffic considerations, toilet facilities, and similar special expenses occasioned by the activity. This amount shall not exceed $1,000.00.

If additional requirements are placed on organizations or groups in accordance with this subsection, and those requirements are not met, then said failure to comply with the requirements shall be grounds for denial of any subsequent permit requested by said organization or group and for any claims for funds expended by the city for those expenses agreed to but not provided by the applicant. 
(d)  Individuals may be excused from security deposit requirements. If the organization be other than individuals, a permit will not be issued without the making of the necessary deposit; individuals may be excused from such a deposit on account of indigence upon execution under oath by the individual applicant, or by each individual in a group applying for a permit, of a pauper's affidavit.

Sec. 15-26. - Intent and purpose. 
Pursuant to the Charter of the city, it is empowered to regulate roadside areas, including rights-of-way.

Per O.C.G.A. §§ 36-76-1 et seq. known as the "Consumer Choice for Television Act" of 2007, the city retains regulatory powers over certain activity of cable and video providers with respect to public rights-of-way within or belonging to the city. Per O.C.G.A. §§ 46-5-1 et seq. telephone companies shall comply with all applicable local laws and regulations, including municipal ordinances and regulations, regarding the placement and maintenance of facilities in the public rights-of-way that are reasonable, nondiscriminatory, and applicable to all users of the public rights-of-way within or belonging to the city. The city desires to establish reasonable nondiscriminatory regulations for the installation construction, maintenance, renewal, removal and relocations of utility facilities that are not more restrictive than equivalent regulations promulgated by the Georgia Department of Transportation with respect to utilities on the state highway system under authority of O.C.G.A. § 32-4-70. Therefore, the city, under the authority of the laws and Constitution of the State of Georgia, including but not limited to Article 9, Section 1, Paragraph 1 of the Georgia Constitution, O.C.G.A. §§ 36-1-20 and O.C.G.A. 32-4-42(6), has adopted the ordinance from which this chapter derives for the purpose of regulating public and private entities which use the city rights-of-way.

Any information of an engineering nature shall be certified by a licensed professional engineer. 
11.  Each applicant for a tower and/or antenna shall also provide an inventory of its existing towers that are either within the city or one-fourth mile thereof, including specific information about the location, height, and design of each tower. The city may share such information with other applicants applying for land use approvals and permits under this ordinance or other organizations seeking to locate antennas within the city. However, the city is not, by sharing such information, representing or warranting that such sites are available or suitable. 
12.  The planning commission and council shall consider the following factors in determining whether to issue a conditional use permit for a telecommunication facility: 
a)  Height of the proposed tower; 
b)  Proximity of the tower to residential structures and residential district boundaries; 
c)  Type of uses on adjacent and nearby properties; 
d)  Surrounding topography; 
e)  Design of the tower, particularly as to visual obtrusiveness; 
f)  Proposed ingress and egress; 
g)  Availability of suitable existing towers and other structures as discussed above; and 
h)  Whether the tower is designed to accommodate additional antennas. 
13.  All decisions by the city or its officials regarding a request to place, construct or modify a telecommunications tower or antenna shall be in writing and supported by a written record documenting the reasons for the denial and the evidence in support thereof. All such decisions shall be made within a reasonable time from the date a completed application is duly filed with the appropriate department. Applications in all cases where the telecommunications tower or antenna is an authorized use shall be made to and decided by the mayor and council upon review and recommendations of an Engineer pursuant to all standards and requirements herein. 
14.  Co-location of antennas is encouraged. Each applicant for a telecommunications tower or antenna shall provide to the city an inventory of existing towers that are either within the jurisdiction of Social Circle or within one-quarter mile of the boundaries thereof, including information regarding the location, height, and design of each tower. The city may share such information with other applicants applying for conditional use permits under this ordinance or with other organizations seeking to locate antennas within the jurisdiction of Social Circle, provided, however, that the city is not, by sharing such information, in any way representing or warranting that such sites are available or suitable. No new tower shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of Social Circle that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna. Evidence shall be submitted at the time of application which demonstrates that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna and may consist of the following: 
a)  No existing towers or structures are located within the geographic area required to meet the applicant's engineering requirements. 
b)  Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to meet applicant's engineering requirements. 
c)  Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment. 
d)  The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the existing towers or structures or the antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the applicant's proposed antenna. 
e)  The fees, costs or contractual provisions required by the owner in order to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower or structure for sharing are unreasonable. 
f)  The applicant demonstrates other limiting factors that render existing towers and structures unsuitable. 
15.  All transmission towers installed after the effective date of this ordinance shall be structurally and mechanically capable of accommodating the antenna or array of antennae of more than one user/transmitter, unless the tower is incapable of supporting more than one user/transmitter due to the design of the tower which is incorporated into another structure in compliance. Monopoles shall accommodate a minimum of two total users, lattice or other types of towers shall accommodate a minimum of three total users. To ensure structural integrity, towers and antennas shall be maintained in compliance with the building code and the current applicable standards published by the Electronic Industries Association. If the city concludes that a tower or antenna fails to comply and/or constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon notice to the owner, the owner shall have thirty days to bring such tower or antenna into compliance. If the owner fails to do so, the city may remove such tower or antenna at the owner's expense. Any such removal shall be as provided in O.C.G.A. §§ 41-2-8 through 41-2-17. 
16.  To further encourage co-location, additional users and associated equipment which do not add to the tower height, may be added without additional approval. However, additional building code regulations may apply. Site plans must show the locations for at least two equipment buildings, even if the tower is proposed for a single user. 
17.  Installation of an antenna on an existing alternative tower structures (a building, sign, light pole, water tower, or other free-standing non-residential structure) 50 feet tall or greater is permitted, subject to zoning district restrictions. 
18.  The placement of additional buildings or other supporting equipment necessarily required in connection with an otherwise authorized telecommunications tower or antenna is authorized. 
19.  Any telecommunications tower or antenna that is not operated for a continuous period of six months shall be considered abandoned and the owner of such antenna or tower shall remove same within 90 days of receipt of notice by Social Circle notifying the owner of such abandonment.

o.  Sufficient setback shall be provided from all property lines and public highways to assure adequate lateral support for the maintenance of adjacent public and private property. No disposal area shall be permitted closer than 400 feet from the interior boundary lines. Disposal areas shall at no time be permitted where adjoining lateral support for the maintenance of adjoining land is not maintained. 
p.  Hours of operation of any landfill shall be no greater than 7:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. Monday to Friday. No operation is allowed on Saturday or Sunday. A sign clearly indicating the hours of operation and prohibiting dumping at all other times shall be placed in a conspicuous location at the entrance. Disposal facilities shall have qualified personnel on duty at all times to direct the dumping, spreading, compaction, and covering of materials. All such personnel shall reside in close enough proximity to respond in the event of a fire. 
q.  All litter shall be collected from the landfill site by the end of each working day and either placed in the fill, compacted and covered that day, or stored in a covered container. 
r.  Any landfill shall be open to use by residents, property owners, and businesses, during established business hours, at a rate to be agreed upon by the mayor and council. Special handling fees may be charged for bulky or difficult to process items. 
s.  A mitigation trust fund shall be established at a bank within the city chosen by the mayor and council. The operator shall pay $5.00 per ton of waste disposed into this trust fund for the life of the landfill. Expenditures from the trust fund are to be approved by a committee consisting of one citizen appointment by the mayor and council, the mayor, and one representative of the owner/operator. Funds may be used, without limitation, for off-site litter control, groundwater and surface water monitoring, provision of alternative water supplies, and payments to adjacent property owners and others, at the discretion of the committee, for damages caused as a result of the landfill or its related operations.

(Ord. No. 2017-11, Exh. A, 6-20-2017) 
Sec. 706A. - Corridor overlay. 
1.  Purpose. The mayor and council of the city hereby declare it to be the purpose and intent of this regulation to establish a uniform procedure for the protection, enhancement, perpetuation, and use of the North Cherokee Road and South Cherokee Road Corridor and Social Circle Parkway and North Cherokee Road and South Cherokee Road and Social Circle Parkway Corridor ("Corridors") in Social Circle, as the corridor has a direct impact on places, districts, sites, buildings, structures, and works of art with special historical, cultural, or aesthetic interests or values. Suburban sprawl and roadside commercial developments, when set into a traditional quasi-rural community with valuable historic buildings such as Social Circle, can produce an adverse effect on city character and quality of life. Conventional planning models and zoning ordinances can produce linear development, homogeneous architecture, large expanses of asphalt and a proliferation of signage. 
Careful planning, particularly along heavily traveled and developed corridors such as the corridors, can allow new developments to be successfully blended into the existing city without compromising the unique character of Social Circle. The purpose of this ordinance is to implement the development of appropriate regulations and planning techniques to protect Social Circle's entry corridor along the corridors. The city also seeks to enhance open space conservation. 
The mayor and council recognize commercial strip development spawns traffic congestion, extensive and competing signage and incompatible architecture. In order to preserve Social Circle's rural ambiance and historic elements, guidelines are necessary to prevent the emergence and expansion of long linear commercial strips within the corridors. The primary goal of this ordinance is to protect the character of these gateways while utilizing appropriate standards and criteria to direct future development in harmony with the city. The objectives also include the safe and efficient use of the roadways, and the encouragement of quality, sensible development in harmony with the rural character and historic elements of Social Circle. A further purpose is limitation on linear shopping centers and the parking lots associated therewith. The construction of new, smaller scale traditional buildings along the roadside and frontage can assist in achieving the desired effect by buffering views of asphalt lots. 
The city also seeks to enhance open space conservation, by taking a parcel of land, calculating the number of lots by conventional zoning, then reducing the buildable land and reducing lot sizes accordingly. The remaining undeveloped land may be set aside as a permanent conservation easement or for non-commercial use. 
The city wishes to focus upon the compatibility of forms, scale, massing and materials such that new structures will conform to neighboring community features and standards, and more closely reflect the rural character and historic elements of the community. New structures should be reasonably harmonious with existing traditional buildings in Social Circle and its rural surroundings. Height, mass and roof shape are important elements. More specifically, see the corridor guidelines herein. 
2.  Corridor commission. 
A.  The commission. The city planning commission shall function as the "Social Circle Corridor Commission."

Exterior architectural features: The architectural style, general design, and general arrangement of the exterior of a building or other structure, including, but not limited to, the kind of texture of the building material; the type and style of all windows, doors, and signs; and other appurtenant architectural fixtures, features, details, or elements relative to the foregoing. 
Fenestration: The spatial definition of the walls of a building. The facade of a building establishes a wall surface or plane. The degree to which that plane is visually segmented by bays and punctured by entrances and windows is fenestration. For example, historic commercial buildings have a high degree of fenestration and large, modern "big-box" sprawl stores have an extremely low degree of fenestration. Social Circle's architectural history is one of moderate to high fenestration. 
Interior: Landscaping areas within or partially within pavement areas for breaking up large expanses of pavement. Interior landscape areas include islands, peninsulas, or combinations thereof. 
Island: An interior landscaping area surrounded by pavement or structures. 
Landscape, frontage: Landscape areas between the front of the principal building(s) and adjacent street(s). 
Landscape, perimeter: Landscape area located between the side(s) and rear of the primary building(s) and adjacent property line(s). 
Material change in appearance: A change that will affect only the exterior features of a property or of any structure, site, or work of art within the corridors and may include any one or more of the following: 
(1)  A reconstruction or alteration of the size, shape, or facade of a property, including relocation of any doors or windows or removal or alteration of any architectural features, details, or elements; 
(2)  Demolition of a property; 
(3)  Commencement of excavation; 
(4)  A change in the location of advertising visible from the public way on the property; 
(5)  The erection, alteration, restoration, or removal of any building or other structures within the Corridors, including walls, fences, steps, and pavements, or other appurtenant features; or 
(6)  The relocation of a structure within the corridor or from a location outside the Corridor to a location within the corridor. 
Ornamentation: Decorative elements applied to a structure. 
Orientation: The direction a building's primary elevation (also known as facade) faces. 
Outparcels: A lot within a planned center or portion of a larger parcel that is reserved during development for sale and/or future development. In commercial areas, these lots are generally reserved along the frontage road for smaller business development. 
Person: Any natural person, corporation, LLC, unincorporated association, partnership or other entity. 
Setback: The distance from the property line to the building (this includes roof overhangs, porches, foundations, etc.). The front setback may encompass landscape areas, paved areas, building appurtenances, etc. 
Spacing: The distance between buildings located on adjoining parcels (thus including both side setbacks). 
Zoning and planning official: The individual designated by the city manager as responsible for implementation and enforcement of the applicable provisions of this section.

Sec. 706B. - Corridor standards. 
1.  Site planning. 
A.  General criteria for conceptual planning. 
(1)  Creative site planning alternatives, such as cluster development, reclamation, mixed-use enterprises, planned centers and open space zoning, should be utilized to offer alternatives to linear strip development. 
(2)  Significant cultural, historic, natural, and scenic features should be identified for preservation during the site planning process. 
(3)  Architectural design should not be developed independent of context. Buildings should be integrated with, not isolated from, their surroundings. All design elements, including without limitation buildings and appurtenances, landscape design and vegetation, parking, driveways, walkways, signage and lighting, should be coordinated to create a continuous and harmonious streetscape. Where possible, building appurtenances should be shared. 
(4)  Landscape design shall be an integral component. Retention of existing vegetation is encouraged. Adequate provision of new landscaping areas at the frontage, along the property perimeters, and within pavement areas is essential. Landscape plans should utilize preferred plant materials, establish planting sizes, and include irrigation and screened utilities. 
B.  Area specific criteria. 
(1)  Commercial corridors shall have an integrated streetscape of a scale and character consistent with city's traditional development pattern. Architectural design should be heavily influenced by city's historic and traditional commercial, industrial, and institutional properties. Landscape design shall accommodate pedestrian areas, with canopy street trees and ornamental plantings, limited frontage parking with adequate shade, reduced signage, and walkways connecting buildings with the public sidewalk network. 
(2)  Industrial corridors shall have an interconnected "corporate campus" appearance so roadways, while serving a functional and vital industrial community, remain attractive travel corridors for residents and visitors. Architectural design is less important than landscape design in these areas. However, facades should have some degree of ornamentation consistent with city's traditional structures. Landscape design should retain some of city's rural heritage through the conservation of greenspace frontage and perimeters, minimal frontage parking, limited signage, and adequate screening of loading/docking, storage, and refuse areas. 
2.  Architecture. 
A.  General criteria for conceptual planning. 
(1)  Architecture should reflect city's traditional and/or historic built environment, specifically in terms of scale, mass, form, materials, fenestration, and ornamentation (see definitions). 
(2)  Appropriate building orientation and setback are integral aspects of site planning, and should also be incorporated during architectural design. 
(3)  In areas where new structures are adjacent to and visible from roadways, architecture shall adhere to the standards set forth below. 
(a)  General. In general, new structures shall be designed consistent with traditional and historic features associated with the building type. 
(b)  Orientation. Most city buildings face the street. New construction should reflect this pattern. In instances of the use of an access road, the commission may consider alternative orientation proposals for buildings not visible from the public right-of-way. 
(c)  Setback. Historic commercial and institutional properties have very defined setbacks, and few properties deviate from this established facade line. Properties that deviate detract from the streetscape. New construction and redevelopment shall closely adhere to the established facade line. Although the setback may not be the same as in historic areas, similar setbacks create the desired harmonious streetscape such as that found in the historic district. 
(d)  Scale. One-story buildings are typical in most corridor areas, and these are preferred. The scale of the structure should be proportional to setback. 
(e)  Mass. A building's proportions will be compared with other buildings in the vicinity, and with the size of the lot. If a proposed building is over 10,000 square feet, or has a facade greater than 100 feet in length, then setbacks, fenestration, and other techniques shall be used to minimize the visual impact of the building. 
(f)  Form. New structures should be rectilinear forms generally. Post-modern, mall-like towers are inappropriate. Parapet roof forms are preferred, as large expanses of flat roofs should not be visible, and coverage of large expanses of roof with gable or hip forms makes the roof too prominent. 
(g)  Materials. Brick and wood siding are the most common traditional building materials in the city. Brick is the preferred exterior material. Materials having a wood siding appearance, such as hardiboard and hardiplank, are compatible substitutions provided that the proposed reveal is similar to that of existing historic examples. Aluminum and vinyl siding are not permitted. Stucco, not including E.I.F.S., is acceptable in limited areas (e.g. parapets) or as full exterior surface for architectural styles and forms reflecting city's historic architecture that traditionally utilized stucco (e.g. religious architecture, Art Moderne and Art Deco buildings). 
(h)  Fenestration. The spacing and placement of architectural bays and openings, and the solid-to-void ratio (wall-to-window), should conform to the general proportions characteristic of traditional buildings. Facades greater than 100 feet in length must incorporate wall plane projections or recesses thereby creating bays, said bays forming a different plane by at least one foot. No uninterrupted length of facade shall exceed 100 feet. The facade of a main building facing a public street shall feature at least one public entrance. Where a main building faces more than two public streets, an entrance for each side may be proposed. To avoid box-like buildings, windows and other features are important to obtain the traditional solid to void ratio. Facades that face public streets shall have arcades, display windows, entry areas, awnings, or other similar features along no less than 60 percent of their length. The ground floor facade must be transparent between the height of three feet and eight feet above the walkway grade for no less than 60 percent of the horizontal length of the building facade. Where additional establishments will be located within or adjacent to the principal building, the solid to void criteria set forth above apply to each individual facade. All windows shall be recessed and shall include visually prominent framing features. 
(i)  Ornamentation. Detailing found upon local buildings should serve as a model for new design elements, including but not limited to decorative masonry work, accent masonry, brackets, knee braces, etc. Limited use of glass block, alternative masonry blocks, stucco, and synthetic stucco may be considered for the creation of building details. Building facades should include a repeating pattern that shall include no less than three of the following elements: 1) color change, 2) texture change, 3) material module change (shape), or 4) expression of architectural or structural bay through a change in plane no less than one foot in width, such as an offset, reveal, or projecting rib. At least one of these elements shall repeat horizontally. All elements should repeat at intervals of not more than 30 feet, either horizontally or vertically. Recessed panels (also referred to as traditional signboard areas) should be incorporated into the fenestration and ornamentation if attached wall signs are proposed. 
B.  Area specific criteria. 
(1)  Commercial zoned. Properties less than three acres shall follow a frontage setback of 75 feet. Properties greater than three acres should reserve two or more outparcels for future development to insert buildings closer to the roadway. Where additional stores will be located within the main building, each such store shall have a least one exterior public entrance. 
(2)  Industrial zoned. Properties less than three acres shall have a frontage setback of 80 feet. Properties greater than three acres shall have a frontage setback of at least 120 feet. Buildings in this area may propose alternative building forms provided that all landscaping requirements are fully met. Alternative materials for elevations not visible from public areas may be presented. Only one public entrance is required, specifically on the elevation facing the primary road. Transparency of 60 percent of the horizontal length of the facade and recessed windows is imperative. 
3.  Pavement. 
A.  General criteria. 
(1)  A large area of asphalt parking without landscaping, adjacent to the roadway, is not permitted. The required alternative is side or rear parking and interspersed landscaping amid front parking spaces. 
(2)  Shared parking areas utilized by more than one building or business are encouraged to minimize large areas of pavement. 
(3)  Frontage pavement is to be limited, and screened by evergreen frontage vegetation. 
(4)  Developments along pedestrian corridors are required to construct public sidewalk, to be connected to any existing sidewalk. 
B.  Area specific criteria. 
(1)  Commercial zoned. Properties are limited to 42 feet of pavement, permitting one row of parking spaces and a passing lane, between the frontage landscape strip and the primary structure. Parking in the front yard shall not extend more than two spaces beyond either wall of the primary structure. Additional frontage parking for planned centers may be considered if the center has a front setback of at least 200 feet, all landscaping criteria are met, and the center features two or more frontage outparcels. A five-foot sidewalk must be installed six inches from the property line along the public road and along other sides of the lot that abut public streets. Generally the sidewalk should not be closer than three feet from the edge of pavement or curbing. 
(2)  Industrial zoned. Properties less than three acres are limited to 42 feet of pavement, permitting one row of parking spaces and a passing lane, between the frontage landscaping strip and the primary structure. Properties greater than three acres are limited to 60 feet of pavement between the frontage landscaping strip and the primary structure. Parking in the front yard shall not extend more than two spaces beyond either wall of the primary structure. Parking and loading areas for trucks and heavy equipment do not require interior landscaping if located entirely behind the primary structure and screened from the public road by an evergreen buffer at least 12 feet in height at maturity. 
4.  Landscape. 
A.  General criteria. 
(1)  Landscape planning shall be integrated with the overall planning concept for any project. Therefore, the commission shall evaluate landscape plans as to relationship to the existing landscape. The commission shall also consider landscapes on adjacent properties and public rights-of-way, and the existing and proposed building(s). 
(2)  Outparcels must meet all landscaping requirements in addition to those met by the larger development. 
(3)  In addition to the tree regulations and other applicable regulations, the following standards apply. 
(a)  Existing landscape. Existing tree cover and natural vegetation shall be preserved, whenever possible, or replaced with suitable vegetation. All existing, healthy deciduous and hardwood trees with a caliper of five or more inches at a point three feet above ground shall be retained, whenever feasible. If not feasible the tree shall be replaced with the same or similar type of tree, unless otherwise approved by the commission. 
(b)  Required screening, buffering, and landscaping. Landscaping shall divide and break up the expanse of paving. Screening and buffering of objectionable views or nuisances, such as service areas, refuse containers, air conditioning units, transformers, etc., is required. Seventy-five percent of frontage landscaping must be evergreen or perennial plant materials. Frontage strips adjacent to pavement deeper than 42 feet must be screened by 100 percent evergreen shrubbery and the use of berms, where appropriate. 
(c)  Irrigation. Irrigation shall be installed and maintained as per approved irrigation plan. In industrial corridors, waiver of irrigation requirements may be considered by the commission for existing enterprises and developments located on parcels over three acres provided that any bond that may be required by the zoning ordinance is provided. 
(d)  Vegetation and coverage. All vegetation shall be proposed, installed, and maintained in accordance with the zoning ordinance. The minimum landscape buffer coverage is the sum of the areas required to meet all landscaping buffer requirements set forth below. In addition to landscape buffer coverage, the minimum quantity of trees must meet the requirements of the tree ordinance. 
(i)  Frontage. A landscape buffer is required along all public rights-of-way, permitting only the encroachment of driveways necessary to serve the property. Trees within the frontage area must meet the requirements of the tree ordinance, and be overstory, deciduous and/or hardwood trees. Trees may be grouped or established in a jagged line. 
(ii)  Perimeter. A landscape buffer is required alongside and rear abutting property that is not public right-of-way. 
(iii)  Interior. Interior landscape buffer areas are required for all parking lots with six or more spaces. Not less than ten percent of the interior of the parking lot must be landscaped. Islands must meet the requirements of the tree ordinance. No portion of an island less than three feet in width may be counted in the area. Landscape areas must meet the requirements of the tree ordinance back-to-back parking bays, separated by landscape areas, are encouraged. One in four parking rows should be divided by a landscape area at least 15 feet in width. At least 75 percent of the trees located within interior landscape areas must be overstory, deciduous and/or hardwood trees. 
(iv)  Corner. Corner landscape areas are required for those properties located on the corners formed by the North (and future South) intersection(s) of North Cherokee Road and South Cherokee Road Corridor and Social Circle Parkway and the North Cherokee Road and South Cherokee Road and Social Circle Parkway Corridor, and the intersection of the North Cherokee Road and South Cherokee Road and Social Circle Parkway and East Hightower Trail. These corners form unique entries or "gateways" leading to the heart of the city. Owners of said properties shall install and maintain the corner landscape areas utilizing the established gateway requirements, or the city may accept a planting and maintenance easement provided that the owner extends and maintains the irrigation system. The easement shall be within the established setback. In consideration for said easement, the commission may offer mitigation of site plan and landscape planning for said corner properties, provided that the corner landscape areas meet the gateway requirements. 
B.  Specific criteria. 
(1)  Commercial zoned. Frontage landscape buffers must be at least 20 feet in depth. The other perimeter landscape buffers must be at least ten feet in depth. Sod is required for front yard grass areas of all properties. 
(2)  Industrial zoned. For properties less than three acres, frontage landscape buffers must be at least 25 feet in depth; perimeter landscape buffers must be at least 12.5 feet in depth. Sod is required for front yard grass areas of all properties. For properties greater than three acres, frontage landscape buffers must be at least 100 feet in depth; perimeter landscape buffers must be at least 50 feet in depth. Sod is not required for properties above three acres, provided that primary areas are sprigged or seeded. 
5.  Reserved. 
6.  Illumination. 
A.  General criteria. 
(1)  Control. Lighting must be controlled in height, direction, and intensity for traffic safety and to maintain city's rural character. 
(2)  Awnings. No illumination of awnings is permitted. 
(3)  Reserved. 
(4)  Direction. Luminaries shall be shielded to prevent glare onto adjacent property. 
(5)  Intensity. A maximum light level of PL = 0.2 foot candles measured at ground level is permitted. Entrances to developments may be lighted exceeding 0.2 foot candles for traffic safety only. High intensity sodium vapor lights are prohibited.

ARTICLE VIII. - NONCONFORMING USES 

Sec. 800. - Continuance of nonconforming uses. 
The lawful, constitutional elimination of existing nonconforming structures and uses is as important a subject of health, safety and general welfare as is prevention of new uses that would violate the provisions of this ordinance. The lawful use of any structure or land at the time of the enactment or amendment of this ordinance may be continued, except the nonconforming use shall not be: 
1.  Extended to occupy a greater area of land. 
2.  Extended to occupy a greater area of a structure unless such additional area existed at the time of the passage of this ordinance and was clearly designed to house the same use as the nonconforming use occupying the other portion of the structure. 
3.  Re-established after discontinuance for one year. 
4.  Changed to another or different nonconforming use. 
(Ord. No. 2017-11, Exh. A, 6-20-2017) 
Sec. 801. - Continuance of a nonconforming building. 
Nothing in this article shall prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition any building or part thereof declared unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety or health. However, the same 50 percent provision of subsection 2. shall apply. A nonconforming building existing at the time of the enactment of this ordinance may be retained except as follows: 
1.  No building other than a single-family detached dwelling may be enlarged or altered except in conformance with this ordinance, but it may be repaired to the extent necessary to maintain it in a safe sanitary condition. Interior remodeling, including changing of interior partitions, is permitted for nonconforming buildings. 
2.  No building, other than a single-family detached dwelling, shall be rebuilt, altered or repaired after damage exceeding 50 percent of the replacement cost of the above-ground structure at the time of destruction, except in conformity with this ordinance, provided that such damage occurred as a result of fire or natural disaster. 
3.  Should a nonconforming building be voluntarily moved any distance, the nonconforming building and all nonconforming structures and personalty on the lot shall be eliminated within 60 days thereafter. 
(Ord. No. 2017-11, Exh. A, 6-20-2017) 
Sec. 802. - Amortization and discontinuance. 
Notwithstanding other provisions of this ordinance, certain nonconforming land uses, after this ordinance is enacted into law, shall be discontinued, and/or shall be torn down, altered, or otherwise made to conform with this ordinance within the time set forth below. The mayor and council, upon findings in the specific case, may permit not more than one extension for not more than the time indicated. The date that a nonconforming use must either comply or cease to exist shall be measured from the date of enactment of this ordinance. 

 
(Ord. No. 2017-11, Exh. A, 6-20-2017) 
Sec. 803. - Validity of previously issued permits and approvals. 
No provision of this zoning ordinance shall affect the validity of 1) any building or grading permit lawfully issued prior to this ordinance, provided that all time constraints for such permit shall be observed, or 2) any development permit lawfully authorized prior to this ordinance, upon approval of relevant construction drawings; and such development may proceed to record provided that all time constraints and conditions relating to the approval are observed, and that the lot size relating to the approval are observed, and that the lot size and construction of buildings shall be in accordance with the area and dimensional requirements existing on the date of such approval.

Sec. 905. - PUD Planned unit development district. 
The purpose of planned unit developments is to encourage the best possible site plans and buildings arrangement under a unified plan of development and a signed, written development agreement, rather than under lot-by-lot regulation. Planned unit developments include attached and detached dwelling units, which may include patio houses and cluster developments, with common open space. The public benefits from better land utilization, economy in the provision of roads and utilities, flexibility in design, variety in building types, compatibility of uses and optimum community development. Review of the development plan by the city planning commission and mayor and council provides an opportunity to assure that the development will be in harmony with the character of the area in which the development is located. Planned unit developments are not for greater density of development, but rather to encourage ingenuity and resourcefulness in land planning. The planned unit development is, furthermore, not intended to enhance the value of the property for speculative purposes. Approval of the planned unit development is therefore conditional, and if construction is not commenced within one year, and pursued in an orderly manner toward completion, the planning commission and mayor and council may, upon written notice to the property owner, initiate the rezoning process to change the zoning classification or reduce the size of the tract to fit the scope of actual development. 
A.  Ownership control. All of the land in a PUD shall be owned initially by an individual or by some legal entity. Individual properties within these developments may be sold after a plat has been recorded, with the properties subject to private deed covenants that assure the continuance of the planned unit development as originally approved and developed. 
B.  Standards applying to all planned unit developments. All PUDs shall meet the following standards and such other requirements as are set forth with respect to each proposed rezoning application. 
1.  Density shall not exceed eight units per gross acre. Density shall be reviewed in relation to density of developed property on nearby parcels, and the density for development of the immediate area as proposed within the land use element of the city comprehensive plan. 
2.  The development shall be compatible with topography of the land and preserve any unusual topographic or natural features. 
3.  The development shall not adversely affect developed or undeveloped neighboring properties. 
4.  The development shall utilize design and development features that would not be possible by the application of lot-by-lot zoning district regulations. 
5.  Preservation of existing forest land and open space shall provide for protection of water and wildlife resources. 
6.  Water, sewerage, and street facilities shall be adequate for the proposed development. 
7.  Yards. Yard requirements of the district shall be established by the approved site plan. Buffer zone requirements shall be met. 
8.  Height. The height limitation shall be established during the approval process and shall be established prior to any approval of a rezoning application. 
9.  Off-street parking and loading and unloading requirements: The off-street parking and loading and unloading requirements of this zoning ordinance shall be met. 
C.  Required exhibits for review of planned unit developments. To assure quality developments, to establish an optimum living environment between indoor and outdoor living, and to provide for good design and use of proper materials in the structures and landscape design, the professional talents of qualified architects, urban or regional planners and/or landscape architects shall be utilized to design the plans. The plans shall be completed and submitted to the city manager. No application shall be accepted for processing without these required exhibits. 
1.  A location map indicating existing zoning on the site and the adjacent areas. 
2.  A concept plan drawn no smaller than one inch equals 100 feet, including the following information:

c.  Topography with contour intervals no greater than ten feet; 
d.  Lakes, ponds and floodplains and the sources of floodplain data; 
e.  Stormwater detention areas; 
f.  Existing and proposed landscaping; 
g.  Recreation facilities (if applicable); 
h.  Stages of development, if any; 
i.  Location of off-street parking. 
3.  Floor plans and elevations of all typical units and any other structures such as recreation buildings.

b.  Lot sizes (dimensions and square footage); 
c.  Building heights and stories; 
d.  Building coverage for each lot; 
e.  Amount of common open space in square feet (if applicable); 
f.  All tree areas to be retained or added; 
g.  Parking facilities; 
h.  Such other architectural and engineering data as may be required to evaluate the project. 
D.  Uses in a PUD. Any use allowable in a conventional zoning district may be proposed for inclusion in a PUD. Each proposed use must meet all requirements of the zoning districts in which it is allowed. Only the specific uses approved shall be allowed in the PUD. Any addition of uses, change of plans, or increase in size or density shall require a separate application for amendment to the original approved PUD and shall follow the same process as any other zoning ordinance amendment. Initial approval of a PUD does not grant a vested right to subsequently proposed amendments. Unless otherwise stated in this section, approved development standards and land uses shall become the standards for the subject property and, as such, shall become a part of these zoning regulations. A PUD must have protective covenants for all property within the PUD. The protective covenants must be recorded in the office of the clerk of the superior court.

F.  Off-street parking. All off-street parking and parking lots shall be located in side or rear yards. No parking shall be allowed in the front setback. If parking is located in the side yard, it shall be screened by low walls, fences or hedges, three to five feet in height. Parking is prohibited in alleys. In a neighborhood center area on or off site community parking facilities are encouraged. In a mixed residential area, the required parking must be provided on site. 
G.  Special site requirements. The site proposed for PUD district classification must contain an area of ten acres or more, unless a smaller area is specifically approved by the planning commission and council due to special and unusual circumstances. In no case shall the lot size be less than five acres. The site must abut a public street for a distance of at least 100 feet.

A commercial use may not be open from 11:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. Residential uses in commercial buildings are permitted only above the first floor. Drive through facilities that permit people to remain in their vehicles while receiving services or products are prohibited, with the exception of fueling facilities of a service station. The retail uses shall be specified as a part of the proposal and shall be limited to a total of 10,000 square feet of gross floor area. Such uses may be proposed only on developments of five acres or more.

ARTICLE XIII. - SIGNS 

Sec. 1300. - Purpose. 
Regulation of the location, size, placement, and certain features of signs is necessary to enable the public to locate goods, services, and facilities in the city without difficulty and confusion, to improve the general attractiveness of the community, to take advantage of the beauty of the community's environment, and to protect property values. The goal of this article is to avoid being an impermissible content-based regulation, and instead to be a permissible time, place and manner restriction. More communication is desirable during the election cycle, so that all citizens may freely express their viewpoints during the election campaigns, and therefore this ordinance allows increased opportunities for signs during these periods, without limiting content. At all times, any sign permitted under this regulation can carry any legal message, political or non-political, commercial or non-commercial. However, it is not the intent of this article that all signs are built to the maximum size. The city encourages use of the minimum signage necessary to meet the purposes required. Accordingly, it is the intention of the city to establish regulations governing signs which will: 
1.  Promote and protect the public health, safety, and general welfare; 
2.  Protect the character of the city's historic commercial district and residential neighborhoods; 
3.  Enhance the economy of the city by promoting the reasonable, orderly and effective display of signs; 
4.  Restrict signs and lights which increase clutter or which increase the probability of traffic accidents by obstructing vision; 
5.  Promote signs compatible with their surroundings. 
Further, recognizing that the aesthetic, cultural, and historic qualities of the city are unique and, therefore, vital to the community's interest, it is the objective of this article to protect these and to ensure that these are not compromised. It is an objective of this article to protect and preserve the aesthetic qualities of the community by regulating the number, size, placement, installation and maintenance of signs. The fact that such signs are intended to command visual contact, grants to signs a proportionally greater role than other structures in determining the overall aesthetic quality of the community. 
The aesthetic impact of signs has an economic factor that can bear heavily upon the enjoyment and value of property; therefore, the regulation of signs is validly justified on the basis of conserving the value of property and encouraging the most appropriate use of land throughout the community. It is both rational and important for a community's citizens to plan their physical surroundings so unsightliness is minimized. Signs can detract from the beauty of a neighborhood and lower property values. 
In seeking to comply with federal and Georgia law, the city council has determined the following: large billboards are, as the U.S. Supreme Court has recognized, an aesthetic harm; the Georgia Supreme Court has upheld sign regulations on the basis of aesthetics and preserving the beauty of environment; and, judicial decisions of the Eleventh Circuit have recognized that portable signs are visual clutter and a potential traffic hazard. These holdings support the constitutionality of this chapter, as intended by the city. 
With these purposes in mind, it is the intention of this article to authorize the use of signs that: 
1.  Are compatible with their surroundings. 
2.  Are appropriate to the type of activity to which they pertain. 
3.  Are expressive of the identity of the individual properties or of the community as a whole. 
4.  Are legible. 
To avoid illegal signage, anyone contemplating a sign should contact the city and a private firm or individual engaged in sign/graphic design for advice.

Sec. 1302. - Scope of regulations. 
It shall be unlawful for any person to erect, construct, enlarge, move, alter, or convert any sign or cause the same to be done except per this article. Nothing herein shall be construed to permit display of any message which is obscene, illegal or speech which is otherwise unprotected under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit a prosecution for violation of a criminal statute by the city or other duly constituted government authority or a civil action by the city or other private person or entity.

The following standards governing the exercise of the city's zoning power are to be considered by the mayor and council and the planning commission in balancing the interest of the public health, safety, morality or general welfare against the unrestricted use of property: 
1.  The existing land use pattern; 
2.  The possible creation of an isolated district unrelated to adjacent and nearby districts; 
3.  The population density pattern and possible increase or over-taxing of the load on public facilities including, but not limited to, school, utilities, and streets; 
4.  The costs to the city and other governmental entities in providing, improving, increasing or maintaining public utilities, schools, streets, law enforcement, fire protection and other public services; 
5.  The possible impact on the environment, including, but not limited to drainage, soil erosion and sedimentation, flooding, air quality and water quality; 
6.  Whether the proposed zoning amendment will allow uses which will be a detriment to the value of adjacent property in accordance with existing regulations; 
7.  Whether there are substantial reasons why the property cannot be used and developed in accordance with the existing regulations; 
8.  The aesthetic effect of the existing and proposed use of the property as it relates to the surrounding area; 
9.  The extent to which the proposed zoning amendment is consistent with the comprehensive land use plan; 
10.  The possible effects of the proposed zoning amendment on the character of the zoning district, a particular piece of property, neighborhood, a particular area or the community as a whole; 
11.  The relationship that the proposed zoning amendment bears to the purpose of the overall zoning scheme, with due consideration given to whether or not the proposed zoning change will carry out the purposes of these zoning regulations; 
12.  Any application for a zoning map amendment which does not contain a specific site plan carries a rebuttable presumption that such rezoning shall adversely affect the zoning scheme; 
13.  The consideration of the preservation of the integrity of residential neighborhoods shall be considered to carry great weight; 
14.  In those instances in which property fronts on a major thoroughfare and also adjoins an established residential neighborhood, the factor of preservation in the residential neighborhood shall be considered to carry great weight; 
15.  Whether the property affected by the zoning decision has a reasonable economic use as currently zoned; and 
16.  Whether other conditions exist that affect the use and development of the property in question and support either approval or denial of the zoning action. 
After receiving the application for amendment, the report and recommendation of the planning commission, and other pertinent information, the mayor and council shall apply the evidence to the standards of review in making its decision. It will not be required that the planning commission or the mayor and council consider criteria contained in the standards of review which are inapplicable. It shall be the duty of the applicant to carry the burden of proof that the proposed zoning amendment promotes the public health, safety, morality or general welfare. In ruling on any application in which the petitioner has brought a challenge to the existing zoning classification, the mayor and council may impose upon said property any appropriate conditions, which might be consistent with the considerations contained above.

Subdivision. Any land, vacant or improved, which is divided or proposed to be divided into two or more lots, parcels, sites, units, plots, tracts, or interests for the purpose of offer, sale, lease, or development whether immediate or future, either on the installment plan or upon any and all other plans, teems, and conditions. "Subdivision" includes the division or development of residential and nonresidential zoned land, whether by deed, metes and bounds description, devise, intestacy, lease, map, plat, or other recorded instrument. "Subdivision" includes resubdivision creation or conversion. The definition of "subdivision" does not include the division of a tract or parcel of land into lots, building sites, or other divisions, all of which contain five acres or more, all accessed by and fronting on an existing paved public street and not requiring an extension of public utilities. There are two classifications of subdivisions, major and minor, as defined separately herein.

2.  Lot dimensions. Lot dimensions shall comply with the minimum standards of the zoning ordinance. Where lots are more than double the minimum required area of the zoning district, the mayor and council may require that those lots be arranged so as to allow further subdivision and opening of future streets where they would be necessary to serve potential lots, all in compliance with the zoning ordinance and this ordinance. In general, side lot lines shall be at right angle to street lines (or radial to curving street lines) unless a variation from this rule will give a better street or lot plan. Dimensions of corner lots shall be large enough to allow for erection of building, observing the minimum front-yard setback from both streets. Depth and width of properties reserved or laid out for business, commercial, or industrial purposes shall be adequate to provide for the off-street parking and loading facilities required for the type of use and development contemplated, as established in the zoning ordinance. 
3.  Lot orientation. The lot line common to the street right-of-way shall be the front line. All lots shall face the front line and a similar line across the street. Wherever feasible, lots shall be arranged so that the rear line does not abut the side line of an adjacent lot. 
4.  Front yard setback lines. A line meeting the front yard setback requirements of the zoning ordinance shall be established on all lots. Any projection beyond the front building line such as uncovered porches, steps, eaves, gutters, and similar fixtures shall be subject to provisions of the zoning ordinance and approved or disapproved by the city manager for each individual application. 
5.  Double frontage lots and access to lots. 
a.  Double frontage lots. Double frontage and reverse frontage lots shall be avoided except where necessary to provide separation of residential development from traffic arterials or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation. Double frontage lots which are necessary shall be required to have a no-access easement across them, preventing access to arterial or collector streets. 
b.  Access from major and secondary arterials. Lots shall not, in general, derive access exclusively from a major or secondary street. Where driveway access from a major or secondary street may be necessary for several adjoining lots, the mayor and council may require that such lots be served by a combined access drive in order to limit possible traffic hazards on the street. Where possible, driveways should be designed and arranged so as to avoid requiring vehicles to back into traffic on major and secondary arterials. 
6.  Soil preservation, grading, and seeding. 
a.  Soil preservation and final grading. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued until final grading has been completed and the lot precovered with soil with an average depth of at least six inches which shall contain no particles more than two inches in diameter over the entire area of the lot, except that portion covered by buildings or included in streets, or where the grade has not been changed or natural vegetation seriously damaged. Topsoil shall not be removed from residential lots or used as spoil, but shall be redistributed so as to provide as least six inches of cover on the lots and at least four inches of cover between the sidewalks and curbs, and shall be stabilized by seeding or planting. 
b.  Lot drainage. Lots shall be laid out so as to provide positive drainage away from all buildings, and individual lot drainage shall be coordinated with the general storm drainage pattern for the area. Drainage shall be designed so as to avoid concentration of storm drainage water from each lot to adjacent lots. 
c.  Lawn-grass seed and sod. Sod or any approved grass seed may be used to comply with any requirements of seeding set forth herein. Lawn-grass seed shall be sown at not less than four pounds to each 1,000 square feet of land area. In the spring the seed shall be sown between March 15 and May 15; and in the fall the seed shall be sown between August 15 and September 30. All seed shall have been tested for germination within one year of the date of seeding, and the date of testing shall be on the label containing the seed analysis. All lots all be seeded from the roadside edge of the unpaved right-of-way back to a distance of 25 feet behind the principal residence on the lot except for any portion left in an unaltered state. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued until re-spreading of soil and seeding of lawn has been completed; except that between October 1 and March 15, and between May 15 and August 15, the applicant shall submit an agreement in writing signed by the developer and the property owner, with a copy to the building inspector, that re-spreading of soil and seeding of lawn will be done during the immediate following planting season as set for in the ordinance, and leave a cash escrow for performance in an amount determined by the building inspector. 
7.  Debris and waste. No cut trees, timber, debris, earth, rocks, stones, soil, junk, rubbish, or other waste materials of any kind shall be buried in any land, or left or deposited on any lot or street at the time of the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, and removal of those items and materials shall be required prior to issuance of any certificate of occupancy on a subdivision. No items and materials as described in the preceding sentence shall be left or deposited in any area of the subdivision at the time of expiration of any subdivision improvement agreement or dedication of public improvements, whichever is sooner. 
8.  Waterbodies and watercourses. If a tract being subdivided contains a water body, or portion thereof, lot lines shall be so drawn as to distribute the entire ownership of the water body among the fees of adjacent lots. The mayor and council may approve an alternative plan whereby the ownership of and responsibility for safe maintenance of the water body is so placed that it will not become a local government responsibility. No more than 25 percent of the minimum area of a lot required under the zoning ordinance may be satisfied by land that is under water. Where a watercourse separates the buildable area of a lot from the street by which it has access, provisions shall be made for installation of a culvert or other structure of design approved by the city engineer/consultant. 
9.  Subdivision improvement agreement and security to include lot improvement. The applicant shall enter into a separate subdivision improvement agreement secured by a letter of credit or cash escrow to guarantee completion of all lot improvement requirements including but not limited to, soil preservation, final grading, lot drainage, lawn, grass seeding, removal of debris and waste, fencing, and all other lot improvements required by the mayor and council. Whether or not a certificate of occupancy has been issued, the city may enforce the provision of the subdivision improvement agreement where the provisions of this section or any other applicable law, ordinance, or regulation have not been met. 
(Ord. No. 2017-13, Exh. A, 6-20-2017) 
Sec. 4.3. - Roads. 
1.  General requirements. 
a.  Frontage on improved roads. No subdivision shall be approved unless the area to be subdivided shall have frontage on and access from an existing street on the official map, unless such street is: 
i.  An existing state, county, or city highway; or 
ii.  A street shown upon a plat approved by the mayor and council and recorded in the office of the clerk of the superior court. Such street or highway must be suitably improved as required by the highway rules, regulations, specifications, or orders, or be secured by a performance bond required under this ordinance, with the width and right-of-way required by ordinance or the official map plan. 
Where the area to be subdivided is to utilize existing road frontage, the road shall be suitably improved as provided above. 
b.  Grading and improvement plan. Roads shall be graded and improved and conform to the local government construction standards and specifications and shall be approved as to design and specifications by the city engineer/consultant, in accordance with the construction plans required to be submitted prior to final plat approval. 
c.  Classifications. All roads shall be classified as arterial, collector, subcollector, or access. In classifying roads, the city shall consider projected traffic demands after 20 years of development. 
d.  Topography and arrangement. 
i.  Roads shall be related appropriately to the topography. Local roads shall be curved wherever possible to avoid conformity of lot appearance. All streets shall be arranged so as to obtain as many building sites as possible at, or above, the grades to the streets. Grades of streets shall conform as closely as possible to the original topography. A combination of steep grades and curves shall be avoided. Specific standards are contained in the design standards of this ordinance. 
ii.  All streets shall be properly integrated with the existing and proposed system of thoroughfares and dedicated rights-of-way as established on the official map and/or comprehensive plan. 
iii.  All thoroughfares shall be properly related to special traffic generators such as industries, business districts, schools, churches, and shopping centers; to population densities; and to the pattern of existing and proposed land uses. 
iv.  Minor or local streets shall be laid out to conform as much as possible to the topography to discourage use by through-traffic, to permit efficient drainage and utility systems, and to require the minimum number of streets necessary to provide convenient and safe access to property. 
v.  The rigid rectangular gridiron street pattern need not necessarily be adhered to, and the use of curvilinear streets, culs-de-sac or U-shaped streets shall be encouraged where such use will result in a more desirable layout. 
vi.  Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the tract to be subdivided, unless prevented by topography or other physical conditions, or unless in the opinion of the mayor and council such extension is not necessary or desirable for the coordination of the layout of the subdivision with the existing layout or the most advantageous future development of adjacent tracks. 
vii.  In business and industrial developments, the streets and their access ways shall be planned in connection with the grouping of buildings, location of rail facilities, and the provision of alleys, truck loading and maneuvering areas, and walks and parking areas so as to minimize conflict of movement between the various types of traffic, including pedestrian. 
e.  Blocks. 
i.  Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two tiers of lots of appropriate depths. Exceptions to this prescribed block width shall be permitted in blocks adjacent to major streets, railroads, or waterways. 
ii.  The lengths, widths, and shapes of blocks shall be such as are appropriate for the locality and the type of development contemplated, but block lengths in residential areas shall not exceed 2,200 feet or 12 times the minimum lot width required in the zoning district, nor be less than 400 feet in length. Wherever practicable, blocks along major arterials and collector streets shall be not less than 1,000 feet in length. 
iii.  In long blocks the mayor and council may require the reservation of an easement through the block to accommodate utilities, drainage facilities, or pedestrian traffic. 
iv.  Pedestrian ways or crosswalks, not less than ten feet wide, may be required by the mayor and council through the center of blocks more than 800 feet long where deemed essential to provide circulation or access to schools, playgrounds, shopping centers, transportation, or other community facilities. Blocks designed for industrial uses shall be of such length and width as may be determined suitable by the mayor and council for prospective use. 
f.  Access to primary arterials. Where a subdivision borders on or contains an existing or proposed primary arterial, the mayor and council may require that access to such streets be limited by one of the following means: 
i.  The subdivision of lots so as to back onto the primary arterial and front onto a parallel local street; no access shall be provided from the primary arterial, and screening shall be provided in a strip of land along the rear property line of such lots. 
ii.  A series of culs-de-sac, U-shaped streets, or short loops entered from and designed generally at right angles to such a parallel streets, with the rear lines of their terminal lots backing onto the primary arterial. 
iii.  A marginal access or service road (separated from the primary arterial by a planning or grass strip and having access at suitable points). 
g.  Road names. The sketch plat as submitted shall indicate any names for proposed streets. The city clerk may consult the local postmaster prior to the mayor and council determination. Names shall be sufficiently different in sound and spelling from other road names in the city so as not to cause confusion. A road, which is, or is planned as a continuation of an existing road, shall bear the same name. 
h.  Road regulatory signs. The applicant shall deposit with the city at the time of final subdivision approval the sum of $50.00 for each road sign required by the city manager at all road intersections. The city shall install all road signs before issuance of certificates of occupancy for any residence on the streets approved. Street name signs are to be placed at all intersections within or abutting the subdivision, the type and location of which to be approved by the city manager. 
i.  Reserve strips. The creation of reserve strips shall not be permitted adjacent to a proposed street in such a manner as to deny access from adjacent property to the street. 
j.  Construction of roads and dead-end roads. 
i.  Construction of roads. The arrangement of streets shall provide for the continuation of principal streets between adjacent properties when the continuation is necessary for convenient movement of traffic, effective fire protection, for efficient provision of utilities, and where the continuation is in accordance with the city's traffic plan. If the adjacent property is undeveloped and the street must temporarily be a dead-end street, the right-of-way shall be extended to the property line. A temporary T-or L-shaped turnabout shall be provided on all temporary dead-end streets, with the notation on the subdivision plat that land outside the normal street right-of-way shall revert to abuttors whenever the street is continued. The mayor and council may limit the length of temporary dead-end streets in accordance with the design standards of this ordinance. 
ii.  Dead-end roads (permanent). Where a road does not extend beyond the boundary of the subdivision and its continuation is not required by the mayor and council for access to adjoining property, its terminus shall normally not be nearer to such boundary than 50 feet. However, the mayor and council may require the reservation of an appropriate easement to accommodate drainage facilities, pedestrian traffic, or utilities. A cul-de-sac turnaround shall be provided at the end of a permanent dead-end street in accordance with city construction standards and specifications. For greater convenience to traffic and more effective police and fire protection, permanent dead-end streets shall, in general, be limited in length in accordance with the design standards of this ordinance. 
k.  Substandard roads/streets. In the event that a development has access to a substandard street (i.e. is dirt or gravel road), the following improvements shall be required: 
i.  Improvements to primary access roads. If a development has road frontage on a substandard street, the street shall be paved from the end of the existing pavement to the primary access point into the subject development. Said improvements shall meet the specifications required in subsection k.ii. below and be at developer's expense. 
ii.  Specifications. Offsite improvements required under subsection k.i. above shall, at a minimum, result in full section roadway meeting a standard of 20 feet edge of pavement, with drainage swale ditches as needed. Responsibilities shall be as follows. 
a)  The developer shall design the road and provide the labor, equipment, and materials required for roadway improvements and necessary drainage improvements. 
b)  If the city desires the roadway to be improved to a standard greater than that as specified herein, the city shall provide or pay the cost of the additional materials and labor. 
c)  All rights-of-way required for these off-site improvements shall be acquired by the city at the expense of the developer. 
d)  The use of "California" or "rollback curve" shall be forbidden. 
2.  Design standards. 
a.  General. In order to provide for roads of suitable location, width, and improvement to accommodate prospective traffic and afford satisfactory access to police, firefighting. sanitation, and road- maintenance equipment, and to coordinate roads so as to compose a convenient system and avoid undue hardships to adjoining properties, the following design standards for roads are hereby required and shall be planned for and provided by the subdivider, prior to the approval of the final plat. Road classifications may be indicated in the comprehensive plan; otherwise, they shall be determined by the mayor and council. 
b.  Rights-of-way. 
i.  Minimum street rights-of-way. Minimum street right-of-way width, if curb and gutter is provided, shall be as follows: 
Arterial ..... 100 feet 
Collector ..... 64 feet 
Subcollector ..... 64 feet 
Access: 
Residential ..... 50 feet 
Commercial ..... 50 feet 
Industrial ..... 70 feet 
Lane ..... 60 feet 
Alley ..... 24 feet 
If curb and gutter is not provided, minimum street right-of-way width must be increased to a minimum of 60 feet. 
ii.  Additional right-of-way. Right-of-way widths in excess of the standards, designated in this ordinance shall be required whenever, due to topography, additional width is necessary to provide adequate cut slopes. Such slopes shall not be in excess of two-to-one. 
c.  Street pavement widths. Street pavement widths shall be as follows: 
Arterial ..... 26 feet 
Collector ..... 26 feet 
Subcollector ..... 24 feet 
Access: 
Residential ..... 20 feet 
Commercial ..... 20 feet 
Industrial ..... 30 feet 
Lane ..... 20 feet 
Alley: 
Residential ..... 18 feet 
Commercial ..... 20 feet 
If pavement width exceeds 20 feet, then right-of-way width must be increased proportionally. Cul-de sac turn around right-of way radius shall be outside of pavement radius plus 15 feet with curb and gutter and 20 feet without curb and gutter. 
d.  Paving requirements. 
i.  Clearing and grubbing right-of-way. This work shall consist of removing and disposing of all vegetation and debris within five feet of the pavement edge to a depth of at least three feet below finished subgrade. All stump holes shall be back filled below finished subgrade. All stump holes shall be back filled with a suitable material, Class I or II soil. 
ii.  Subgrade. This work shall consists of placing, mixing, compacting and shaping the top six inches of soil. This work also includes subgrade stabilization. 
iii.  Compaction. The entire surface shall be plowed, harrowed and mixed to a depth of at least six inches. After the material has been thoroughly mixed, the subgrade shall be compacted at 95 percent standard proctor of maximum density. Sheepfoot rollers are required. Compaction test shall be at 500 feet intervals and at every two feet of fill material. Any areas that do not meet with the specified compaction shall be excavated and replaced with suitable material. Test results shall be submitted to the city manager as conducted. All costs for compaction tests shall be incurred by the developer. 
iv.  Subgrade material. The material shall consist of Class I or II soil. If such material is not available on site, it shall be furnished by the developer. 
v.  Base. All residential streets shall have a six-inch graded aggregate base or a four-inch compacted asphaltic concrete base, if approved by city engineering. 
vi.  Paving. All residential streets shall have one and one-half inch binder and a one inch Plant Mix asphalt Type "E" or "F" top weaving surface applied to a properly prepared base. 
vii.  Curb and gutter. A curb and gutter section is required on all residential streets. 
e.  Shoulder requirements. The street right-of-way shall be graded 12 feet or if sidewalks are installed then one foot behind the outer edge of the sidewalk, measured from the back of curb or edge of pavement on both sides of the street. Utilities and water lines shall not be installed between curve and outside of drainage ditch, to prevent the encroachment of driveways into the street surface, and to provide walk-ways off the paved vehicular surface; provided, however, the mayor and council may waive this requirement in cases where the subdivider can demonstrate that the topography of the land being subdivided is such that compliance with this provision would be impractical. Topsoil, striped and stock piled before paving, shall be spread at a minimum depth of four inches in preparation of the seedbed. The soil shall be thoroughly broken, well pulverized, smoothed and firm before planting. Shoulder shall be seeded with Bermuda applied at a rate of two pounds per 1,000 square feet or fescue applied at a rate of five pounds per 1,000 square feet. Mulch shall be used on all seeded areas. 
f.  Culverts. Pipe size shall be determined by standard engineering practices. All pipes shall be bituminous coated. A flared-end-section shall be attached to all pipe openings. 
g.  Railroads and limited access highways. Railroad rights-of-way and limned access highways where so located as to affect the subdivision of adjoining lands shall be treated as follows: 
i.  In residential districts a buffer strip at least 25 feet in depth in addition to the normal depth of the lot required in the district shall be provided adjacent to the railroad right-of-way or limited access highway. This strip shall be part of the platted lots and shall be designated on the plat: "This strip is reserved for screening. The placement of structures on this land is prohibited." 
ii.  In districts zoned for business, commercial, or industrial uses the nearest street extending parallel or approximately parallel to the railroad right-of-way shall wherever practicable, be at a sufficient distance from the railroad right-of-way to ensure suitable depth for commercial or industrial sites. 
iii.  When streets parallel to the railroad right-of-way intersect a street which crosses the railroad right-of-way at grade, they shall, to the extent practicable, be at a distance of a least 150 feet from the railroad right-of-way. Such distance shall be determined with due consideration of the minimum distance required for future separation of grades by means of appropriate approach gradient. 
h.  Intersections. 
i.  Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles. A proposed intersection of two new streets at an angle of less than 75 degrees shall not be acceptable. An oblique street should be curved approaching an intersection and should be approximately at right angles for at least 100 feet therefrom. Not more than two streets shall intersect at any one point unless specifically approved by the mayor and council. 
ii.  Proposed new intersections along one side of an existing street shall, wherever practicable, coincide with any existing intersections on the opposite side of such street. Street jogs with center-line offsets of less than 150 feet shall not be permitted, except where the intersected street has separated dual drives without median breaks at either intersection. Where streets intersect arterials, their alignments shall be continuous. Intersection of arterials shall be at least 800 feet apart. All other street intersections must be separated from each other by at least 125 feet. 
iii.  Minimum curb radius at the intersection of two local streets shall be at least 20 feet; and minimum curb radius at an intersection involving a collector street shall be at least 25 feet and 30 feet maximum of alley intersections and abrupt changes in alignment within a block shall have the corners cut off in accordance with standard engineering practice to permit safe vehicular movement. 
iv.  Intersections shall be designed with a flat grade wherever practical. In hilly or rolling areas, at the approach to an intersection, a leveling area shall be provided having not greater than a two percent rate at a distance of 60 feet, measured from the nearest right-of-way line of the intersecting street. 
v.  Where any street intersection will involve earth banks or existing vegetation, inside any lot corner that would create a traffic hazard by limiting visibility, the developer shall cut such ground and/or vegetation (including trees) in connection with the grading of the public right-of-way to the extent deemed necessary to provide an adequate sight distance. 
vi.  The cross-slopes on all streets, including intersections, shall be three percent or less. 
i.  Linear street grades. Maximum and minimum linear street grades shall be as follows: 
Arterial street—Not more than six percent. 
Collector street—Not more than eight percent. 
Subcollector street, access streets, and alleys—Not more than ten percent. 
No linear street grade shall be less than two percent. 
j.  Horizontal curvature. The radii of center line road curvature shall be as follows: 
Arterial ..... 300 feet 
Collector ..... 200 feet 
Subcollector ..... 200 feet 
Access ..... 100 feet 
Lane ..... 100 feet 
Alley: To be determined by M&C 
k.  Vertical alignment. There shall be horizontal sight distance at all street intersections, when measured from a height of six feet according to the following: 
Arterial ..... 400 feet 
Collector ..... 300 feet 
Subcollector ..... 200 feet 
Access ..... 150 feet 
Lane ..... 200 feet 
Alley ..... 150 feet 
Where two or more streets of different classifications intersect, the sight distance requirement for the highest classification shall be used. 
l.  Culs-de-sac. The length of all culs-de-sac shall not exceed 12 times the minimum required lot width or 1,200 feet, whichever is less. Large culs-de-sac may be approved by the mayor and council if topographic conditions pose development constraints or unusual platting exists. Such approvals must be with the consent of the fire marshal. For a residential subdivision, the minimum radius for the paved area of a circular turnaround is 50 feet. An off-center turnaround is preferred as it creates visual variety and improves turning ease for the driver. For a non-residential subdivision, the minimum radius for the paved area of a circular turnaround is 50 feet. 
m.  Private access drives. Private access drives shall be permitted to serve no more than two land-locked residential lots where, due to special problems created as a result of necessary unusual platting configuration, or as a result of special physical features, the property could not otherwise be developed. No more than one such drive shall be approved per subdivision development and must be approved as part of the sketch plat. Private access drives shall have the same right-of-way as is required for local streets. 
n.  Alleys. Alleys serving residential lots or dwellings may be required for loading at the rear of all lots designated for business and industrial use. Dead-end alleys are prohibited. 
o.  Slope maintenance easement. A slope maintenance easement shall be required whenever, due to topography, additional width is necessary to provide adequate earth slopes. 
p.  Primary highway system. Whenever a proposed subdivision abuts an arterial road or major collector, an access road or lane with curbing extending the full length of the subdivision along such highway and providing limited access thereto may be required at a distance suitable for the use of the land between such access road or lane highway. 
q.  Visibility. Where any street intersection will involve earth banks or existing vegetation inside any lot corner that would create a traffic hazard by limiting visibility, the developer shall cut such ground or vegetation in connection with the grading of the public right-of-way to the extent deemed necessary to comply with the sight distance required of these regulations. 
r.  Driveways. Driveways shall have a slope of not more than a positive or negative 12 percent for a distance of ten feet measured along the driveway center line from the right-of-way line, and must be a minimum of six inches above the elevation of the gutter line. 
s.  Sidewalks. The inclusion of sidewalks within major subdivisions is required. Sidewalks shall be on both sides of the road and within the dedicated non-paved right-of-way of all roads within the subdivision. Concrete curbs are required for all roads where sidewalks are to be installed. The minimum paved width of sidewalks shall be four feet and a median strip of grasses or landscaped areas at least two feet wide shall separate all sidewalks from adjacent curbs unless the mayor and council make an exception. 
3.  Slopes. 
a.  General requirements. Development of subdivisions is to be accomplished with minimal earth moving and disruption to the natural topography of the site. It is the intent of this ordinance that existing or man-made slopes be modified or designed in such a way as to minimize potential for erosion and to minimize ease of maintenance. Subdivision development shall conform to provisions of the city's erosion and sediment control ordinance and Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia. 
b.  Design standards. 
i.  No existing or proposed cut or fill slope shall exceed three horizontal units to one vertical unit within 14 feet of the edge of pavement of back of curb. If the distance is greater than 14 feet, the slope may be greater than three-to-one (3:1) up to a maximum to one vertical unit, provided that all cut and fill shall be within the prescribed right-of-way of the road or slope easements. All grading as provided within this section shall be completed and approved by the city engineer/consultant prior to the installation of any utilities. 
ii.  All fill slopes created for the purpose of street construction shall have a compaction of not less than 95 percent as determined by established engineering practices. 
iii.  Slopes flatter than those set forth in the foregoing paragraphs may be required when, in the opinion of the city engineer/consultant, the general nature of the soil involved warrants a flatter slope. To control surface drainage on existing and proposed slopes, berm ditches may be required at the top and the intersection of the slope and ground line. 
iv.  All slopes created or existing within the subdivision or as a result of the subdivision development shall be planted or otherwise protected from erosion and failure. Such planting and other protection from erosion and failure shall be completed and shall be undertaken immediately upon creation of any slope steeper than two horizontal feet to one vertical foot and completed without delay in accordance with plans and specifications approved by the city engineer/consultant. In addition, the subdivider may be required to provide a fence, hedge, guardrail or other protective device, specified by the city engineer/consultant along ridges in excess of 20 vertical feet in height and with slopes in excess of 1.5:1 (horizontal:vertical) to prevent dangerous falls for children and other residents of the subdivision. At the option of the city engineer/consultant, the developer shall provide certified test results of compaction and any material provided at the location and frequency determined necessary by the city engineer/consultant. 
(Ord. No. 2017-13, Exh. A, 6-20-2017) 
Sec. 4.4. - Drainage and storm sewers. 
1.  Drainage. 
a.  General requirements. The storm water drainage system and easements shall be separate and independent of any sanitary sewer system and easement. The mayor and council shall not recommend for approval any plat of a subdivision which does not make adequate provision for storm or flood water runoff channels or basins. Storm water runoff and storm sewer or channel design shall be designed by a method as approved by the city engineer/consultant, and a copy of design computations shall be submitted along with the construction plans. Inlets shall be provided so that surface water is not carried for a distance of more than 600 feet in the gutter. When calculations indicate that curb capacities are exceeded at a point, no further allowance shall be made for flow at that point. Natural drainage channels existing within a subdivision shall be improved by the subdivider to specifications approved by the city engineer/consultant (if erosion, flooding, or hazard will be created by the continued existence thereof, as determined by the city engineer/consultant). 
b.  Nature of storm water facilities. 
i.  Location. The applicant may be required by the city engineer/consultant to carry away by pipe or open ditch any spring or surface water that may exist either previously to, or as a result of the subdivision. Such drainage facilities shall be located in the road right-of-way where feasible, or in perpetual unobstructed easements of appropriate width, and shall be constructed in accordance with the requirements of the city engineer/consultant. 
ii.  Accessibility to public storm sewers. When a public storm sewer is accessible, the applicant shall install storm sewer facilities, or if no outlets are within a reasonable distance, adequate provisions shall be made for the disposal of storm water, subject to the specifications of the city engineer/consultant. If a connection to a public storm sewer will be provided eventually, as determined by the city engineer/consultant, the developer shall make arrangements for further storm water disposal by a public utility system at the time the final plat receives final approval. 
iii.  Accommodation of upstream drainage areas. A culvert or other drainage facility shall in each case be large enough to accommodate potential runoff from its entire upstream drainage area whether inside or outside the subdivision. The city engineer/consultant shall approve the necessary size of the facility which has been designed by a registered professional engineer, based on 110 percent of the current storm runoff for the 100-year storm for culverts under streets, and the 25-year storm for all other culverts. Minimum pipe size shall be 18 inches. 
iv.  Effect of downstream drainage areas. The developer shall study and the city engineer/consultant shall review and approve the effect of each subdivision on existing downstream drainage facilities outside the area of the subdivision. Drainage studies, together with such other studies as shall be appropriate shall serve as a guide to needed improvements. Where it is anticipated that the additional runoff incident to the development of the subdivision will overload an existing downstream drainage facility, the mayor and council shall withhold approval of the subdivision until provision has been made for other improvement of said condition. No subdivision shall be approved unless adequate drainage is provided to an adequate watercourse or facility. 
v.  Dedication of drainage easements. 
(a)  General requirements. Where a subdivision is transversed by a watercourse, drainage way, channel, or stream, there shall be provided a storm water easement or drainage right-of-way conforming substantially to the lines of such watercourse, and of such width and construction or both as will be adequate for the purpose. Whenever possible, it is desirable that drainage be maintained by appropriate means of adequate width for maximum potential volume or flow. 
(b)  Drainage easement. Where topography or other conditions are such as to make impractical the inclusion of drainage facilities within road right-of-way, perpetual unobstructed easements at least 20 feet in width for such drainage facilities shall be provided across to the road. Easement shall be indicated on the plat. Drainage easements shall be carried from the road to a natural watercourse or to other drainage facilities. Easements less than 20 feet may be approved by the city engineer/consultant. When a proposed drainage system will carry water across private land outside this subdivision and outside a natural drain, appropriate drainage rights must be secured and indicated on the plat. The applicant shall dedicate, either in fee sample or by drainage easement, land on both sides of existing watercourses, for a distance to be determined by the city engineer/consultant. Low-lying land along watercourses suspect to flooding or overflowing during storm periods, whether or not included in areas for dedication, shall be preserved and retained in their natural state as drainage ways. Final plats for all subdivisions shall show (or include by note) a ten-foot wide drainage easement along every property line whether the developer intends to channel water in these easements or not. 
(Ord. No. 2017-13, Exh. A, 6-20-2017) 
Sec. 4.5. - Water facilities. 
1.  General requirements. 
a.  Necessary action shall be taken by the applicant to extend or create a water-supply district for the purpose of providing domestic water use and fire protection.
