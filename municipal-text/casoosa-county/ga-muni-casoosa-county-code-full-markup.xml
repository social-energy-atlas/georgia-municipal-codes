         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE                   This Code constitutes a complete codification of the general and permanent ordinances and resolutions of Catoosa County, Georgia. 
                  Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances and resolutions adopted by the board of commissioners. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any ordinance and resolution included herein. 
                  The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
                  This 2012 republication includes all amendatory legislation through Ord. No. 11-002, adopted October 18, 2011, and was accomplished under the supervision of Mary Summers, Editor. 
                  Chapter and Section Numbering System 
                  The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
                  Page Numbering System 
                  The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

                   
                  Indexes 
                  The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
                  Looseleaf Supplements 
                  A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
                  Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
                  Acknowledgments 
                  This publication was under the direct supervision of Ron K. McLaughlin, Supervising Editor, and John W. Welch, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
                  The publisher is most grateful to Clifton M. Patty, Jr., County Attorney, and Freida B. Redman, County Clerk, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the county readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the county's affairs.

                  ADOPTING ORDINANCE 
                  ORDINANCE OF 8-4-98 
                  An Ordinance Adopting and Enacting a New Code for Catoosa County, Georgia; Providing for the Repeal of Certain Ordinances Not Included Therein; Providing a Penalty for the Violation Thereof; Providing for the Manner of Amending Such Code; and Providing When Such Code and This Ordinance Shall Become Effective. 
                  Be it Ordained by the Board of Commissioners of Catoosa County, Georgia: 
                  Section 1. The Code entitled "Official Code of Catoosa County, Georgia," published by Municipal Code Corporation, consisting of Chapters 1 through 74, each inclusive, is adopted. 
                  Section 2. All ordinances of a general and permanent nature enacted on or before April 15, 1997, and not included in the Code or recognized and continued in force by reference therein, are repealed. 
                  Section 3. The repeal provided for in Section 2 hereof shall not be construed to revive any ordinance or part thereof that has been repealed by a subsequent ordinance that is repealed by this ordinance. 
                  Section 4. Unless another penalty is expressly provided, every person convicted of a violation of any provision of the Code or any ordinance, resolution, rule or regulation adopted or issued in pursuance thereof shall be punished by a fine not exceeding $1,000.00, or by imprisonment not exceeding 180 days, or by both such fine and imprisonment. Each act of violation and each day upon which any such violation shall occur shall constitute a separate offense. The penalty provided by this section, unless another penalty is expressly provided, shall apply to the amendment of any Code section, whether or not such penalty is reenacted in the amendatory ordinance. In addition to the penalty prescribed above, the county may pursue other remedies such as abatement of nuisances, injunctive relief and revocation of licenses or permits. 
                  Section 5. Additions or amendments to the Code when passed in the form as to indicate the intention of the Board of Commissioners to make the same a part of the Code shall be deemed to be incorporated in the Code, so that reference to the Code includes the additions and amendments. 
                  Section 6. Ordinances adopted after April 15, 1997, that amend or refer to ordinances that have been codified in the Code shall be construed as if they amend or refer to like provisions of the Code. 
                  Section 7. This ordinance shall become effective August 4, 1998. 
                  Passed and Adopted by the Catoosa County Board of Commissioners this 4th day of August, 1998. 
                  CATOOSA COUNTY BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 




                  SUPPLEMENT HISTORY TABLE 
                  The table below allows users of this Code to quickly and accurately determine what ordinances have been considered for codification in each supplement. Ordinances that are of a general and permanent nature are codified in the Code and are considered "Included." Ordinances that are not of a general and permanent nature are not codified in the Code and are considered "Omitted." 
                  In addition, by adding to this table with each supplement, users of this Code will be able to gain a more complete picture of the Code's historical evolution.

               G.  Compensation. The members of the Authority shall receive no compensation for their services of the Authority.

               I.  Funds. The governing authority of Catoosa County is also authorized in addition to the tax provided in Paragraph H, to appropriate to the Authority such amount from its funds each year as it shall see fit, and any funds so appropriated when paid to the Authority shall become a part of the funds of the Authority and may be used for the purposes as herein stated or as may hereafter be defined by law. 
               J.  Debts.

               L.  Bonds.

                  (2)  Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles. 
                  (3)  Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the Code and, where necessary to accommodate new material, change existing section or other subdivision numbers. 
                  (4)  Change the words "this resolution" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case may be, or to "sections ____________ to ____________ " (inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code that embody the substantive sections of the resolution or ordinance incorporated into the Code). 
                  (5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meanings of resolution or ordinance sections inserted into the Code; but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of resolution material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code. 
                  Sec. 1-18. - Altering Code.

                  Sec. 2-128. - Members of boards to attend meetings. 
                  The board of commissioners of the county desires to establish an attendance policy for individuals appointed to serve on the various boards of the county government who are paid county funds for their service on the boards to which they are appointed. The members appointed to the boards provide vital service to the county and their attendance of the meetings of the boards is essential to the proper functioning of the boards. Further, the board members are paid county funds and the board of commissioners desires to limit the pay for service on the boards if a member fails to attend the meetings of the boards. 
                  (1)  Application: This section shall only apply to those members of boards appointed by the governing authority of the county who receive county funds for their service on the boards. 
                  (2)  Attendance policy: Attendance at all meetings of the board to which the member is appointed should be the aspiration of each member of the board. The board of commissioners finds that attendance of meetings of the board is essential to fulfill the purpose of the boards. The purpose of this resolution is to encourage each board member to attend all meetings of the board. 
                  (3)  Attendance required for pay: Any member of a board, commission or authority paid from county funds shall be required to attend the meetings of the board or authority in order to receive compensation for the month of service. If a member of a board is attending school or education courses required in connection with the member's board service, the absence of the member shall not be counted in determining the compensation to be paid. The board member's pay shall be reduced pro rata for any meeting missed by the board member during the month for which the service is required. 
                  (4)  Eligibility for compensation: In order to be eligible for compensation the secretary or clerk of each board or authority shall certify to the clerk designated by the county financial officer that member has attended the meetings of the board during the preceding month. The report of the secretary or clerk of the board shall state the number of meetings during the preceding month for which the pay is being calculated and the attendance by member name of all board attendees at each meeting. 
                  (5)  Calculation of compensation: The amount of pay shall be determined as follows: The monthly compensation shall be reduced in proportion to the total number of meetings per month over the meetings attended by each member of the board. 
                  (6)  Effective date: This section shall be effective December 1, 2001. 
                  (7)  Repealer: All resolutions in conflict with this resolution are repealed but only to the extent of conflict.

                  Editor's note— A resolution adopted Dec. 4, 2001, did not specifically amend the Code. Hence, its inclusion herein as § 2-128 was at the discretion of the editor. 
                  Sec. 2-129. - County to provide liability insurance and to pay the deductible for individuals appointed to serve on various boards of the county government and volunteers. 
                  The board of commissioners of the county from time to time appoints members to serve as directors and members of various boards of authorities, commissions, and committees. These appointees provide substantial and valuable services to the citizens of the county and enhance the effectiveness of local government. The county also maintains a network of volunteers who provide invaluable services to the citizens of the county with no pay saving the taxpayers of the county thousands of dollars. Service on these boards, authorities, and committees by the members, as well as volunteers, is compensated by nominal pay and in many incidences no pay. The board of commissioners desires to provide liability insurance coverage so that the individuals who provide these valuable services for the citizens of the county will have insurance available if they are sued for acts or omission performed in or failed to be performed in the course and scope of their official duties or for acts or omissions performed or failed to be performed in the scope and course of their work for the county. The board also desires to establish, as policy, that the deductible on the liability insurance policies will be paid from county funds. 
                  (1)  Application: This resolution shall apply to the individuals who are directors or members of boards or commissions appointed by the governing authority of the county, the individual members of the committees appointed by the governing authority of the county and individual volunteers who perform labor or services normally provided by local government or who provide labor or services for projects undertaken by the county. 
                  (2)  Insurance coverage: The county shall provide liability insurance coverage to the individuals identified in subsection (1) under the existing policies of liability insurance providing liability insurance coverage for the board of commissioners, public officials, officers, and employees. The insurance to be provided by this resolution shall be the same insurance policies that now cover public officials, officers, and employees of the county. 
                  (3)  Payment of deductible: The county shall pay any deductible required to be paid under the coverage afforded under the insurance policies described in subsection (2) hereof. 
                  (4)  Scope: It is not the intent of this resolution to provide insurance above and beyond the insurance currently available to county officials, officers, and employees. If the carrier of the liability insurance for the county declines coverage because the act or event giving rise to the claim is not a covered event under the policy, the county shall be under no obligation to provide liability insurance or to pay any deductible under any policy other than the county policies. These cases will be handled on a case-by-case basis by further resolution of the board of commissioners.

For the purposes of this resolution, the terms "immediate relative" and "immediate family member" shall mean a spouse, child, parent, father-in-law, mother-in-law, sibling, brother-in-law or sister-in-law of a commissioner.

                  (15)  Preventing or attempting to prevent competitive bidding .

The oath shall be filed with the county officer whose duty it is to make the payment. If the contractor is a partnership, all of the partners and any officer, agent, or other person who may have represented or acted for them in bidding for or procuring the contract shall also make the oath. If the contractor is a corporation, all officers, agents, or other persons who may have acted for or represented the corporation in bidding for or procuring the contract shall make the oath. If such oath is false, the contract shall be void, and all sums paid by the county on the contract may be recovered by appropriate action.

A finding of special circumstance under this paragraph shall not be based on the possibility or presence of a labor dispute concerning the use of contractors or subcontractors who are nonsignatories to, or otherwise do not adhere to, agreements with one or more labor organizations or concerning employees on the particular project who are not members of or affiliated with a labor organization. 
                  (17)  Officer, official or employee of county prohibited from profit or pay on contract .

                  c.  In the case of competitive sealed proposals, the county shall advise offerors in the request for proposals of the number of days that offerors will be required to honor their proposals; provided, however, that if an offeror is not selected within 60 days of opening the proposals, any offeror that is determined by the county to be unlikely of being selected for contract award shall be released from his or her proposal.

                  DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

                  Sec. 10-31. - Findings; public purpose. 
                  (a)  Based on the experience of other urban counties and municipalities, including, but not limited to, Atlanta and Fulton County, Georgia; DeKalb County, Georgia; Ft. Lauderdale and Palm Beach, Florida; and Chattanooga, Tennessee; and in reliance on studies by the City of Austin, Texas, and the City of Dallas, Texas, which experiences and studies are found by the board of commissioners to be similar to the problems faced by the county and in reliance on the determinations found by various courts of law, federal and state, of the effects of these establishments on the surrounding community and the community as a whole, the board of commissioners takes note of the notorious and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within the county. Moreover, it is the finding of the commission that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly in adult entertainment establishments, begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with public nudity in adult entertainment establishments are disorderly conduct, prostitution, and drug trafficking and use. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with public nudity and adult entertainment establishments are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhood, increased expenditure for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described, and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas. Therefore, the board of commissioners exercises its legislative authority in the limitation of nude conduct in adult entertainment establishments finding regulation is necessary, in the public welfare, and is a matter of governmental interest and concern to prevent the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with adult entertainment establishments. 
                  (b)  The board of commissioners declares that the purpose of this article is to regulate certain types of businesses, including but not limited to adult entertainment establishments, to the end that the many types of criminal activities and undesirable community conditions frequently engendered by such businesses will be curtailed. However, it is recognized that such regulation cannot de facto approach prohibition. The governing authority recognizes that it cannot legislatively abolish protected forms of expression. As to adult dance establishments, this article represents a balancing of competing interests: reduced criminal activity and protection of the neighborhoods through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments and the protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons.

                  ARTICLE IV. - RULES AND REGULATIONS FOR THE USE OF CERTAIN COUNTY BUILDINGS 

                  Sec. 18-101. - Intent. 
                  The county owns several buildings which are under the control and jurisdiction of the board of commissioners of the county. These buildings include the buildings located at the Benton Place Campus, the voting precinct buildings located throughout the county, the Nutrition Center located in the City of Ringgold, Constitution Hall located in Fort Oglethorpe, and gymnasiums which are attached to certain voting precinct buildings. During the time that some of these buildings are not used for a governmental purpose, it has been policy of the board of commissioners to allow private citizens, civic groups, churches, clubs, youth groups, senior citizens, and other associations to use some of the buildings. All of these buildings are maintained with county funds and the board of commissioners believes that they should be utilized to the fullest extent possible consistent with the primary governmental purposes for which the buildings were constructed. The board of commissioners finds that it is in the best interest of the county and the taxpayers of the county that certain user groups pay a fee to help pay for the maintenance of the buildings. The use of certain of the buildings has been dedicated to specific purposes and the management of certain buildings has been delegated to certain non-profit groups or the county has entered into contracts with the department of community affairs and others which restrict the use of some of the buildings. The board desires by this article to provide for a written policy regarding the use of the buildings, the fees which will be charged to use the buildings, the conditions in which the buildings can be used, and rules for the use of the buildings. 
                  (Ord. of 12-18-01(4); Ord. of 9-5-17(1) § 1)

                  Advanced life support ambulance service means that the ambulance, equipment on the ambulance, supplies on the ambulance and personnel manning the ambulance meet the requirements for advanced life support ambulance service as set forth in chapter 290-5-30—.04 of the rules and regulations of the state department of health. 
                  Basic life support ambulance service means that the ambulance, equipment on the ambulance, supplies on the ambulance and personnel manning the ambulance meet the minimum standards set forth in chapter 290-5-30—.04 of the rules and regulations of the state department of health.

If an advanced life support ambulance is not available from the service and the dispatcher dispatches a basic life support ambulance, the dispatcher shall also dispatch an advanced life support ambulance from another service to respond to the emergency call. If a basic life support ambulance and an advanced life support ambulance are both dispatched to a call, the advanced life support ambulance shall transport the patient unless circumstances require that the patient be transported by the first responding unit.

                  Sec. 30-67. - Billing of subscribers; collection of charge; equipment installation. 
                  (a)  A monthly 911 charge as set forth in the schedule of fees and charges on file in the office of the county clerk shall be imposed on each subscriber of an exchange access facility for monthly 911 charges with respect to that facility by the service supplier. All exchange access facilities billed to federal, state or local governments shall be exempt from the 911 charge. Each service supplier shall, on behalf of the county, collect the 911 charge from those telephone subscribers to whom it provides exchange telephone service in the county. As a part of its normal monthly billing process, the service supplier shall collect the 911 charge for each month an access exchange facility is in service, and it shall list the 911 charge as a separate entry on each bill. If a service supplier receives a partial payment for a monthly bill from a telephone subscriber, the service supplier shall apply the payment against the amount the telephone subscriber owes the service supplier first. 
                  (b)  Every telephone subscriber in the county shall be liable for the 911 charge imposed under this article until it has been paid to each service supplier. A service supplier shall have no obligation to take any legal action to enforce the collection of the 911 charge. The service supplier shall provide the governing authority, within 60 days, with the name and address of each subscriber located in the county who has refused to pay the 911 charge after such 911 charge has become due. The county may, in its discretion, initiate a collection action against each subscriber who has refused to pay the 911 charge after such 911 charge has become due. Further, the county shall be authorized to collect all reasonable costs incurred in collecting the 911 charge, including attorney's fees associated with the collection action to collect the 911 charge. 
                  (c)  The county shall remain ultimately responsible to the service supplier for all emergency 911 system installation, service, equipment, operation and maintenance charges owed to the service supplier. Any taxes due on emergency 911 system service provided by the service supplier will be billed to the county. State and local taxes shall not apply to the 911 charge billed to telephone subscribers in accordance with provisions of O.C.G.A. § 46-5-134(c).

                  (a)  Each service supplier that collects 911 charges on behalf of the county is entitled to retain as an administrative fee an amount equal to three percent of the gross 911 charge receipts to be remitted to the county. The remaining amount shall be due quarterly to the county and shall be remitted to the county no later than 60 days after the close of a calendar quarter. Each service supplier shall maintain records of the amount of the 911 charge collected for a period of at least three years from the date of collection. The county may at its expense require an annual audit of the service suppliers' books and records with respect to the collection and remittance of the 911 charge. 
                  (b)  There is established on behalf of the county a separate restricted revenue fund known as the emergency telephone system fund of the county. The county may invest the money in the fund in the same manner that other moneys of the county may be invested, and any income earned from such investment shall be deposited into the emergency telephone system fund of the county. 
                  (c)  Money from the emergency telephone system fund of the county shall be used only as follows: 
                  (1)  The lease, purchase or maintenance of emergency telephone equipment, including necessary computer hardware, software, and database provisioning; addressing; and nonrecurring cost of establishing of a 911 system; 
                  (2)  The rate associated with the services suppliers' 911 service and other suppliers' reoccurring charges; 
                  (3)  The actual cost of salaries of employees hired by the county solely for the operation and maintenance of the emergency 911 system; 
                  (4)  Office supplies of the public safety answering points used directly in providing emergency 911 system services; and 
                  (5)  The cost of leasing or purchasing a building used as a public answering point. 
                  Moneys from the emergency telephone system fund cannot be used for the construction or lease of an emergency 911 system building until the local government has completed its street addressing plan. 
                  (d)  The county may contract with a service supplier for any term negotiated by the service supplier and the county for emergency 911 system and may make payments from the emergency telephone system fund of the county to provide any payments required by the contract.

                  The county shall, by resolution, reaffirm the necessity for the 911 charge beginning with the 13th month following the month in which the emergency 911 system service is first provided in the county and during such month annually thereafter. The monthly 911 charge may be reduced at any time by the board of commissioners by resolution; however, the governing authority shall be required to reduce such monthly 911 charge at any time the projected revenues from 911 charges will cause the unexpended revenues in the emergency telephone system fund of the county at the end of the fiscal year to exceed by one and one-half times the unexpended revenues in such fund at the end of the immediately preceding fiscal year or at any time the unexpended revenues in such fund at the end of the fiscal year. Such reduction in the 911 charge shall be an amount that will avert the accumulation of revenues in such fund at the end of the fiscal year that will exceed by one and one-half times the amount of revenues in the fund at the end of the immediately preceding fiscal year. In order to provide additional funding for the county for emergency 911 system purposes, the county may receive federal, state, municipal or private funds, which shall be expended for the purposes contained in this article.

                  Editor's note— Ord. No. 06-007, adopted May 25, 2006, amended Art. III, which consisted of §§ 66-76—66-81, in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former §§ 66-76—66-81 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from an ordinance adopted Jan. 22, 1991. 

                  Sec. 66-76. - Findings; authority. 
                  The Catoosa County Board of Commissioners finds that litter found throughout Catoosa County often finds its way into the county's streams, rivers and lakes and detracts from the quality of life for the citizens of Catoosa County. Pollutants carried into the county's streams, rivers, and lakes by litter diminish the quality of the county's water and its aquatic resources. The Catoosa County Board of Commissioners deems it necessary to adopt this litter control ordinance in order to provide a prohibition against littering and to provide an enforcement mechanism with penalties for dealing with those found littering. 
                  This article is modeled on the "Georgia Litter Control Law" (O.C.G.A. § 16-7-40 et. seq.) and the adoption of this article is authorized by the provisions of O.C.G.A. § 16-7-48. 
                  (Ord. No. 06-007, § 1, 5-25-06) 
                  Sec. 66-77. - General provisions. 
                  (1)  Purpose and intent. The purpose of this article is to protect the public health, safety, environment, and general welfare of the citizens of Catoosa County, through the regulation and prevention of litter. The objectives of this article are to: 
                  (a)  Provide for uniform prohibition throughout the unincorporated areas of Catoosa County of any and all littering on public or private property; and 
                  (b)  Prevent the desecration of the beauty and quality of life of the citizens of Catoosa County and to prevent harm to the public health, safety, environment, and general welfare of said citizens, including the degradation of water and aquatic resources caused by litter. 
                  (2)  Applicability. This article shall apply to all public and private property located within the unincorporated areas of Catoosa County, Georgia. 
                  (3)  Compatibility with other regulations. This article is not intended to interfere with, abrogate, or annul any other ordinance, rule or regulation, statute, or other provision of law. The requirements of this article should be considered minimum requirements, and where any provision of this article impose restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule or regulation, or other provision of law, whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall be considered to take precedence. 
                  (4)  Severability. If the provisions of any article, section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this article shall be judged invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such order of judgment shall not affect or invalidate the remainder of any article, section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this article.

Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the ordinance and the NPDES General Permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this Section shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of Section 3.02.04.B. and C. of this Section. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this Section and the NPDES General Permit. 
                  B.  Minimum Requirements/BMPs. 
                  1)  Best management practices as set forth in Section 3.02.04.B. and C. of this Section shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the Director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 subsection (b). 
                  2)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local Issuing Authority or of any state general permit issued by the Division pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the Director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a Local Issuing Authority or of any state general permit issued by the Division pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  4)  The Director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the Board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land-disturbing activities occur. 
                  5)  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in Section 3.02.04.C(15), (16) and (17), in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
                  C.  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
                  4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
                  10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in Section 3.02.04.B(2); 
                  15)  Except as provided in paragraph (16) and (17) of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the Director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the Director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or where bulkheads and sea walls are installed to prevent shoreline erosion on Lake Oconee and Lake Sinclair; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to Part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the Director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the Board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The Director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  17)  There is established a 25-foot buffer along coastal marshlands, as measured horizontally from the coastal marshland-upland interface, as determined in accordance with Chapter 5 of Title 12 of this title, the Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1970, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where an alteration within the buffer area has been authorized pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-286, for maintenance of any currently serviceable structure, landscaping, or hardscaping, including bridges, roads, parking lots, golf courses, golf cart paths, retaining walls, bulkheads, and patios; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, where a drainage structure or roadway drainage structure is constructed or maintained; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, on the landward side of any currently serviceable shoreline stabilization structure, or for the maintenance of any manmade stormwater detention basin, golf course pond, or impoundment that is located entirely within the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. For the purposes of this paragraph maintenance shall be defined as actions necessary or appropriate for retaining or restoring a currently serviceable improvement to the specified operable condition to achieve its maximum useful life. Maintenance includes emergency reconstruction of recently damaged parts of a currently serviceable structure so long as it occurs within a reasonable period of time after damage occurs. Maintenance does not include any modification that changes the character, scope or size of the original design and serviceable shall be defined as usable in its current state or with minor maintenance but not so degraded as to essentially require reconstruction. 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to crossings for utility lines that cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer, provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
                  c.  The buffer shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity conducted pursuant to and in compliance with a valid and effective land-disturbing permit issued subsequent to April 22, 2014, and prior to December 31, 2015; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented or any lot for which the preliminary plat has been approved prior to December 31, 2015, if roadways, bridges, or water and sewer lines have been extended to such lot prior to the effective date of this Act and if the requirement to maintain a 25-foot buffer would consume at least 18 percent of the high ground of the platted lot otherwise available for development; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
                  d.  Activities where the area within the buffer is not more than 500 square feet or that have a "Minor Buffer Impact" as defined in 391-3-7-.01(r), provided that the total area of buffer impacts is less than 5,000 square feet are deemed to have an approved buffer variance by rule. Bank stabilization structures are not eligible for coverage under the variance by rule and notification shall be made to the Division at least 14 days prior to the commencement of land-disturbing activities. 
                  D.  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any Local Issuing Authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in Section 3.02.04.B. and C. 
                  E.  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this Section or the terms of the permit. 
                  (Ord. of 11-15-16(1)) 
                  3.02.05   Application/Permit Process
                  A.  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The Local Issuing Authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this Section, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the Local Issuing Authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
                  B.  Application Requirements. 
                  1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of Catoosa County without first obtaining a permit from the Stormwater Management Office to perform such activity and providing a copy of Notice of Intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
                  2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the Stormwater Management Office and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in Section 3.02.05.C. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land-disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of Section 3.02.04.B. and C. will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by five copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
                  3)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to paragraph (5) subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23, provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8 half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the Division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to paragraph (9) or (10) of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17 shall be submitted in full to the Division, regardless of the existence of a Local Issuing Authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  4)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the Local Issuing Authority shall refer the application and plan to the District for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The District shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the District to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the District review shall be forwarded to the Local Issuing Authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the District, and any variances required by Section 3.02.04.C(15), (16) and (17) have been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per Section 3.02.05.B(6), have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the Local Issuing Authority and the District have entered into an agreement which allows the Local Issuing Authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the District. The Local Issuing Authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised Plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the Local Issuing Authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised Plan submittal. 
                  5)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this Section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the Local Issuing Authority may deny the permit application. 
                  6)  The Local Issuing Authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this Section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the Local Issuing Authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the Local Issuing Authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  C.  Plan Requirements. 
                  1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in Section 3.02.04.B. and C., or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" is hereby incorporated by reference into this Section. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and stormwater management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land-disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the Commission and in consultation with the Division and the Stakeholder Advisory Board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
                  2)  Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate Erosion, Sedimentation and Pollution Control Plan Review Checklist established by the Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
                  D.  Permits. 
                  1)  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by the Local Issuing Authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
                  2)  No permit shall be issued by the Local Issuing Authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the District and the Local Issuing Authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this Section, any variances required by Section 3.02.04.C(15), (16) and (17) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per Section 3.02.05.B(6) are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the Local Issuing Authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
                  3)  Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this Section, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
                  4)  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
                  5)  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the Local Issuing Authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this Section. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
                  6)  The LIA may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(f)(1). 
                  (Ord. of 11-15-16(1)) 
                  3.02.06   Inspection and Enforcement
                  A.  The Stormwater Department will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the Local Issuing Authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this Section, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this Section. 
                  B.  The Local Issuing Authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within 12 months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975. 
                  C.  The Stormwater Office shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this Section, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities. 
                  D.  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the Local Issuing Authority, the Commission, the District, or Division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
                  E.  The District or the Commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as Local Issuing Authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). The District or the Commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The District or the Commission shall notify the Division and request investigation by the Division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
                  F.  The Division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as Local Issuing Authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the Division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a Local Issuing Authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within 90 days after notification by the division, the division shall revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a Local Issuing Authority. 
                  (Ord. of 11-15-16(1)) 
                  3.02.07   Penalties and Incentives
                  A.  Failure to Obtain a Permit for Land-Disturbing Activity. If any person commences any land-disturbing activity requiring a land-disturbing permit as prescribed in this Section without first obtaining said permit, the person shall be subject to revocation of his business license, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a business and associated work activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the Local Issuing Authority. 
                  B.  Stop-Work Orders. 
                  1)  For the first and second violations of the provisions of this Section, the Director or the Local Issuing Authority shall issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have five days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within five days, the Director or the Local Issuing Authority shall issue a stop-work order requiring that land-disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided, however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land-disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the Director or the Local Issuing Authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order in lieu of a warning; 
                  2)  For a third and each subsequent violation, the Director or the Local Issuing Authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order; and 
                  3)  All stop-work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred.

                  Editor's note— An ordinance adopted Sept. 19, 2017 amended Sec. 3.02.00, §§ 3.02.01—3.02.08, in effect repealing and replacing said section as set out herein. Former Sec. 3.02.00 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from a resolution adopted April 7, 2015. 

                  3.03.00 - GROUNDWATER RECHARGE AREAS 
                  3.03.01   Purpose
                  A.  In order to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within the county and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be ensured. For this reason, it is necessary to protect the subsurface water resources that the county and surrounding communities rely on as sources of public water. 
                  B.  Groundwater resources are contained within underground reservoirs known as aquifers. These aquifers are zones of rock beneath the earth's surface capable of containing or producing water from a well. They occupy vast regions of the subsurface and are replenished by infiltration of surface water runoff in zones of the surface known as groundwater recharge areas. Groundwater is susceptible to contamination when unrestricted development occurs within significant groundwater recharge areas. It is, therefore, necessary to manage land use within groundwater recharge areas in order to ensure that pollution threats are minimized. 
                  3.03.02   Applicability
                  This Section shall apply to all lands within the Catoosa County that are mapped as significant recharge areas as defined by this UDC. These mapped areas shall also be referred to as the Catoosa County Groundwater Recharge Area Protection District. 
                  3.03.03   Exemptions
                  Any lot of record approved prior to the adoption of this UDC is exempt from the minimum lot size requirements contained in Sections 3.03.04.B. and C. of this UDC. 
                  3.03.04   Protection Criteria

                  B.  New homes served by a septic tank/drain field system shall be on lots having minimum size limitations as follows, based on application of Table MT-1 of the DHR Manual (hereinafter DHR Table MT-1). The minimums set forth in Table MT-1 may be increased further based on consideration of other factors (set forth in sections A—F) of the DHR Manual. 
                  1)  150 percent of the subdivision minimum lot size calculated based on application of DHR Table MT-1 if they are within a high pollution susceptibility area; 
                  2)  125 percent of the subdivision minimum lot size calculated based on application of DHR Table MT-1 if they are within a medium pollution susceptibility area; 
                  3)  110 percent of the subdivision minimum lot size calculated based on application of DHR Table MT-1 if they are within a low pollution susceptibility area. 
                  C.  New mobile home parks served by septic tank/drainfield systems shall have lots or spaces having minimum size limitations as follows, based on application of Table MT-2 of the DHR Manual (hereinafter DHR Table MT-2). The minimums set forth in Table MT-2 may be increased further based on consideration of other factors (set forth in sections A—F) of the DHR Manual. 
                  1)  150 percent of the subdivision minimum lot or space size calculated based on application of DHR Table MT-2 if they are within a high pollution susceptibility area;

                  3)  110 percent of the subdivision minimum lot or space size calculated based on application of DHR Table MT-2 if they are within a low pollution susceptibility area. 
                  D.  New agricultural waste impoundment sites shall be lined if they are within a high pollution susceptibility area; a medium pollution susceptibility area and exceed 15 acre-feet; or a low pollution susceptibility area and exceed 50 acre-feet. As a minimum, the liner shall be constructed of compacted clay having a thickness of one-foot and a vertical hydraulic conductivity of less than 5 × 10 -7 cm/sec or other criteria established by the Natural Resource and Conservation Service. 
                  E.  New above-ground chemical or petroleum storage tanks, having a minimum volume of 660 gallons, shall have secondary containment for 110 percent of the volume of such tanks or 110 percent of the volume of the largest tank in a cluster of tanks. Such tanks used for agricultural purposes are exempt, provided they comply with all federal requirements. 
                  F.  New facilities that handle hazardous materials of the types listed in Section 312 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (excluding underground storage tanks) and in amounts of 10,000 pounds or more on any one day, shall perform their operations on impervious surfaces and in conformance with any applicable federal spill prevention requirements and local fire code requirements. 
                  G.  Permanent stormwater infiltration basins shall not be constructed in areas having high pollution susceptibility.

                  3.04.00 - WETLAND PROTECTION 
                  3.04.01   Purpose
                  A.  The wetlands in the county are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion, and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; and open space and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well-being of many communities within the state. 
                  B.  Nationally, a considerable number of these important natural resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution and other acts. Piecemeal or cumulative losses will, over time, destroy additional wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare. 
                  C.  The purpose of this Section is to promote wetlands protection, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational and aesthetic values. Activities that may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practicable as determined through a permitting process. 
                  3.04.02   Establishment of the Wetlands Protection District
                  A.  The Wetlands Protection District is hereby established which shall correspond to all lands within the jurisdiction of the county that are mapped as wetland areas by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory Maps. 
                  B.  The generalized wetlands map does not represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the county and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this Section does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements. 
                  3.04.03   Protection Criteria
                  No regulated activity will be permitted within the Wetlands Protection District without written permission or a permit from the county. 
                  A.  If the area proposed for development is located within 50 feet of a wetlands protection district boundary, as determined by the Stormwater Management Director using the Generalized Wetlands Map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ("Corps") determination shall be required. 
                  B.  If the Corps determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site, the local permit or permission will not be granted until a Section 404 Permit or letter of permission is issued. 
                  3.04.04   Permitted Uses
                  A.  The following uses shall be allowed as of right within the Wetlands Protection District to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law, including laws of trespass, and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining, or dredging except as provided herein. 
                  1)  Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish and other wildlife, provided it does not affect waters of Georgia or of the Unites States in such a way that would require an individual 404 Permit. 
                  2)  Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding, and canoeing. 
                  3)  Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the Georgia Forestry Commission and as specified in Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. 
                  4)  The cultivation of agricultural crops. Agricultural activities shall be subject to best management practices approved by the Georgia Department of Agriculture. 
                  5)  The pasturing of livestock, provided that riparian wetlands are protected, that soil profiles are not disturbed and that approved agricultural best management practices are followed. 
                  6)  Education, scientific research, and nature trails. 
                  B.  The activities listed under Section 3.04.03.A of this UDC are exempted from Section 404 of the Clean Water Act provided they do not have impacts on a navigable waterway that would necessitate acquisition of an individual 404 permit. However, under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act, a permit may be required in some circumstances. 
                  3.04.05   Prohibited Uses
                  The following uses are not permitted within the Wetlands Protection District.

                  3.05.00 - WATERSHED PROTECTION 
                  3.05.01   Purpose
                  A.  In order to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within the county and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be assured. The ability of natural systems to filter stormwater runoff can be threatened by unrestricted development. Land-disturbing activities associated with development can increase erosion and sedimentation that threatens the storage capacity of reservoirs. In addition, stormwater runoff, particularly from impervious surfaces, can introduce toxins, nutrients and sediment into drinking water supplies, making water treatment more complicated and expensive and rendering waters resources unusable for recreation. Industrial land uses that involve the manufacture, use, transport, and storage of hazardous or toxic waste materials result in the potential risk of contamination of nearby public drinking water supplies. 
                  B.  The purpose of this Section is to establish measures to protect the quality and quantity of the present and future water supply of the county; to minimize the transport of pollutants and sediment to the water supply; and to maintain the yield of the water supply watershed. This Section shall apply to all existing and proposed water supply watersheds within the county. 
                  3.05.02   Establishment of a Water Supply Watershed District
                  A.  The City of Ringgold Water Supply Watershed District is hereby designated and shall comprise the land that drains to the City of Ringgold water supply intake. The boundaries of these overlays are defined by the ridgelines of the respective watersheds and the boundary of a radius of seven miles upstream of the City of Ringgold water supply intake. These overlays shall be further delineated and defined on the Water Supply Watershed Protection District Overlay Map of Catoosa County. 
                  B.  The following water supply watershed districts and reservoirs are hereby defined and the boundaries shall be identified on the Water Supply Watershed Protection District Overlay Map. 
                  1)  The City of Ringgold water supply intake is a small water supply watershed. An intake of the City of Ringgold is located on Chickamauga Creek.

Therefore, the Board of Commissioners, of Catoosa County Georgia, does ordain as follows: 
                  B.  Findings of Fact. 
                  1)  The flood hazard areas of Catoosa County, Georgia are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  2)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
                  C.  Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this Section to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; and 
                  4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; 
                  5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters. 
                  D.  Objectives. The objectives of this Section are: 
                  1)  To protect human life and health; 
                  2)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
                  3)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; 
                  4)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
                  5)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
                  6)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; and 
                  7)  To ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

Any person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in this Section. 
                  12)  All records pertaining to the provisions of this Section shall be maintained in the office of the Director and shall be open for public inspection. 
                  (Ord. of 9-19-17(2)) 
                  3.08.04   Provisions for Flood Hazard Reduction
                  A.  General Standards. In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  1)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure; 
                  2)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage; 
                  3)  New construction or substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
                  4)  Elevated Buildings. All new construction or substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater. 
                  a.  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
                  i.  Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
                  ii.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and 
                  iii.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both direction. 
                  b.  So as not to violate the "lowest floor" criteria of this Section, the unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area; and 
                  c.  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms. 
                  5)  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding; 
                  6)  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces; 
                  7)  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system; 
                  8)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters; 
                  9)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding; and 
                  10)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure, which is not compliant with the provisions of this Section, shall be undertaken only if the non-conformity is not furthered, extended or replaced. 
                  B.  Specific Standards. In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  1)  New Construction and/or Substantial Improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and/or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than two and seven-tenths feet above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of Section 3.08.04.A(4), "Elevated Buildings". 
                  a.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above two and seven-tenths feet above the base flood elevation. 
                  2)  Non-Residential Construction. New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH zones, may be flood-proofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to two feet above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in Section 3.08.03.C(6). 
                  3)  Standards for Manufactured Homes and Recreational Vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
                  a.  All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on: 
                  i.  Individual lots or parcels, 
                  ii.  In new and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, 
                  iii.  In expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or 
                  iv.  On a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than two and seven-tenths feet above the base flood elevation. 
                  b.  Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
                  i.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than two and seven-tenths feet above the level of the base flood elevation, or 
                  ii.  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
                  c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (Refer to Section 3.08.04.A(6)) 
                  d.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
                  i.  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; or 
                  ii.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions), or 
                  iii.  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "new construction", including the anchoring and elevation requirements of Section 3.08.04.B(3)a. and (3)c., above. 
                  4)  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Section 3.08.02.B, are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
                  b.  Only if Section 3.08.04.B(4)a. above is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Section 3.08.04. 
                  c.  Removal of trees and other vegetation may not be a consideration in calculating the effect of proposed encroachment on flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
                  5)  Floodway Fringe, Lower. Within the lower floodway fringe is the area between the floodway and the upper floodway fringe that is lower than one-half the distance between the floodway and the boundary of the area of special flood hazard. The lower floodway fringe is a transitional area that is hazardous due to its proximity to the floodway and encroachment by fill or development within this area could have serious impact on the entire floodplain. The following provisions shall apply with the lower floodway fringe: 
                  a.  Encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other developments shall be prohibited unless certification by a registered professional engineer, with supporting technical data, is provided to the director demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during occurrence of base flood discharge; 
                  b.  If Section 3.08.04.A(4)a. is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Section 3.08.04. 
                  c.  The placement of manufactured homes, except in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, shall be prohibited. A replacement manufactured home may be placed on a lot in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision provided the anchoring standards of Section 3.08.04.A(6), and the elevation standard of Section 3.08.04.B(1), and the encroachment standards of Section 3.08.04.B(4)a. are met. 
                  d.  Removal of trees and other vegetation may not be a consideration in effects of proposed encroachment on flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
                  6)  Large Tracts. If a tract contains over one acre located within the area of special flood hazard, then development or land disturbance on that portion of the tract located within the special flood hazard area shall comply with the standards for lower floodway fringe set forth in subsection B(5). 
                  7)  Other Area Unsuitable for Development. Land subject to flooding that is not located within a mapped area of special flood hazard may, at the discretion of the Director of Floodplain Management, be required to comply with any or all standards set forth in this chapter. 
                  8)  Grading in the Area of the Special Flood Hazard. Grading (including excavating, filing, or any culmination thereof) shall be prohibited in the area of the special flood hazard except for the following: 
                  a.  Minimum land-disturbing activities such as home gardens and individual home landscaping, repairs, maintenance work and other related activities. 
                  b.  Agricultural practices involving the establishment, cultivation or harvesting or products of the field or orchard, preparing and planting of pasture land, forestry land management practices including harvesting (where stumps are not removed), farm ponds, dairy operations, livestock and poultry management practices and the construction of farm buildings; 
                  c.  Projects permitted by or carried out under the technical supervision of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, or any other agency of the U.S. Government; 
                  d.  Cemetery graves; 
                  e.  Excavation for wells or tunnels or utilities; 
                  f.  Approved mining, quarrying, stockpiling of rock, sand, gravel aggregates or clay where established and provided by law; 
                  g.  Exploratory excavations under the direction of soil engineering geologist; 
                  h.  Where consistent with other provisions of this chapter, minimum grading for land development or construction which does not result in topographic changes greater than two feet at any location and which is not for the sole purpose of elevating structures pursuant to Section 3.08.04.B(1) and Section 3.08.04.B(2) of this chapter. In no case, shall fill be transported into the area of Special Flood Hazard. 
                  i.  Construction activities at existing industrial sites which were developed before the effective date of the first Floodplain Management Ordinance adopted by Catoosa County, GA as a basis for Catoosa County's participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), such as dikes, ditches and ponds. 
                  j.  Grading (including excavating, filling, or any culmination thereof) shall be permitted in the Upper Fringe. 
                  9)  As-Built Drawings and Certification. Within the area of the special flood hazard, as-built drawings and certifications shall be provided by a registered professional engineer and/or a registered land surveyor pursuant to Section 3.08.03.B(2) and Section 3.08.04.B(2) of this Section and also when required by the site plan regulations or the subdivision regulations. As-built drawings and other certifications may be required in other situations at the discretion of the Director of Floodplain Management. 
                  C.  Building Standards for Streams Without Established Base Flood Elevations and/or Floodway (A-Zones). Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in Section 3.08.02.B, where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A-Zones), or where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions apply: 
                  1)  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with Section 3.08.02.B, then the Director shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of Section 3.08.04. only if data are not available from these sources, then the following provisions (2) and (3) shall apply: 
                  2)  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to three times the width of the stream or 50 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. However, if detail studies show that the minimum standards of the encroachment could be detrimental to the natural floodplain, the Catoosa County Stormwater Director would make the final determination. 
                  3)  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. (Note: Require the lowest floor to be elevated two and seven-tenths feet above the estimated base flood elevation in A-Zone areas where a limited detail study has been completed). Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of Section 3.08.04.A(4) "Elevated Buildings". 
                  a.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. 
                  The Director shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
                  D.  Standards for Areas of Shallow Flooding (AO-Zones). Areas of special flood hazard established in Section 3.08.02.B, may include designated "AO" shallow flooding areas. These areas have base flood depths of one to three feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. The following provisions apply: 
                  1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with standards of Section 3.08.04.A(4), "Elevated Buildings". 
                  The Director shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
                  2)  New construction or the substantial improvement of a nonresidential structure may be flood-proofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to the specified FIRM flood level plus two foot, above highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and as required in Section 3.08.03.B(1)c. and Section 3.08.03.B(2). 
                  3)  Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure. 
                  E.  Standards for Subdivisions. 
                  1)  All subdivision and/or development proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage; 
                  2)  All subdivision and/or development proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage; 
                  3)  All subdivision and/or development proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards; and 
                  4)  For subdivisions and/or developments greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is less, base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision and all other proposed development, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions. Any changes or revisions to the flood data adopted herein and shown on the FIRM shall be submitted to FEMA for review as a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) or conditional letter of map amendment (CLOMA), whichever is applicable. Upon completion of the project, the developer is responsible for submitting the "as-built" data to FEMA in order to obtain the final LOMR. 
                  5)  If the planned subdivision shows the floodplain is contained entirely within an open space lot, it may not be necessary to conduct a detailed engineering analysis to develop BFE data. Also, it may not be necessary to develop detailed BFE data in "large-lot" subdivisions or single lot subdivisions that are within the thresholds under subparagraph 60.3(b)(3) of the NFIP regulations when the actual building sites are clearly outside the Zone A area. 
                  F.  Standards for Critical Facilities. 
                  1)  Critical facilities shall not be located in the 100-year floodplain or the 500-year floodplain. 
                  2)  All ingress and egress from any critical facility must be protected to the 500-year flood elevation. 
                  (Ord. of 9-19-17(2)) 
                  3.08.05   Variance Procedures
                  A.  The Board of Commissioners as established by Catoosa County shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this Section. 
                  B.  The Board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the Stormwater Director in the enforcement or administration of this Section. 
                  C.  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Board of Commissioners may appeal such decision to the Superior Court of Catoosa County, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1. 
                  D.  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  E.  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this Section are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  F.  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  G.  In reviewing such requests, the Board of Commissioners shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this Section. 
                  H.  Conditions for variances: 
                  1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  i.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
                  ii.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  iii.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  2)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  4)  The Stormwater Director shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  I.  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this Section, the Board of Commissioners may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this Section.

                  Existing construction means for the purposes of determining rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced before September 28, 1979. 
                  Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before March 12, 1987. 
                  Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed, including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads. 
                  Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
                  1)  The overflow of inland or tidal waters; or 
                  2)  The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source. 
                  Flood hazard boundary map (FHBM) means an official map of a community, issued by the Federal Insurance Administration, where the boundaries of areas of special flood hazard have been defined as Zone A. 
                  Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means an official map of a community, issued by the Federal Insurance Administration, delineating the areas of special flood hazard and/or risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
                  Flood insurance study the official report by the Federal Insurance Administration evaluating flood hazards and containing flood profiles and water surface elevations of the base flood. 
                  Floodplain means any land area susceptible to flooding. 
                  Flood-proofing, means any combination of structural and non-structural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures, which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents. 
                  Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
                  Floodway fringe, lower. The portion of the area of special flood hazard that is located between the limit of the floodway and a line connecting all points half the distance between the floodway and the limit of the area of special flood hazard. 
                  Floodway fringe, upper. The portion of the area of special flood hazard that is located between the lower floodway fringe and the boundary of the area of special flood hazard. 
                  Freeboard means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of floodplain management. "Freeboard" tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed. 
                  Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, adjacent to the proposed foundation of a building. 
                  Historic structure means any structure that is;

                  b.  Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs. 
                  Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement. An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage, in an area other than a basement, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of other provisions of this code. 
                  Manufactured home means a building, transportable in one or more sections, built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and similar transportable structures placed on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer and intended to be improved property. 
                  Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
                  Mean sea level means the average height of the sea for all stages of the tide. It is used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain. For purposes of this Section, the term is synonymous with National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD). 
                  National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) as corrected in 1929 is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
                  New construction means, for the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced after September 28, 1979, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced after March 12, 1987, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
                  New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after March 12, 1987. 
                  North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) as corrected in 1988 is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
                  Recreational vehicle means a vehicle, which is: 
                  1)  Built on a single chassis; 
                  2)  400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection;

                  4)  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
                  Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (Note: accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance requirements.) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
                  Subdivision is the division of a single lot into two or more lots for the purpose of sale or development. 
                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
                  Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the "start of construction" of the improvement. Note: The market value of the structure should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
                  For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include (1) those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the Code Enforcement Official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project, or (2) any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure". 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this Section, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this Section. 
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this Section is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  a.  Include, but not be limited to: wetlands, river buffer zones, woodlands, wildlife corridors, pastures, meadows, and similar natural property; 
                  b.  Be contiguous to the parcel on which the subdivision is located; 
                  c.  Be contiguous to other greenspace parcels, county parks, Corps of Engineers property, national parks, national forests and similar preserved land where possible; 
                  d.  Be undisturbed and undeveloped; 
                  e.  Be accessible by a county or state road, or by easement; 
                  f.  Not be used for hunting or by motorized recreational vehicles, and any deed of conveyance of greenspace to the county or land trust shall contain a deed restriction to that effect. 
                  2)  Alternative Greenspace. 
                  a.  The applicant may propose alternatives for the standard greenspace requirement. 
                  b.  The applicant may propose purchasing an equivalent amount of greenspace adjacent and contiguous to existing county greenspace elsewhere in the county; 
                  c.  The applicant may propose donating an equivalent amount of greenspace to an approved land trust; or 
                  d.  The applicant may propose submitting funds to purchase an equivalent amount of greenspace, to be paid into the county greenspace bank for future purchase of greenspace, at the county's discretion. 
                  i.  The dollar amount to be contributed and the fair market value of the proposed equivalent greenspace shall be based on appraisals approved by the Planning Commission and shall be considered at pre-development values. 
                  ii.  Payment or contribution of land shall occur prior to approval of the final plat. 
                  e.  Any arrangement under this subsection must also be approved by the Board of Commissioners. 
                  f.  Alternative greenspace arrangements require the voluntary cooperation of the applicant. Otherwise, the standard greenspace requirements established by this Section shall apply. 
                  3.09.04   Application Requirements
                  A conservation subdivision allows increased residential density in conjunction with the fee simple grant of undeveloped and undisturbed greenspace to the county or to such land trust as the county may designate. The following procedure shall apply to conservation subdivision applications: 
                  A.  The applicant seeking to develop a conservation subdivision must meet with the Zoning Administrator and provide a survey of the entire tract, prior to placement of lots and roads. 
                  B.  The county and the applicant shall then agree upon the tract to be donated. 
                  C.  Where possible, the tract to be donated should connect with other greenspace tracts or trails. 
                  D.  A minimum of one-half of the total acreage of the parcel must be donated to qualify for a conservation subdivision. 
                  E.  Alternative greenspace arrangements are also available as provided herein. 
                  3.09.05   Approval
                  A.  Approval of a conservation subdivision shall be granted or denied by the Catoosa County Planning Commission. The Planning Commission shall consider the following factors: 
                  1)  Whether the applicant has designated and offered to dedicate appropriate amounts and locations of greenspace. 
                  2)  Whether the conservation subdivision would be detrimental to the uses surrounding the property on which the subdivision is located. 
                  3)  Whether the terrain or location of the property is not suitable for a conservation subdivision, or is not desirable as greenspace.

                  Editor's note— Res. of 4-7-2015, adopted April 7, 2015, set out provisions intended for use as section 3.09.00. Inasmuch as there were three subsections designated as 3.09.01, the subsections of 3.09.00, §§ 3.09.01—3.09.04 have been codified herein as §§ 3.09.01—3.09.06 at the discretion of the editor so as to maintain sequential order. 

                  3.10.00 - RIDGELINES AND STEEP SLOPES 
                  3.10.01   Purpose and Intent
                  A.  The provisions of this Section are intended to prevent developments that will erode hillsides, result in sedimentation of lower slopes, cause damage from landslides or create potential for damage from landslides, flood downhill properties, result in the severe cutting of trees or the scarring of the landscape, or that cannot be served or accessed by public infrastructure, utilities or emergency services. 
                  B.  It is the intent of these development standards to encourage a sensitive form of development that protects the natural and topographic character of ridgelines and hillsides, ensures the public health, safety and welfare, and allows for a reasonable use that complements the natural and visual character of the community. 
                  3.10.02   General Provisions
                  A.  No land to which this Section applies shall hereafter be subdivided, cleared, developed or uses, and no building or structure shall be constructed, placed, extended, converted or structurally altered, except in full compliance with this Section. 
                  B.  This Section provides both regulations and guidelines. Regulations are identified by use of the term "shall" and compliance is mandatory. Guidelines are identified by use of the term "should" and compliance is not mandatory but is strongly recommended. Substantial inconsistencies with one or more guidelines in a manner that is clearly counter to the purposes of this Section may provide the basis for denial of a development by the Zoning Administrator. 
                  3.10.03   Land Unsuitable for Development
                  A.  Infrastructure and utilities are either unavailable or have limited availability for building envelopes on ridgelines in the unincorporated areas of Catoosa County in the following locations and elevations: 
                  1)  Building envelopes on ridgeline locations with elevations greater than 1,100 feet located on the west side of Taylor's Ridge and White Oak Mountain; and 
                  2)  Building envelopes on ridgeline locations with elevations greater than 1,200 feet located on the east side of Taylor's Ridge and White Oak Mountain. 
                  B.  Based upon the foregoing, building and development is prohibited on building envelopes at the aforementioned locations. For the purposes of this subsection, a building envelope is defined as that portion of a tract or parcel of land upon which a building is constructed or located or upon which development occurs. 
                  3.10.04   Development Guidelines
                  The following provisions shall apply to the development of property with a natural slope of 35 percent or more, or the development of property located on Taylor's Ridge or White Oak Mountain ridgelines having elevations equal to or less than those specified in Section 3.10.03.A even though such ridgelines may have a natural slope of less than 35 percent. 
                  A.  General Development Guidelines. 
                  1)  All grading, retaining wall design (retaining walls over 30 inches require engineering), drainage and erosion control plans for development subject to this Section shall be designed by a civil engineer. In cases where geologically hazardous areas exist, such plans shall be prepared by a qualified professional. 
                  2)  Development on the site should be located, designed and oriented so that grading and other site preparation are kept to the minimum needed to serve the intended building or use. 
                  3)  Projects involving more than one use or phase should be phased into workable units in a way that minimizes the amount of soil disturbance at any given point in time. 
                  4)  When grading must occur, it should blend with the natural landform as much as possible. Grading to form level pads and building sites is strongly discouraged and when required such grading should be minimized. 
                  5)  Existing deep-rooted vegetation, including trees, bushes, and groundcover, should be removed only in cases where necessary for building, roads, driveways, parking and minimal yards. View corridors from the proposed development to surrounding areas may be provided, but the thinning of limbs of individual trees is preferred over tree removal as a means to provide a view corridor. 
                  B.  Roads. 
                  1)  Roads should be designed to create the minimum feasible amounts of land coverage and the minimum feasible disturbance of the soil. 
                  2)  Road alignments should follow the natural terrain unless the project engineer can justify additional cuts or fills. Roads, walkways and parking areas should be designed to parallel the natural contours of the site. 
                  3)  Variations in road design and road construction standards specified in this UDC shall be permitted, as may be approved by the Director of Public Works, to prevent the dedication of unnecessarily large amounts of land. 
                  C.  Fire Protection. 
                  Reserved.

                  4.06.01   Street Tree Planting Requirements, General
                  A.  Any subdivision containing 12 or more lots shall be required to plant street trees which conform to the requirements of this Section of the UDC. 
                  B.  Street trees shall be planted behind the sidewalks except in subdivisions which contain a designated planting strip, at least 6 feet in width, between the street curb and the sidewalk. In such subdivisions, the street trees may be planted in the designated planting strip. 
                  4.06.02   Street Tree Selection
                  Street trees shall be native species that are appropriate for the Plant Hardiness Zone(s) for Catoosa County as defined by the Cooperative Extension, University of Georgia College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences. 
                  4.06.03   Street Tree Spacing, Placement and Pruning
                  A.  Unless otherwise approved by the Planning Commission due to special site conditions or safety concerns, the following requirements shall govern the spacing, placement and pruning of street trees: 
                  1)  Street trees shall be at least 2½ inches caliper measured and 6½ feet (American National Standard for Nursery Stock) above the finished grade of the ground. 
                  2)  Residential street trees shall be planted at the rate of one tree for every 50 linear feet of road frontage. Driveway widths may be subtracted when calculating the linear foot requirement of this subsection. 
                  3)  In commercial developments which do not contain street yard plantings, the developer shall either retain existing trees or plant new trees (or some combination of the two) along any frontage which is adjacent to public rights-of-way, such that there is an average within the development of at least one tree for every 30 feet of street frontage. The location of the trees may be varied, however, spacing of trees shall be no less than a minimum of one tree for each 100 feet of street frontage. Driveway widths may be subtracted calculating the linear foot requirement of this subsection. 
                  4)  Trees shall not be planted closer than 25 feet from the curb line of intersections of streets or alleys, and not closer than 10 feet from private driveways (measured at the back edge of the sidewalk), fire hydrants or utility poles. 
                  5)  Street trees shall not be planted closer than 20 feet from light standards. Except in situations required to protect public safety, no new light standard shall be positioned closer than 10 feet to any existing street tree and it shall be preferable that new light standards be positioned at least 20 feet from any existing street tree. 
                  6)  Except in situations meeting the requirements for a designated planting strip, trees shall not be planted closer than 13 feet from the face of the curb. 
                  7)  Trees shall not be planted within 3 feet of any permanent hard surface paving or walkway. Any concrete cuts in sidewalks for trees shall be at least 10 square feet in area. However, larger cuts are encouraged in order to promote the overall health of trees planted. Spaces between planted trees and the adjacent hard surface may be covered with permeable, nonpermanent hard surfaces such as grates, bricks on sand or paver blocks. 
                  8)  As planted trees grow, they shall be pruned to provide at least eight feet of clearance above sidewalks and 12 feet of clearance above road surfaces. 
                  9)  Existing trees within a development may be used as street trees if there has been no damage to the tree from the development which would kill or otherwise weaken the tree. Subject to the approval of the planning commission, sidewalks of varying widths and elevations from the standard width and elevation requirements may be utilized in order to save existing trees. 
                  10)  All street tree pruning requirements imposed by this Section shall at all times be the responsibility of either the property owner upon whose property the tree is located, the developer of the subdivision or a homeowners' association and shall not be the responsibility of Catoosa County. 
                  4.06.04   Street Tree Replacement
                  A.  Existing street trees removed by development activity shall be replaced by the developer. 
                  B.  The replacement trees shall be of size and species similar to those removed or shall be of a native species that are appropriate for the Plant Hardiness Zone(s) for Catoosa County as defined by the Cooperative Extension, University of Georgia College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences 
                  C.  Existing street trees which die shall be replaced with street trees which meet the requirements of this ordinance. 
                  D.  All street tree replacement requirements imposed by this Section shall at all times be the responsibility of either the property owner upon whose property the tree is located, the developer of the subdivision or a homeowners' association and shall not be the responsibility of Catoosa County. 
                  4.07.00 - LIGHTING REQUIREMENTS, BUILDINGS 
                  A.  Application.

                  B.  Requirements. The exterior lighting of all buildings and other structures to which the provisions of this Section are applicable shall, to the greatest extent possible, be installed such that the lighting source is shrouded, recessed or otherwise indirect such that the lighting source is not visible from the public right-of-way of any public road or street. The lighting shall also contain the minimum wattage necessary to service the property and shall utilize all reasonable methods (e.g. location, glare reduction, etc.) necessary to carry out and otherwise meet the requirements of this subsection. 
                  C.  Exceptions. In the event the requirements of subsection (B) hereof cannot be met with respect to any particular building or structure, the exterior lighting of said building or structure may be installed in a manner approved by the Zoning Administrator, in his discretion, provided said installation protects, to the greatest extent possible, the safety of motorists utilizing the public roads and streets and adjoining property owners. In determining whether a particular building or structure meets the requirements of this subsection, the Zoning Administrator shall review such factors as the location of lighting, the type of lighting utilized (including lamp wattage), the amount of lighting utilized and the amount of glare projected onto neighboring properties and/or public streets. After reviewing the factors set forth herein and the plan for the building and/or structure, the Zoning Administrator shall have the discretion to accept, reject or modify the lighting plan for the building and/or structure to ensure that the safety and other concerns set forth herein are met. Any final decision of the Zoning Administrator shall be appealable pursuant to the terms of this UDC. 
                  4.08.00 - BUFFERS 
                  4.08.01   Buffers, Generally
                  A.  Buffers shall separate different use districts and/or uses on one property from uses on another property of the same use district of a different use district. 
                  B.  Buffers, including natural plantings and/or structural treatments, shall be located on the site to best achieve the screening required, in accordance with the County approved site plan. 
                  C.  The buffer area shall supersede the setback line distance but may be included in the distance to determine a setback. 
                  D.  A buffer area may be used for vehicular access and utility easements and for drainage improvements required by the County. 
                  4.08.02   Buffers, Where Required
                  A.  An adequate buffer strip of at least 50 feet in width shall be required and maintained between single-family conventional residential property in any zone and any area zoned other than R-1, R-2, R-A, A-1, or PCFD. Such buffer shall be constructed and/or maintained by the owner of the land zoned other than R-1, R-2, R-A or A-1, unless the conditions described in subsection E. below are present. 
                  B.  An adequate buffer strip at least 50 feet in width shall be required and maintained between any manufactured home and any single-family, two-family, tri-plex, quadplex or multi-family residential housing or zoning district. Evergreen or opaque screening will usually be required between any manufactured home and any non-manufactured home dwellings or zoning districts. Sufficient screening may be provided by natural vegetation that provides a substantially opaque natural screen, or the topography or other conditions existing at the site may provide a substantially opaque screen. 
                  C.  A buffer strip of at least 50 feet in width shall be required and maintained between any area zoned commercial, (C-1, C-2 or C-3), and any residential property in any zone. Such buffer shall be constructed and/or maintained by the owner of the land zoned as commercial, unless the conditions described in subsection E. below are present. 
                  D.  A buffer strip of at least 100 feet in width shall be required and maintained between any area zoned industrial (I-1 or I-2), and any other zone. Such buffer shall be constructed and/or maintained by the owner of the land zoned as industrial, unless the conditions described in subsection E. below are present. 
                  E.  When a proposed development adjoins an existing development of a higher intensity, but the full width of the required buffer does not exist on the existing development, the new development shall provide a buffer of adequate width to meet the full width requirements as presented in this Section when considered in combination with any existing buffer on the property of the adjoining existing development. 
                  4.08.03   Buffers, Minimum Screening
                  A.  A buffer shall be provided that creates a barrier between dissimilar land uses or properties. Said buffer shall substantially block such attributes as sight lines, noise transmission, dust, and the transfer of artificial light and reflected light between dissimilar land uses or properties. 
                  B.  Unless otherwise specified in this UDC, a required buffer can take the form of blinders, opaque walls, opaque fences, opaque blocking, fence slats, trees or shrubs (including evergreen trees and shrubs that can provide an opaque visual screen during all seasons of the year), or dirt or rock embankments to block the attribute, or specific devices used to muffle, control, modify, or reduce the level of such attribute. 
                  C.  A required buffer shall also incorporate optimal placement of the foregoing components on the property and in relationship to the adjoining property, so as to provide the most effective barrier described above. This shall include particular consideration to the vertical relationship, lines of sight and resulting view angles between differing land uses and adjoining properties and may involve the grading design, building heights, architectural styles, and placement of design elements on the property being developed. 
                  D.  Vegetation and/or topography or other conditions existing at the site that contribute to or create an effective barrier may be used to meet buffer requirements. 
                  4.08.04   Natural Buffers
                  Natural buffers may contain deciduous or perennial vegetation, but shall contain evergreen shrubs and trees suitable to local growing conditions that will provide an opaque visual screen during all seasons of the year. An example of a natural buffer is shown below: 

                  4.08.05   Structural Buffers
                  Fences used in buffers shall: 
                  A.  Be located no closer to the property line than 2 feet; 
                  B.  Present a finished and decorative appearance to the abutting property; and 
                  C.  Be made of rot-resistant material or protected from deterioration with waterproofing materials. 
                  Examples of structural buffers are shown below: 

                  4.08.06   Buffers, Maintenance
                  A.  Screening shall be deemed to be a continuing requirement. 
                  B.  The screens required shall be maintained by the landowner, and the zoning entity may require replacement, replanting or such other screening maintenance that will ensure that the screen or barrier continues to serve the purpose for which it was intended. 
                  C.  Every buffer required under this Article shall be maintained so as to provide an opaque visual screen of a minimum height of 8 feet on a continuous, year-round basis unless otherwise specified in this UDC. 
                  4.08.07   Buffers, Special Uses
                  In addition to all other provisions of Section 4.08.00, a proposed use requiring a Special Use Permit (see also Article IX) may be required to have additional barriers and screens (that is, of the additional type, additional size, additional depth, additional height, additional arrangement and other specific additional characteristics). 
                  A.  The criteria for determining whether such screens or barriers shall be required shall be made upon a balancing of the property owners' need for the proposed use (without the use of such screens or barriers) as weighed against any depreciating effects to neighboring properties and to persons occupying such neighboring properties that could be remedied by screening or barriers. In balancing such factors, the Board of Commissioners shall consider the following: 
                  1)  The aesthetic effect of the attribute (of the use causing the need for any screening or barriers) upon the neighboring properties; 
                  2)  The extent to which such attribute interferes with the enjoyment and use of neighboring properties; 
                  3)  The practical effect that any screening or barriers would have on the level of any interference with the enjoyment and use of neighboring properties; and 
                  4)  The time of day or night that the attribute typically interferes with neighboring properties or to persons occupying such neighboring properties. 
                  B.  Where the depreciating effects outweigh the property owner's need for the proposed use (without the use of screens or barriers), then screening or barriers shall be required as set forth as follows: 
                  1)  In determining the size, location, depth, height, arrangement, distance and type of screens or barriers to be required, the Board of Commissioners shall only impose such requirements as will be expected to protect other properties (provided however that such buffers shall not exceed the depth or dimensions of those needed to provide protection from injurious effects on other properties, or of the largest buffer depth and dimensions otherwise provided for in this UDC, whichever is less). 
                  2)  Unless natural barriers such as trees, dirt banks, etc., are in existence on the buffer area that exceed 15 feet in height, such screens or barriers shall not be required to measure in excess of 15 feet in height when erected (however, blinders or other devices may be required to hang or be placed at levels higher than 30 feet from the ground level). 
                  3)  The following requirements shall apply to such screens and barriers: 
                  a.  They shall not be required to be of a depth in excess of the buffer zone depth required elsewhere in this UDC; 
                  b.  They shall not be in such location as would not block the view of or noise from such attribute to other property, to a public street or to a public road; 
                  c.  They shall not be of such arrangement as would require the complete destruction or loss of use of a complete building or buildings; 
                  d.  They shall not be of such distance as would extend beyond the boundary lines of the subject property; and 
                  e.  They shall not be of such type as would cost sums disproportionate to other less expensive alternatives that are available and proposed by the landowner which would accomplish a similar result in terms of alleviating the attribute causing interference. 
                  4)  The Board of Commissioners shall consider and review any less expensive alternative modifications to operations, alternative barriers or screens, or other muffling devices proposed in writing by the landowner and the extent to which that may be anticipated to accomplish such similar result. 
                  4.08.08   Buffers, Prohibited Uses or Activities
                  A.  A buffer area may not be used for the erection of any permanent structure thereon except for fencing or sign installed in accordance with applicable provisions of this UDC. 
                  B.  A buffer area may not be used for any parking. 
                  C.  A buffer area may be used for the construction of drainage improvements, field lines, septic tanks, sewer lines or other underground piping improvements that cannot be viewed from aboveground. 
                  D.  Except as provided herein, the natural topography of the land shall be preserved and natural growth shall not be disturbed beyond that which is necessary to prevent a nuisance, or to thin such natural growth where too dense for normal growth, or to remove diseased, misshapen, or dangerous and decayed timbers. However, a slope easement may be cleared and graded where required to prevent soil erosion upon approval of the Stormwater Director. Furthermore, selective cutting of timbers or trees may be allowed upon the approval by the Zoning Administrator of a written plan providing for replacement planting or screening that is no less opaque than were the original timbers or trees.

                  1)  In determining whether to allow the raising of other nondomesticated animals not listed in this subsection, the Board of Commissioners shall balance the benefits of raising the proposed type of animal with any possible detrimental effects that the raising of such animal may have on other properties; 
                  2)  In conducting such balancing, the Board of Commissioners shall consider any objections made by other property owners, the approximate degree of emission of odors from this type of animal(s) or from its actions, the tendency of such animal(s) to escape fenced or other types of confinement, the noise typically emitted by this type of animal(s), any particular health aspects of such animal(s) and the approximate life span of such animal(s).

                  The Telecommunications Act of 1996 affirmed the authority of Catoosa County concerning the placement, construction and modification of wireless telecommunications facilities. Pursuant to Section 704(a) of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, it is not the intent of this Section to prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services in Catoosa County. It is the intent of this section to balance the interests of the county's residents, telecommunications providers and telecommunications customers in the siting of wireless telecommunications facilities within Catoosa County so as to protect the health, safety, and welfare of county citizens and the character and integrity of the built and natural environment. 
                  5.04.02   Overall Policy and Goals
                  In order to ensure that the placement, construction, and modification of wireless telecommunication facilities is consistent with the purpose and intent of this section, Catoosa County adopts an overall policy with respect to requiring permits for wireless telecommunications facilities for the express purpose of achieving the following goals: 
                  A.  Requiring a special use permit to place, construct or make significant modifications to a wireless facility. 
                  B.  Requiring review by the Zoning Administrator and application for an electrical permit and building permit in accordance with requirements of this Section, rather than requiring a special use permit, for any new collocation or minor modification of an existing wireless telecommunications facility. 
                  C.  Requiring, wherever possible, the placement, height and quantity of wireless telecommunications facilities in such a manner, including but not limited to the use of stealth technology, to minimize adverse aesthetic and visual impacts on the land, property, buildings, and other facilities adjacent to, surrounding, and in generally the same area as the requested location of such wireless telecommunications facilities, which shall mean using the least visually and physically intrusive facility that is not technologically or commercial impracticable under the facts and circumstances. 
                  D.  Requiring, wherever possible, the collocation of wireless facilities. 
                  5.04.03   Collocation Required
                  A.  All service providers shall be required to collocate prior to being considered for a stand-alone site, or demonstrate co-location is impossible or impractical. 
                  B.  No service provider shall prohibit collocation nor charge an unreasonable fee to another service provider. 
                  5.04.04   Special Use Permit Required
                  The following actions shall require a special use permit in accordance with the requirements of this Section and Article IX of this UDC: 
                  A.  The placement or construction of any new wireless support structure. 
                  B.  The collocation or modification to a previously approved wireless facility that proposes: 
                  1)  An increase the overall height or width of the wireless support structure to which the wireless facilities are to be attached; 
                  2)  An increase in the dimensions of the equipment compound initially approved by Catoosa County; 
                  3)  To exceed the applicable weight limits for the wireless support structure, as demonstrated by a letter from a structural engineer licensed to practice in this state. 
                  5.04.05   Exceptions from a Special Use Permit
                  A.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this section, wireless facilities that existed on or before the effective date of this UDC shall be allowed to continue as they presently exist, provided however, that any modification of an existing wireless telecommunications facility that meets the criteria of Section 5.04.04.D.(2) will require the complete facility to comply with this section. 
                  B.  Any repair and maintenance of a wireless facility does not require an application for a special use permit. However, no additional construction or site modification will be permitted. 
                  C.  Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.0.04, the collocation on previously approved wireless facilities shall be subject only to review by the Zoning Administrator and application for an electrical permit and building permit. 
                  5.04.06   Height Limitations on Telecommunications Towers by District

                  Tower height may not exceed the maximum allowable heights identified in Sections 5.02.05.F.(2) and (3) unless it can be proven that such height would prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of service in the intended service area. 
                  5.04.07   Minimum Setbacks

                  5.05.00 - SIGNS 
                  5.05.01   Findings and Purpose
                  A.  The Board of Commissioners finds that signs provide an important medium through which individuals, businesses, and government may convey a variety of messages. Left unregulated, however, signs can become a threat to the public health and safety as a traffic hazard and a detriment to property values and the overall economic growth of Catoosa County as an aesthetic nuisance. 
                  B.  Numerous professional studies have been prepared that examine and establish the effect of signs on traffic safety, aesthetics and economic prosperity, including "The Public Purpose of Roswell's Sign Ordinance and the Implications of Doing Without It: A Position Paper" (December 7, 1999) by Jerry Weitz, Ph.D., AICP and "Safety Impacts of the Emerging Digital Display Technologies for Outdoor Advertising Signs" (April 2009) by Jerry Wachtel for AASHTO and the Standing Committee on Research of the National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP). In particular, based on the cited materials and the studies referenced therein as well as other related studies, the County finds that unregulated signs: 
                  1)  Can be a safety hazard to drivers and pedestrians; 
                  2)  Can distract drivers; 
                  3)  Can create unsafe, cluttered and aesthetically blighted thoroughfares throughout the County; 
                  4)  Can hamper economic growth; 
                  5)  Can lower property values; 
                  6)  Can adversely impact public investments; 
                  7)  Can degrade the utility of public safety signs; and 
                  8)  Can adversely impact the aesthetic quality of the community and surrounding environment. 
                  C.  It is the purpose of these sign regulations, through a comprehensive system of content-neutral and nondiscriminatory standards, to: 
                  1)  Balance the right of individuals to convey their messages through signs and the right of the public to be protected against the unrestricted proliferation of signs; 
                  2)  Further the objectives of the Catoosa County Comprehensive Plan; 
                  3)  Reduce traffic and pedestrian hazards; 
                  4)  Maintain the historical heritage and natural landscapes of the County; 
                  5)  Protect property values by minimizing the possible adverse effects and visual blight caused by signs; 
                  6)  Avoid the harmful aspects of the unrestricted proliferation of signs; 
                  7)  Promote economic development and tourism; 
                  8)  Protect private property values; and 
                  9)  Ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign regulations.

                  G.  The minimum length of crest vertical curves shall be 100 feet. Longer lengths may be required based on required stopping sight distance. The sight distance for crest vertical curves shall be measured along the roadway from 3½ feet above the pavement to an object 6 inches high, as discussed in the current AASHTO policy on design. 
                  H.  Vertical curves may be designed to extend past the end of a cul-de-sac provided stopping sight distance is met. See Standard Detail 203 "Minimum Stopping Sight Distance." 
                  I.  The minimum length of sag vertical curves shall be 100 feet. For Residential 3 and Nonresidential 1 class streets, minimum sag vertical curve length shall be 10 times the algebraic difference in grades, but in no case shall be less than 100 feet. Vertical curves may be designed to extend passed the end of a cul-de-sac provided stopping sight distance is met. 
                  J.  Sight distances at intersections shall be determined by the posted speed limit of the street (existing county road or state highway) onto which a vehicle must turn. Such distances shall be measured beginning from a point established 15 feet from the edge of the travel way on the centerline of the egress lane at a height of 3½ feet above the finish grade elevation. The line of sight is then extended the minimum required distance on either side to the centerline of the road terminating at a point 2 feet above the finish grade elevation (See Standard Detail 204 "Intersection Sight Distance for Driveways and Side Streets.") 
                  K.  If a subdivision street accesses a county road, the design consultant shall verify the intersection stopping distance and shall determine if hidden dips occur on the county road which will impact the proposed access point. 
                  L.  Roads may be constructed across an existing or proposed dam. The appropriate state approved professional shall provide a report certifying that the existing or proposed dam is structurally capable of supporting the road. Any road across a dam shall be a private street. Ingress and egress easements, not right-of-way, shall be granted. A second point of access to the subdivision across a public or private street must be provided. The section of road across the dam, and the dam itself, shall be maintained by the subdivision property owners or a mandatory homeowners' association. 
                  6.03.02   Residential Street Design Requirements
                  A.  Residential streets shall be classified into a street hierarchy system for design and construction purposes. Street design standards in residential subdivisions shall be based on road function and the number of dwelling units (d.u.) served by the street. Rural residential streets may be used only in residential subdivisions where lot sizes are five acres or larger. Residential street classifications and their corresponding dwelling unit thresholds are: 
                  Table 6-1 Residential Street Classifications and Dwelling Unit Thresholds

                  A.  Within the zoning districts established by this UDC there may exist lots, structures, or uses of land which were lawfully established before this UDC was adopted but which do not comply with the requirements set forth in this UDC. 
                  B.  It is the intent of this Section to allow these nonconformities to continue until they are removed or discontinued. It is further the intent of this Section that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district. 
                  C.  Once a building permit, development permit or special use permit has been issued by the zoning entity, a landowner has a right to develop the property pursuant to that permit during the term of such permit as specified in this UDC (but not thereafter), notwithstanding a zoning change subsequent to the issuance of the building/development permit. 
                  8.02.02   Nonconforming Lots
                  A lot of record whose area, frontage, width or other dimensions, or location were lawful prior to the adoption or amendment of this UDC, and which, by reason of such adoption or amendment, no longer meets or exceeds one or more such requirements of the applicable zoning district, may be developed with any use that is allowed in the district. The following requirements shall also apply: 
                  A.  All other requirements of the zoning district in which the lot is located are met. 
                  B.  Building plans shall be consistent with all state and local codes. 
                  C.  Single Lots. Where the owner of a lot at the time of the adoption of this ordinance or his successor in title thereto does not own sufficient land to enable him to conform to the dimensional requirements of this ordinance, such lot may be used as a building site for a single-family residence in a district where residences are permitted provided that the development of the lot is in compliance with any subdivision regulations and restrictions applicable thereto. 
                  D.  Adjoining Lots. If two or more adjoining lots with continuous frontage are in a single ownership at any time after the adoption of this ordinance and such lots individually are too small to meet the yard, width and area requirements of the district in which they are located, such groups of lots shall be considered as a single lot or several lots of minimum permitted size and the lot or lots in one ownership shall be subject to the requirements of this ordinance. 
                  E.  Mobile homes located in a nonconforming mobile home park space shall not be replaced when space is vacated unless that space is brought up to conformity, and new spaces may not be added to existing mobile home parks unless developed in compliance with this UDC. 
                  8.02.03   Continuance of Nonconforming Use
                  Except for the provisions of this Article concerning zoning with compensation (see Section 8.02.06), the lawfully established use of any building or structure or land existing at the time of the enactment of this UDC that becomes nonconforming at the time of adoption or amendment of this UDC may continue subject to the following requirements: 
                  A.  A nonconforming use shall not be changed to another nonconforming use; provided however, that a structure that is being leased which loses its tenant may alter that use to a use that is allowed under the same zoning classification as the previous tenant had used it (for example, a building that is being leased for an industrial use may continue to lease to an industrial tenant) subject to the requirements of this Article and the barrier/screening requirements that may be required in Article IV. 
                  B.  A nonconforming use shall be allowed to continue within the confines of any structure in which it may be operating, subject to the following requirements: 
                  1)  The use may continue and the volume or intensity of such nonconforming use or activity may be extended throughout any parts of a building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption or amendment of this UDC. 
                  2)  The use shall not be extended to occupy any structures or land outside the existing structure devoted to the use. 
                  C.  A nonconforming use which is superseded by an allowed use shall not thereafter be resumed. 
                  D.  A nonconforming use shall in no way be extended or relocated, either on the same or adjoining property. 
                  E.  A nonconforming use shall not be reestablished after discontinuance of such use for one (1) year, regardless of any reservation of intent not to abandon. 
                  F.  Notwithstanding any provisions of this UDC that may be to the contrary, a nonconforming use or structure that is damaged or destroyed by fire, natural deterioration or other natural disaster to an extent less than or equal to 50 percent of its fair market value immediately prior to damage or destruction may be rebuilt, altered or repaired only as provided herein: 
                  1)  Restoration shall be commenced within 12 months from the date damages were incurred. 
                  2)  If reconstruction is not commenced within 12 months, the reconstruction and use of the land or structure shall thereafter conform to the provisions of this UDC. 
                  3)  Fair market value shall be determined by reference to current statutory provisions pertaining to the valuation of real property for ad valorem tax purposes. 
                  G.  A structure damaged or destroyed by any means to an extent equal to or greater than 50 percent of its fair market value at time of damage or destruction shall be reconstructed only in conformity with the provisions of this UDC. 
                  8.02.04   Nonconforming Structures
                  A lawfully established structure that becomes nonconforming at the time of adoption of this UDC may continue subject to the following requirements: 
                  A.  The nonconforming structure shall not be enlarged, with the exception that barns and/or poultry houses, including those in noncompliance as to setbacks, may be replaced provide the replacement structure is built on the exact location and is no more than 25 percent greater in square footage than the original structure. 
                  B.  Structures under physical construction (the terms "physical construction" shall refer to the completion of the digging of and laying of the entire masonry or other foundation for the structure) on the date of the adoption of this UDC, and that are under physical construction due to permits that were lawfully issued by Catoosa County, shall be allowed to be completed regardless of whether the use to be made in such structure would be in a nonconforming zone. 
                  C.  The structure or portion thereof may be altered to decrease its degree of nonconformity. 
                  D.  If a nonconforming structure is moved for any reason for any distance, it shall be brought into conformance with the building, site design, and use requirements of the zoning district to which it is moved. 
                  E.  When any use of a nonconforming structure is discontinued for a continuous period in excess 12 months, any future use of the structure is permissible only when the structure has been brought into compliance with the provisions of this UDC. 
                  8.02.05   Nonconforming Signs
                  A.  [Nonconforming sign.] A nonconforming sign is a sign that was lawfully erected and maintained prior to the adoption or amendment of this Development Code, and which by reason of such adoption or amendment fails to conform to all applicable regulations and restrictions of this Development Code. 
                  B.  Grandfathered nonconforming signs. A nonconforming sign that is permanently affixed to the ground or to a building may continue to be used, except that the nonconforming sign shall not be replaced, expanded, relocated or substantially renovated except in conformity with the provisions of this Development Code. 
                  C.  Temporary signs to be removed. Any nonconforming sign that is temporary in nature and not permanently affixed to the ground or to a building, such as but not limited to a portable sign, a streamer or pennant, shall be removed within 30 days of becoming a nonconforming sign. 
                  D.  Treatment of Illegal Signs. 
                  1)  The following requirements shall apply to illegal signs located within a public right-of-way or on public lands: 
                  a.  Signs located illegally within any public right-of-way or other public lands shall be removed immediately upon adoption of this Development Code. 
                  b.  The Code Enforcement Director or other county employee(s), (and/or private individuals, corporations and entities, if so authorized by the Board of Commissioners), shall be authorized to remove and dispose of nonconforming signs from public rights-of-way and other public lands with or without notice to and at the expense of the owner, builder or other parties responsible for placement of said sign. 
                  2)  The following requirements shall apply to illegal signs not located within a public right-of-way or on public lands: 
                  a.  A sign that did not lawfully exist under the County's regulations prior to adoption of this Development Code shall, within 30 days of adoption of this Development Code, either be removed or be brought into conformance with all provisions of this Development Code.

                  8.02.06   Zoning with Compensation
                  A.  General Provisions. 
                  1)  From time to time, the use of existing land, buildings or structures might need to change depending upon the character of the neighborhood. The governing authority (upon the recommendation of the Planning Commission) may change the zoning of property and discontinue the preexisting use thereof by amending the zoning map and paying compensation to the landowner for the discontinuance of an existing use. 
                  a.  In the event that the governing authority and the landowner cannot agree upon a price to be paid for the discontinuance of such use, then the governing authority shall pay its proposed price into the registry of the clerk of the superior court of Catoosa County, and may rezone the property to discontinue the existing use. 
                  b.  The landowner may either obtain said funds from the clerk of the superior court of Catoosa County or file an action similar to an inverse condemnation suit in the superior court of Catoosa County, Georgia. 
                  c.  The discontinuance of the existing use shall be accomplished immediately upon the rezoning or payment of such sum offered by the governing authority into the registry of the court, whichever shall occur last. 
                  d.  The governing authority shall be authorized to uniformly access a special tax against neighboring properties to reimburse the county for any payment or award of damages given to the landowner provided that such discontinuance of use is of benefit to the neighboring properties. 
                  e.  This "zoning with compensation" should only be accomplished after considerable input from property owners and from neighboring property owners. 
                  B.  Provisions Regarding Junkyards. 
                  1)  Subject to the provisions of this ordinance concerning zoning with compensation, any junkyard in existence on the date of the adoption of this ordinance shall be considered to be a valid nonconforming use only if: it is in full compliance with the legal requirements of the junkyard and junk motor vehicle control ordinance adopted by Catoosa County on February 10, 1984. 
                  2)  No junkyard shall be allowed solely on the contention that it is grandfathered, and no person shall acquire or hold vested rights to junkyard ownership other than by and through the provisions of this ordinance. 
                  3)  Any person affected by a junkyard established and maintained in violation of this ordinance, or the county attorney of Catoosa County, may file an appropriate action in the superior court of Catoosa County to enjoin any person, partnership, firm or corporation from maintaining a junkyard in violation of this ordinance. Upon determination by the court that such junkyard does not comply with the provisions of this ordinance, and is not subject to any exception to the [this] ordinance, the owner of such junkyard shall, within 30 days of such order, remove the junkyard; and in default thereof, the zoning administrator or his designees may take action to remove, obliterate or abate the junkyard, and may go on private property to accomplish such purpose. The zoning administrator may then submit, by registered or certified mail, a statement of expenses for such removal, obliteration or abatement to the person owning or operating such junkyard; and if payment is not made to the zoning administrator within 60 days of receipt thereof, such amount may be collected by an action at law. 
                  8.03.00 - VARIANCES 
                  8.03.01   Purpose
                  A.  When, due to the peculiar size, shape, topography or other unusual physical condition of the tract of land or when circumstances are such that a strict enforcement would inflict an unreasonable, unnecessary or peculiar hardship the Planning Commission may waive strict compliance with the provisions of this UDC and make necessary variances to accommodate the situation. 
                  B.  The existence of a nonconforming use of neighboring land, buildings or structures in the same district or of permitted or nonconforming uses in other districts shall not constitute sufficient reason for granting the requested variance. 
                  C.  In no event shall a variance be granted to permit a use in a zoning district that is prohibited in that district. 
                  D.  In determining whether or not to grant a variance, the Planning Commission shall consider, the following: 
                  1)  Whether there are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape or topography. 
                  2)  If the application of this UDC to this particular piece of property would create an unnecessary hardship. 
                  3)  Whether conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of property involved. 
                  4)  Whether the relief, if granted, would cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purposes and intent of this UDC. 
                  E.  The variance should be granted only if the applicant meets the burden of proving (by the preponderance of evidence) that the need for the proposed variance outweigh the detriments or deprecating effects to other properties or the public health, safety, or general welfare. 
                  8.03.02   Procedures
                  A.  Application. 
                  1)  The application shall be sworn to be true and correct and signed by the landowner (and his/her/its agent) requesting the variance, if applicable.

                  2)  An increase in the maximum height requirements for building construction on real property, if such variance does not allow space habitable by humans and is also approved by the Fire Marshal and would not result in an increase in the number of stories that would otherwise be allowed by the zoning district. 
                  3)  A reduction in the minimum off-street parking and loading regulations. 
                  4)  A reduction in the minimum width requirements for planted or undisturbed buffers.

                  9.02.07   Standards for Considering Zoning Changes
                  A.  Standards for Considering Rezoning Applications. 
                  In considering any application for a rezoning, the Board of Commissioners shall balance the interest in promoting the public health, safety, morality or general welfare against the right to the unrestricted use of property. In doing so the Board of Commissioners will consider the following objective factors that are relevant to the application. Emphasis may be placed on those criteria most applicable to the specific use proposed: 
                  1)  Will the zoning proposal permit a use that is suitable in view of the use, development and zoning of adjacent or nearby property? 
                  2)  Will the zoning proposal adversely affect the existing use or usability of adjacent or nearby property? 
                  3)  Does the subject property have a reasonable economic use as currently zoned? 
                  4)  Will the zoning proposal result in a use which will or could cause an excessive or burdensome use of existing streets, transportation facilities, utilities, schools, police protection, public health facilities or emergency medical service? 
                  5)  Is the zoning proposal in conformity with the policy and intent of the Comprehensive Plan for the physical development of the area? 
                  6)  What is the effect on the property value of the subject property should the existing zoning be retained? 
                  7)  If denied, will the effect on the subject property's value under the existing zoning be offset by the gain to the health, safety, morals or general welfare of the public? 
                  8)  If denied, how does the relative gain to the public compare to the hardship imposed upon the individual property owner? 
                  9)  Has the property been undeveloped an unusual length of time as currently zoned, considered in the context of land development in the area in the vicinity of the property? 
                  10)  Are these other existing or changing conditions affecting the use or development of the property which give supporting grounds for either approval or disapproval of the zoning proposal? 
                  11)  Would the change create an isolated district unrelated to the surrounding districts, such as spot zoning? 
                  12)  Are the present zoning district boundaries illogically drawn in relation to existing conditions in the area? 
                  13)  Is the change requested out of scale with the needs of the county as a whole or the immediate neighborhood? 
                  14)  Is it impossible to find adequate sites for the proposed use in districts permitting such use and already appropriately zoned? 
                  15)  Would there be an ecological or pollution impact resulting from major modifications to the land if the request is granted? 
                  16)  Is there reasonable evidence based upon existing and anticipated land use that would indicate a mistake was made in the original zoning of the property? 
                  B.  Standards for Considering Special Use Applications. 
                  In considering any application for a special use permit, the Board of Commissioners shall balance the particular requirements or need for the proposed use against any depreciating effects of such use on other properties or persons. The Board of Commissioners shall consider the following objective factors. Emphasis may be placed on those criteria most applicable to the specific use proposed: 
                  1)  Is adequate space for off-street parking provided? 
                  2)  Is the use consistent with the goals, policies, objectives, and intent of the Comprehensive Plan? 
                  3)  Is the proposed use consistent with the purpose and intent of the zoning district? 
                  4)  Are public facilities such as schools, water or sewer utilities, and police or fire protection adequate to serve the proposed use? 
                  5)  Is access into and out of the property adequate to provide for traffic and pedestrian safety, the anticipated type and volume of traffic flow, and access by emergency vehicles? 
                  6)  Is the type of street providing access to the use adequate to serve the proposed use? 
                  7)  Is the lot size sufficient in relation to the proposed use? 
                  8)  Are refuse, service, parking and loading areas on the property located or screened to protect other properties in the area from such adverse effects as noise, light, glare or odor? 
                  9)  Will the hours and manner of operation of the special use have no adverse effects on other properties in the area? 
                  10)  Will the height, size or location of the buildings or other structures on the property be compatible with the height, size or location of buildings or other structures on neighboring properties? 
                  9.02.08   Public Hearing Procedures, Zoning Change
                  A public hearing shall be held by the Planning Commission and the Board of Commissioners on each proposed zoning change, as follows: 
                  A.  The chair or an appointed designee acting as presiding official shall allow the Zoning Administrator as the first speaker to present the staff review and recommendation concerning the applicant's case. 
                  B.  Following this presentation, the applicant or the applicant's authorized designee shall be allowed to present the applicant's case and then shall also afford the applicant an opportunity, prior to a vote, to answer questions and respond to objections of others in attendance.

                  3)  Any amendment to or insertion of a new Article, Section, Subsection or Paragraph that is subject to the Georgia Zoning Procedures Law shall be considered and acted upon by the Board of Commissioners under the provisions of this Section.

                  9.06.01   Appeals, Hearings and Notice
                  A.  Any appeal from, or request for review of, the decision of a zoning entity must be filed within 30 days from the date of the decision of such entity. The date of the decision shall be the date the decision is written, signed by or on behalf of the zoning entity and recorded in its minutes. 
                  B.  Appeals from a decision of the Zoning Administrator to the Planning Commission may be taken by any person aggrieved or by any officer, department, board or bureau of Catoosa County affected by any decision of the Zoning Administrator. Such appeal shall be taken by filing with the Planning Commission a written appeal specifying the grounds therefor. If a form is provided for such use, it may be used, but any relevant additional attachments may be made to such form. 
                  C.  Review of a decision of the Planning Commission to the governing authority may be had by any person aggrieved, or by any officer, department, board, or bureau of Catoosa County affected by any decision of the Planning Commission or by the Zoning Administrator. Such review shall be taken by filing with the Planning Commission a written appeal specifying the grounds therefor. If a form is provided for such use, it may be used, but any relevant additional attachments may be made to such form. Within 10 days thereafter, the Planning Commission shall transmit to the governing authority all documents constituting the record of the hearing below. 
                  D.  The review by the governing authority shall be by means of exhibits, or other evidence submitted at the Planning Commission hearing (if a written transcript is requested by any affected person or by the governing authority, then the requesting entity shall bear the cost of preparation and submittal to the governing authority) unless the governing authority specifically makes a finding that the record needs supplementation; in such event, the governing authority may provide for a hearing by it or the Planning Commission for the purpose of receiving such supplemental evidence (such limited hearing will be conducted in substantially the same format as the procedures set forth in this ordinance for Planning Commission zoning hearings). The decision of the governing authority may affirm, reverse, modify and/or remand (with or without directions) the decision below and shall state the written reasons therefor; and such decision shall be rendered within 45 days from the date of the hearing it may hold. It shall be necessary for the party seeking review from the decision of the Planning Commission to obtain a majority vote of the members present of the governing authority in order to overrule or reverse the decision of the Planning Commission; otherwise, the decision of the Planning Commission shall stand. Recourse from a decision of the governing authority shall be to a court of competent jurisdiction when so provided by state law. A copy of such appeal shall be filed with the Planning Commission and the governing authority within five days from any court filing. The date of the hearing on the review shall be at its regular meeting of each month following the date of action by the Planning Commission. The governing authority may continue the hearing at the request of any party or upon its own request. 
                  9.06.02   Stay of Proceedings
                  An appeal stays all hearing proceedings (except for court orders) in furtherance of the action appealed from (or that review is sought from) unless the Zoning Administrator certifies after the notice of appeal shall have been filed with him that by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by an order which may be granted by the Planning Commission, governing authority or by a court of record on application, on notice to the Zoning Administrator, and on due cause shown. 
                  9.07.00 - JURISDICTION, ENFORCEMENT, VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES 
                  9.07.01   Primary Jurisdiction
                  A.  When violations of any portion of this UDC shall occur, the Zoning Administrator, Building Official or other designated enforcement officer shall issue a citation and prosecute said citation (with the advice and direction of the county attorney) in the magistrate court of Catoosa County. 
                  9.07.02   Enforcement
                  A.  The Zoning Administrator shall have the power to enforce the provisions of this Article, and may write citations or commence proceedings for violations as they appear upon complaint by aggrieved persons or otherwise. 
                  B.  In furtherance of his duties, the Zoning Administrator shall be relieved from any liability for trespass upon private property, provided he is in the scope of his duty. 
                  9.07.03   Penalties
                  A.  Any person violating any provision of this Article shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction shall be punished for each offense according to law with the fine to be not less than $50.00 and not more than $1,000.00, or 60 days or both. Each day such violation continues shall be deemed a separate offense. In addition to any other penalties that may be imposed in this ordinance, a double permit fee will be charged for violators not obtaining a building/development permit originally (prior to construction or development). 
                  B.  Penalties for violation. Where the court finds a defendant guilty of a violation of this Article or any other portion of the UDC the Zoning Administrator is charged to enforce, the court shall in all cases impose at least a $100.00 fine. 
                  9.07.04   Remedies
                  In case any building is in the process of being (or has been) erected, constructed, reconstructed, altered, repaired, converted or maintained, or any building or land is used in violation of the this UDC, the Zoning Administrator, or any other appropriate county authority, or any person who has suffered or will suffer annoyance, noise, traffic hazard or other harm in addition to or beyond or increased over conditions already existing prior to the alleged violation, in addition to any other remedies provided by law, may seek injunctive, mandamus or other appropriate relief to prevent (temporarily and/or permanently) or remedy (including the removal or destruction of a nonconforming structure, fill or other development) the violation. This ordinance shall be construed such that courts will be encouraged to freely grant interlocutory injunctions (even upon ex parte evidence if it finds upon affirmed evidence that the limited duration of such order would impose potentially less of a hardship on the owner/developer than it would on another (others) if the construction or use continued) until administrative legal remedies can be exhausted by the county. A specific legal remedy is the process of issuing a certificate of zoning compliance as set forth in Section 9.02.00. 
                  9.07.05   Indemnity
                  All zoning entities and members thereof exercising the powers and authority (either expressly or implicitly) provided for in this UDC are indemnified by the County for their actions so long as the same are exercised in good faith.
