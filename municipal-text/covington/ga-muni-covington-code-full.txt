COVINGTON - MUNICIPAL CODE 
____________ 
A Codification of the General Ordinances of  Covington, Georgia 
____________ 
Beginning with Supp. No. 18,  Supplemented by Municipal Code Corporation 
____________ 

> 
PREFACE 
The Covington, Georgia Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Matthew Bender & Company, Inc., its successor in interest. 
Beginning with Supplement No. 18, Municipal Code Corporation will be keeping this code current by regular supplementation. 
During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company. 
The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing all ordinances by date passed, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 18, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance dated January 22, 2019(2).

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
This code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code. 
Numbering System. 
The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
There are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by date passed and section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ordinance dated 6/16/08, § 1)) 
Beginning with Supplement No. 18, a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross-referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
The statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
As of Supplement No. 18, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
To find a specific ordinance in the code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the code. The table is organized by the date the ordinance passed and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
Beginning with Supplement No. 18, this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
Beginning with Supplement No. 18, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the date the ordinance passed, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX  Fee 5.04.030  Required when 5.04.010 
The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction Sheet will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
When originally published, the pages of this code were consecutively numbered. As of Supplement No. 18, when new pages are inserted with amendments, the pages will follow a "Point Numbering System". (Example: 32, 32.1, 32.2, 32.2.1, 32.2.2, 33.) Backs of pages that are blank will be left unnumbered but the number is "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version. You can send files to us as an e-mail attachment, by FTP, on a diskette or CD-ROM.

SUPPLEMENT HISTORY TABLE 
The table below allows users of this Code to quickly and accurately determine what ordinances have been considered for codification in each supplement. Ordinances that are of a general and permanent nature are codified in the Code Book and are considered "Included." Ordinances that are not of a general and permanent nature are not codified in the Code Book and are considered "Omitted." 
In addition, by adding to this table with each supplement, users of this Code of Ordinances will be able to gain a more complete picture of the Code's historical evolution.

3.12.070 - Community redevelopment tax incentive program. 
A.  Purpose. The existence of real property which is maintained in a blighted condition increases the burden of the state and local government by increasing the need for government services, including but not limited to social services, public safety services, and code enforcement services. Rehabilitation of blighted property decreases this need for such government services. 
In furtherance of its objective to eradicate conditions of slum and blight within the city, the mayor and council, in exercise of the powers granted to municipal corporations at Chapter 61, Urban Redevelopment, of Title 36 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, has designated those areas of the city where conditions of slum and blight are found or are likely to spread. 
In recognition of the need for enhanced governmental services and in order to encourage private property owners to maintain their real property and the buildings, structures and improvement thereon in good condition and repair, and as an incentive to encourage community redevelopment, a community redevelopment tax incentive program is hereby established as authorized by Article IX, Section II, Paragraph VII (d) of the 1983 Constitution of the State of Georgia. 
B.  Definitions. 
"Blighted property, blighted, or blight" means any urbanized or developed property which:

c.  An imminent harm to life or other property caused by fire, flood, hurricane, tornado, earthquake, storm, or other natural catastrophe respecting which the governor has declared a state of emergency under the state law or has certified the need for disaster assistance under federal law; provided, however, this division shall not apply to property unless the relevant public agency has given notice in writing to the property owner regarding specific harm caused by the property and the owner has failed to take reasonable measures to remedy the harm; 
d.  A site identified by the federal Environmental Protection Agency as a superfund site pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Section 9601, et seq., or having environmental contamination to an extent that requires remedial investigation or a feasibility study;

2.  Is conducive to ill health, transmission of disease, infant mortality, or crime in the immediate proximity of the property. Property shall not be deemed blighted solely because of aesthetic conditions. 
"Building inspector" means a certified inspector possessing the requisite qualifications to determine minimal code compliance.

C.  Levy of increase ad valorem tax on blighted real property. There is hereby levied on all real property within the city which has been officially identified as maintained in a blighted condition an increased ad valorem tax by applying a factor of seven (7.0) to the millage rate applied to the property, so that such property shall be taxed at a higher millage rate generally applied in the municipality, or otherwise provided by general law; provided, however, real property on which there is situated a dwelling house which is being occupied as the primary residence of one or more persons shall not be subject to official identification as maintained in a blighted condition and shall not be subject to increased taxation. Such increased ad valorem tax shall be applied and reflected in the first tax bill rendered following official designation of a real property as blighted. 
Revenues arising from the increased rate of ad valorem taxation shall, upon receipt, be segregated by the city manager and used only for community redevelopment purposes, as identified in an approved urban redevelopment program, including defraying the cost of the city's program to close, repair, or demolish unfit building and structures.

1.  A property owner or person(s) who is chargeable with the payment of ad valorem taxes on real property which has been officially designated pursuant to this section as property maintained in a blighted condition may petition the public officer to lift the designation, upon proof of compliance with the following:

b.  Completion of work required under a court order entered in a proceeding brought pursuant to Chapter 8.24, Unfit Buildings, of Title 8 of the Code of Covington, Georgia. 
2.  Before action on a petition to lift the designation, the public officer shall cause the property to be thoroughly inspected by a building inspector who, by written inspection report, shall certify that all requisite work has been performed to applicable code in a workmanlike manner, in accordance with the specifications of the plan of remedial action or redevelopment, or applicable court order. Upon finding required work to be satisfactorily performed, the public officer shall issue a written determination that the real property is no longer maintained in a blighted condition. Copies of this determination shall be served upon the person(s) chargeable with the payment of ad valorem taxes, and upon the tax commissioner of Newton County. 
3.  All plans for remedial action or redevelopment shall be in writing, signed by the person(s) chargeable with the payment of ad valorem taxes on the real property and the director of the city's planning and development department, and contain the following: 
a.  The plan shall be consistent with the city's comprehensive plan and all laws and ordinances governing the subject property, and shall conform to any urban redevelopment plan adopted for the area within which the property lies;

1.  Real property which has had its designation as maintained in a blighted condition removed by the public officer, as provided in subsection D of this section, shall be eligible for a decrease in the rate of city ad valorem taxation by applying a factor of 0.5 to the city millage rate applied to the property, so that such property shall be taxed at a lower millage rate than the millage rate generally applied in the municipality or otherwise provided by general law; such decreased rate of taxation shall be applied beginning with the next tax bill rendered following removal of official designation of a real property as blighted. The decreased rate of taxation may be given in successive years, depending on the amount of cost expended by the person(s) chargeable with payment of ad valorem taxes on the property to satisfy its remediation or redevelopment, with every twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00) or portion thereof equaling one year of tax reduction; provided, however, that no property shall be entitled to reduction in city ad valorem taxes for more than four successive years. 
2.  In order to claim entitlement for a decreased rate of taxation, the person(s) chargeable with payment of ad valorem taxes on the property shall submit a notarized affidavit to the public officer, supported by receipts or other evidence of payment, of the amount expended.

2.  Certified copies of the licensee's state of Georgia Department of Revenue Sales and Use/Tax Monthly Reports as filed with Georgia Department of Revenue for each month during the applicable calendar quarter. 
B.  Any sale of a food or beverage containing any alcoholic beverage shall be deemed to be a sale solely of malt beverages, wine or distilled spirits as the case may be, and no such sale shall be included as food sales in the quarterly reports. The fact that the sale of food during any calendar quarter exceeds sales of alcoholic beverages shall not be conclusive on the issue of whether the licensee is meeting the requirements of operating a restaurant as herein defined; however, the failure of the food sales to exceed the sale of alcoholic beverages shall be prima facie evidence that the principal business of the licensee is not that of serving food as required to meet the definition of a restaurant. 
C.  Such quarterly statements shall be confidential in nature and shall not be open for public inspection except as may be required by Georgia law. Such forms shall be used solely by the city manager for determination of whether or not the licensee remains qualified to hold its retail license for sale of alcoholic beverages for on-premises consumption in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. Failure to timely file such statements shall be a violation of a city ordinance punishable in the manner provided in Section 1.12.010 of this code and a basis for the revocation of the license granted under this chapter. If, after appropriate notice and hearing, the judge of the city's municipal court finds that a licensee's violation of this section is not willful and the licensee otherwise meets the requirements of a restaurant as provided in this chapter, the judge shall have the option of imposing a probationary period on the licensee, not to exceed six months, and any further violations of this article shall be a basis for revocation of such license.

As used in this chapter, the term "cable television system" shall include the system composed of the within and foregoing items and all cable television services provided by the city through such system. The city shall operate its cable television system in accordance with the provisions of Sections 58(g) and 16A of the Charter of the City of Covington, Georgia (Georgia Laws 1962, page 2003, as amended) and in accordance with: 
1.  All applicable rules, regulations, procedures and policies of all governmental agencies; 
2.  All franchise agreements and ordinances between the city and any other local government within Newton county, Georgia; and 
3.  The provisions of this chapter. 
B.  The city contemplates operating its cable television system both within the corporate limits of the city as may now or hereafter exist as well as in areas of Newton County outside the corporate limits of the city; provided, however, anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the city shall not extend its cable television system for the purpose of supplying cable television services in any area of Newton County outside of the then-existing corporate limits of the city without first entering into a franchise agreement with the governing body of Newton County, Georgia, when such services are to be provided in the unincorporated areas of Newton County, Georgia, or with the governing body of any other municipality within Newton County when such services are to be provided in any such municipality. The city, upon approval by the mayor and council, shall be authorized to enter into franchise agreements with the governing bodies of Newton County and the various municipalities located within Newton County upon such terms and conditions as the mayor and council shall agree and as provided in such franchise agreements; provided, however, except as otherwise expressly provided in any such franchise agreements, the provisions of this chapter and all rules and regulations promulgated and adopted pursuant to the provisions hereof shall apply to the operation of Covington Cable Television within the city and throughout Newton County, Georgia. 
(Prior code § 22-102)

A.  For the purpose of determining installation and reconnection charges, subscriber rates and miscellaneous service charges, subscribers shall be divided into two separate subscriber classifications, to-wit:

2.  Home subscribers which shall mean all subscribers other than multiple-use subscribers. 
B.  The governing authority is authorized to establish from time to time by resolution, various classifications of cable television service. Initially, the service classifications shall be basic CATV service and expanded CATV service, and it is contemplated that expanded CATV service will be further divided into other sub classifications so that subscriber rates can be based on types of services received by the subscriber. 
C.  The governing authority shall from time to time, by resolution, establish the installation and reconnection charges for standard connections and subscriber rates for all subscribers and service classifications, which rates and charges shall remain in effect until modified by subsequent resolution of the governing authority.

D.  Different subscriber rates can be established for the different classifications of services and subscribers; provided, however, subscriber rates within the different classifications shall be uniform and shall not differentiate due to geographic location of the subscriber.

If the city's investigation or inspection identifies that any dwelling, building, structure or property is unfit for human habitation or for commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the city may issue a complaint in rem against the lot, tract, or parcel of real property on which such dwelling, building, or structure is situated or where such public health hazard or public nuisance exists and shall cause summons and a copy of the complaint to be served on the record property owner and any other person or entity having an interest in such dwelling, building or structure, as disclosed by examination of real property title records maintained in the office of the Clerk of Newton Superior Court.

B.  An inspection warrant shall be issued only for good cause shown and when supported by an affidavit particularly describing the place, dwelling, structure, or premises to be inspected and the purpose for which the inspection is to be made. In addition, the affidavit shall contain either a statement that consent to inspect has been sought and refused or facts or circumstances reasonably justifying the failure to seek such consent. Cause shall be deemed to exist if either reasonable legislative or administrative standards for conducting a routine or area inspection are satisfied with respect to the particular place, dwelling, structure or premises, or if there is reason to believe that a condition exists with respect to the particular place, dwelling, structure or premises rendering the same unfit as set forth in Section 8.24.010 of this chapter. 
C.  An inspection warrant shall be effective for the time specified therein, but not for a period of more than ten days next following the date of issuance, unless extended or renewed by the judicial officer who signed and issued the original warrant, upon satisfying himself that such extension or renewal is in the public interest.

An inspection pursuant to a warrant shall not be made by means of forcible entry, except that the judicial officer may expressly authorize a forcible entry where facts are shown which are sufficient to create a reasonable suspicion of the existence of a condition described in Section 8.24.050 of this chapter, which, if such condition existed, would be an immediate threat to health or safety of persons occupying or proximately affected by such place, dwelling, structure or premises. 
E.  The willful refusal of the tenant in possession or the owner of a place, dwelling, structure or premises subject to the issuance of an inspection warrant shall be a violation punishable in accordance with Section 1.12.010 of this code. 
F.  The foregoing provisions shall not be deemed to be in lieu of any other rights and privileges the city or the city housing inspector may have to insure compliance with this chapter, but the housing inspector or any other appropriate city official or any person who would be damaged by a violation of this chapter in addition to other remedies, may institute injunction, mandamus or other appropriate action or proceeding in any court of competent jurisdiction to compel compliance with this chapter or to abate any violations thereof, including the prohibiting of occupancy of any dwelling unit not in conformity with the minimum requirements of this chapter or Chapter 15.08 of the code.

(Ord. dated 11-19-12(1), § 1) 
13.04.110 - Meter reading and billing, dates payment due and delinquent, penalty and discontinuance of service for nonpayment—Reconnections—Responsibility of utility customer to provide adequate means for receipt of bill. 
A.  Meters shall be read at intervals of approximately one month and bills mailed as soon thereafter as is practicable. The charges which shall be for service up to the meter reading immediately preceding the mailing of the bill, shall be payable within twenty (20) days from the mailing of the bill. Should the charges for any utility service not be paid within twenty (20) days from the mailing of the bill, the same shall include a late fee in the amount of ten (10) percent of the amount originally billed. United States post office postmarks will be accepted as the payment date on receipts by mail. Whenever the final date of the net bill falls on a Sunday or legal holiday, the accrual of a ten (10) percent late fee shall be postponed one day. 
B.  Upon the thirty-fifth (35th) day from the mailing of the bill for utility service, if same shall remain unpaid, it shall be declared delinquent. As soon as practicable thereafter, service shall be discontinued. After service has been discontinued for nonpayment of a bill, such service shall not be reconnected until all arrears, in addition to a reconnect fee in the amount of thirty dollars ($30.00), have been paid. In the event the customer requests a service reconnection after normal business hours and service is reconnected after normal business hours, such service shall not be reconnected until an additional after-hours reconnect fee in the amount of thirty-five dollars ($35.00), has been paid. Any delinquent cutoff which is not reconnected within thirty (30) days from the date of cutoff shall be considered as a seasonal cutoff and any seasonal charges applicable shall be applied in addition to delinquent fees. 
C.  Anything herein contained to the contrary notwithstanding, a customer's utility service shall not be terminated for nonpayment, without the customer first having an opportunity for a fair hearing of any and all disputes or allegations that the customer may have concerning the propriety or accuracy of the charges by the city for such services. The city manager is designated as the representative of the city for the purpose of hearing and determining all disputes concerning the propriety of utility bills that a customer may question or dispute. A utility customer is entitled to a hearing of his allegations of impropriety or incorrectness of a billing by filing with the city manager (or his designee as hereinafter provided) at city hall a written notice of such dispute and the customer's evidence and contentions concerning same. Upon receipt of a written notice in accordance with the provisions of the foregoing sentence, the city manager or his designee shall apprise the customer in question that a hearing will be held on the customer's contentions on a date certain, at least three days subsequent to the date notice of such hearing is given to the customer involved, at which time the customer shall present all evidence and contentions concerning the billing involved. The city manager or his designee may extend the hearing as so set for cause shown. If the person hearing the customer's dispute determines that the customer's contentions are without merit, then the utility services of that customer may be terminated for nonpayment as hereinbefore provided and without further notice to the customer. Nothing contained in this paragraph shall require the city to reinstate utility services once same are terminated if the complaining customer does not file written notice of a disputed account with the city prior to the delinquency cut-off date specified in the immediately preceding paragraph. Further, nothing contained in this paragraph shall be deemed to prohibit the city manager's right to delegate his authority for the conducting of the hearings on disputed accounts under this section as such right of delegation may otherwise appear in the charter of the city. All utility bills for the city shall contain a notation to the effect that the city manager should be contacted at city hall concerning any disputed billings or charges and that otherwise, service will be disconnected and a reconnection fee charged if a utility bill is not paid within fifteen (15) days after due date of any unpaid billing. 
D.  It is the responsibility of each customer for utility services or any other city service including, but not limited to, garbage pickup and cable television service provided by the city to provide a correct mailing address and adequate means (whether by mail receptacle or delivery to an agent for the customer) to receive such bills mailed by the city to the customer via the United States Postal Service. The city shall have no responsibility to deliver such billings to a customer where the customer fails to provide an adequate mail receptacle or an appropriate mailing address to ensure the delivery of such billings from the city. Any city service billing that cannot be delivered by the United States Postal Service to the customer in whose name the bill appears (or their designated agent) which results in the city's having to make arrangements for personal delivery of a billing or notice of the billing to such customer, shall be subject to the imposition of a service fee of ten dollars ($10.00) for each such personal delivery of a bill or notice thereof. The aforesaid ten dollar ($10.00) service fee, if assessed by the city, shall be due at the same time and under the same circumstances as the bill for which the service fee applies. Nothing contained herein, however, shall be deemed to create an obligation on the city to require personal delivery of any service bill for services provided by the city that cannot otherwise be delivered by the United States Postal Service, but the city is expressly excused from such effort; however, if the city elects to provide personal delivery or notice of any service bill provided for hereunder to a customer, then the city may impose such ten dollar ($10.00) service fee to offset the cost of such personal delivery.

If it becomes necessary for the city to protect, move, or replace any equipment because of such work then the cost shall be charged to and paid by the person or contractor responsible.

13.04.170 - Penalty for violation of chapter provisions.

13.04.180 - Procedure for termination of utility services. 
Except as expressly provided in Section 13.04.110, no utility service of any customer shall be terminated by the city for any reason given in this title, except in accordance with the following provisions: 
When the city feels that it has just cause for the suspension or termination of any utility service to a customer, written notice shall be given to said customer by hand delivery to the customer or by United States first class mail to the address indicated in the files of the city for utility billing purposes. Said notice shall specify that the city intends to discontinue certain utility services to the person so notified, the services sought to be discontinued, the reason or reasons for discontinuing of such services, the date on which the city intends to discontinue such services, and shall notify the customer of the customer's opportunity for a fair hearing of any and all disputes or allegations that the customer may have concerning the propriety or accuracy of the reason or reasons for discontinuing such services. The city manager is designated as the representative of the city for the purpose of hearing and determining all disputes concerning the propriety of discontinuing of services that a customer may question or dispute. A utility customer is entitled to a hearing of his allegations of impropriety or incorrectness of discontinuing of such services by filing with the city manager (or his designee as hereinafter provided) at city hall a written notice of such dispute and the customer's evidence and contentions concerning same. Upon receipt of a written notice in accordance with the provisions of the foregoing sentence, the city manager or his designee shall apprise the customer in question that a hearing will be held on the customer's contentions on a date certain, at least three days subsequent to the date notice of such hearing is given to the customer involved, at which time the customer shall present all evidence and contentions concerning the customer's objection to the reason or reasons for discontinuing such services. The city manager or his designee may extend the hearing as so set for cause shown. If the person receiving notice of proposed suspension or termination of utility service, as specified in the preceding subparagraph, does not appear in person or by his designated agent at the hearing scheduled by the city for the purpose of determining whether or not a customer's utility service or services should be suspended or terminated, or if after such hearing is conducted, the person hearing the subject matter determines that the customer has violated the provisions of this title of the city or that the city otherwise has just cause for suspending or terminating the said customer's utility service or services, then and thereafter, the utility service or services of such customer shall be promptly suspended or terminated. Nothing contained in this paragraph shall require the city to reinstate utility services once same are terminated if the complaining customer does not file written notice of a dispute with the city prior to the date of intended discontinuation of service specified in the notice to the customer. Further, nothing contained in this paragraph shall be deemed to prohibit the city manager's right to delegate his authority for the conducting of the hearings under this section as such right of delegation may otherwise appear in the charter of the city.

(Prior code § 22-19) 
Chapter 13.08 - ELECTRIC SYSTEM 
Article 1 - Generally 

13.08.010 - Application for service—Terms of contract. 
Each person or corporation desiring to become a customer for electric service supplied by the city shall make application for service, either in person or by duly authorized agent, upon the city's regular forms. The application will not be accepted by the city unless all the conditions and provisions of this chapter are complied with. When the application is accepted by the city, it constitutes a contract and becomes operative on the day the customer is connected to the city's system. Unless otherwise specified, such contract is for the term of one year, and shall be considered renewed from term to term of like duration thereafter unless written notice to the contrary is given by either party to the other at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the contract or any renewal thereof. 
(Prior code § 22-21) 
13.08.020 - Rates, choice of—Responsibility of consumer, of city. 
A.  When two or more rates are available for certain classes of service, the conditions under which each is applicable to the requirements of the individual customer are plainly set forth in the city's published rate schedules. The choice of such rates lies with the customer. In the special case of multiple unit dwellings, standard practice requires that each separate unit be separately metered at the regular residential service rate. However, in those cases where the provision of a separately metered circuit to each separate dwelling unit is impracticable, all service may be supplied through a single meter at the multiple residential service rate. Combined service so rendered shall not be sub-metered to the individual tenant. The multiple residential rate is the only rate applicable to two or more separate dwelling units served through a single meter, except as otherwise provided under the general service rate. 
B.  The city will at any time upon request advise any customer as to the rate best adapted to existing or anticipated service requirements as defined by the customer, but the city does not assume responsibility for the selection of such rate or for the continuance of the lowest annual cost under the rate selected should the volume or character of service change. 
C.  A customer, having selected a rate adapted to his service, may not change to another rate within a twelve (12) month period unless there is a substantial change in the character or conditions of his service. A new customer will be given reasonable opportunity to determine his service requirements before definitely selecting the most favorable rate therefor. 
(Prior code § 22-22) 
13.08.030 - Exclusive right of service. 
A.  All electric current required or used for any purpose at any time during the term of the contract for service, or any renewal thereof, in or upon the customer's premises, and all extensions and enlargements thereof, shall be taken by the customer from the city, provided that the city is at the time able to supply the same, except only in those cases where special contracts are made for breakdown service or limited service under the rates prescribed for that particular type of service. 
B.  Electric service will not be supplied in competition with the city's service, either wholesale or retail, or for distribution or supply or resale in any territory occupied by the distribution system of the city or proposed to be occupied by the distribution system of the city. 
Such service as is supplied under the contract is for the customer's use within or upon his premises and for the purposes designated in the application. The customer shall not extend service from one location to another by crossing rights-of-way or public streets, roads, alleys or property owned by others. The customer shall not supply electrical energy to anyone else or allow anyone to take same, nor shall he use or permit same to be used at any other premises or for any other purposes (either directly or indirectly by transformation or regeneration) than those designated in the application. Where the customer's service requirements indicate that modification of the above rule is reasonable, then such modification may be made by the proper city official upon application. 
(Prior code § 22-23) 
13.08.040 - Enlarged facilities, change of location, cost. 
Increased service requirements shall be supplied, when practicable, through the existing service facilities. When enlarged service facilities are required, but no change in location is involved, the city will provide such facilities as required by the character of service and the applicable rate schedule, without cost to the customer up to three and one-half times the estimated new annual revenue to be received. When a change in location only is involved, the entire expense shall be borne by the party requesting such change. When both enlarged service facilities and change in location are involved, the costs shall be shared by the two parties as provided above. In all cases the customer shall make, at his own expense, all changes to his wiring, and provide those enclosures and metering connections on his premises that are required for the enlargement of, or change in the location of the metering equipment. The customer shall give reasonable advance notice to the city of additions of electrical equipment which affect the connected load under contract to the end that the city will have ample time to provide adequate service facilities. 
(Prior code § 22-24)

(Prior code § 22-34) 
Article 2 - Retail Distribution Line Extension and Service Connection Regulations 

13.08.150 - Definitions. 
For purposes of these regulations, an existing overhead retail distribution line is defined as any pole line carrying primary and/or secondary circuits of twenty-five thousand (25,000) volts or less, nominal rating, or a similar line operating at twenty-five thousand (25,000) volts or less, provided such line is not serving as a transmission or wholesale distribution line. A single phase line shall not be considered as an existing retail distribution line in the case of application for three phase service, but in such case "existing overhead retail distribution line" shall be interpreted to mean the nearest available three phase line which meets the above definition. Urban lines are defined as those lines lying within the corporate limits of communities having a population of one thousand (1,000) or more. Rural lines are defined as all lines not embraced within the above definition of urban lines. 
(Ord. dated 10/2/06 § 1; prior code § 22-37) 
13.08.160 - Installation of equipment—Extension of lines, cost. 
A.  Upon receipt and acceptance of the application for service as provided in Article 1 of this chapter, the city will proceed to do such work and to provide and install such equipment as it may be required to do in order to render the service, including the extension of an existing line when necessary, as determined by the location and character of the service and the terms of the rate schedule to be applied; but the city shall not be required to so expend three and one-half more times than the estimated annual revenue to be derived from the service. Should the net cost of the job exceed three and one-half times the estimated annual revenue, the service may nevertheless be provided (in most instances) upon contribution by the applicant of such excess. 
B.  Extensions from existing overhead retail distribution lines to supply new customers single phase service may be made upon a footage basis, if such basis is more advantageous to the applicant or applicants than the revenue ratio basis. Should such basis be elected, then the city will extend such line an average of four hundred (400) feet per equivalent customer, but not to exceed an average of one-thousand-fifty-six (1,056) feet per actual customer, exclusive of service cut-ins, and provide service without charge. Should the required extension exceed in length such free allowance, the extension may nevertheless be made (in most instances) upon contribution by the applicant or applicants of the pro rata part of the line cost of the job represented by such excess. 
(Prior code § 22-38) 
13.08.180 - Estimated revenue, determination of. 
Estimated revenues shall be determined on the basis of anticipated use by the particular customer involved and the existing applicable rate schedule. In no case will revenue be credited to a job or line extension from any customer who could be served without undertaking the job or making the extension. 
(Prior code § 22-40) 
13.08.190 - Cost, items of. 
Net cost of the job shall include all charges thereto for materials, labor and overheads, in furnishing and erecting poles, towers, cross arms and fixtures, stringing wire, making service connections, providing transformation and metering equipment, etc., in accordance with Section 13.08.160 less credits for salvage, if any. Line cost includes only those items pertaining to the line extension itself, omitting service connections, transformers and meters. 
(Prior code § 22-41) 
13.08.200 - Method of service, determination to be made by city. 
A.  Applications for service to a load drawing an inrush current in excess of the limits specified: (a) in the case of residential service, the residential rate schedule or (b) in the case of other classes of service, the booklet entitled "Electric Service and Metering Installations"; or applications for three phase service shall be given special consideration by the city to determine the most economical method of serving the load, taking into account the availability of supply lines, the nature and location of the load to be served and its effect upon service rendered to neighboring customers, the relative merits of providing single or three phase service, and other factors of weight in reaching a decision. Such decision shall rest solely with the city, but should the applicant desire service of a different type or rendered in a different manner, service may be so supplied, at the option of the city, provided the applicant contributes, in addition to his contribution toward receiving service (if any), the increased cost occasioned thereby. In any event, should three phases need to be supplied to a single motor of less than five HP, or to an aggregate motor load of less than fifteen (15) HP, it shall be contingent upon the applicant signing the three phase clause releasing the city from the obligation of providing three phase service for the same motor load at any other location. 
B.  Application for commercial power service requiring excessive capacity because of large momentary current requirements, or to provide unusually close voltage regulation (transformer type welders, X-ray machines, etc.) shall be given special consideration by the city to determine the most economical method of serving the load without causing objectionable voltage fluctuations. It may or may not be necessary to isolate such load from other services by providing a separate transformer and separate connection to the primary circuit, but the surcharge provided in the rate schedule shall apply whether or not such separate connection is actually made. Such surcharge covers the excess capacity required by the customer and in no case is to be determined by the equipment or capacity actually installed by the city at the time service of this type is initiated. 
(Prior code § 22-42) 
13.08.210 - Underground distribution system, cost of extension and for connection. 
Where the city can readily provide overhead electric service, but the applicant requests that underground service be provided instead the city can, subject to its evaluation and discretion, provide underground service in accordance with the following: 
A.  For subdivisions, condominiums, apartments or other multiple occupant developments, the applicant shall pay to the city the full estimated cost of underground facilities prior to the start of construction of such facilities. Where site conditions result in unforeseen additional cost to the city, the applicant shall reimburse the city for such additional cost. 
B.  For individual properties, not part of a subdivision, the applicant shall pay the city a charge equal to the cost of providing facilities at each end of the underground service line plus a per foot charge equal to the city's cost of the service line and its installation. 
C.  Privately owned secondary voltage service lines may be provided and maintained by the applicant at its expense and be terminated upon the city's pole or other facility, as designated by the city. 
D.  Where the city does not have overhead lines within four hundred (400) feet of the requested underground connection that could serve as the source of power for the underground system and additional overhead or underground lines of adequate capacity must be extended, the applicant shall be required to pay the city's cost of such extension. 
(Ord. dated 10/2/06 § 3) 
13.08.220 - Prerequisites to construction of extensions. 
The city shall not be required to begin construction on any extension of its retail distribution lines until signed service contracts have been obtained covering the business upon which the estimated revenue is based, nor until at least seventy-five (75) percent of the signed customers have either wired their premises to permit the utilization of the service contracted for or have executed bona fide contracts covering such wiring. 
(Prior code § 22-44) 
13.08.240 - Temporary service, regulation of. 
The foregoing extension and connection regulations do not apply to temporary service. Temporary service includes all classes of service required by the applicant for a single continuous period of less than one year. All extensions and connections for a temporary service shall be made in accordance with the following: 
A.  When temporary service is desired at premises which are already wired and connected to the retail distribution system, and the city has no expense in establishing service other than the installation of the necessary metering equipment, no connection charge will be made. 
B.  In case the provision of temporary service involves cost for labor and material other than the meter installation, the applicant shall pay in advance the total estimated cost of establishing and dismantling the service facilities, less salvage value of the material used. 
(Prior code § 22-46)

3.  Where a developer makes application for the extension of sewer mains to a proposed subdivision or development, the city engineering department shall estimate the cost of extending such service to the property line of the property to be developed; and this estimate shall be presented to the mayor and council. It shall be the policy of the city to extend sewer service to the property line of such property without cost to the developer, subject to the following terms and conditions, to wit: 
a.  Sewer service shall be extended to all lots within the subdivision at the expense of the developer (applicant), and the city shall take the necessary steps to assure that the developer performs this obligation before the city approves the extension of sewer service to the property line; and 
b.  The city reserves the right to refuse to extend such service to the property line of such property when the cost of such extension is determined by the mayor and council to be excessive, or when the city does not have funds available for such extension; and in either of such events, the developer and the city may negotiate such extension on such terms and conditions as the mayor and council may approve. 
4.  When a developer makes application for the extension of sewer mains to a proposed subdivision or development, and the mayor and council as hereinabove provided determine that the cost of such extension would be excessive, or the mayor and council determine that the city does not have the funds available for such extension, and the city and the developer are unable to satisfactorily negotiate the financing of such extension, the mayor and council shall, on request of the developer, certify these facts to the planning commission for its consideration in determining what utilities the developer will be required to provide in such proposed subdivision or development. 
C.  Sewer Extensions to Properties Served by Private Sewerage Disposal Systems. When the owner of any house, building or property used for human occupancy connected to a private sewage disposal system makes application for the extension of sewer mains to such property and such extension is expressly approved by the mayor and council, the actual cost to the city of such extension shall be assessed against the applicant. The actual cost to the city of such extension of the the city sewer line to the owner's property line and the applicable sewer tap fees may be paid by the owner to the city in installments together with monthly administrative fees as herinafter set forth. In the event the cost of such extension is two thousand four hundred dollars ($2,400.00) or less, the owner may pay the cost of such extension, together with the applicable sewer tap fees and administrative fees of three dollars ($3.00) per month, in twenty-four (24) equal monthly payments. In the event the cost of such extension is more that two thousand four hundred dollars ($2,400.00), the owner may pay the cost of such extension, together with the applicable sewer tap fees and administrative fees of three dollars ($3.00) per month, in thirty-six (36) equal monthly payments. The owner shall construct a sanitary sewer line from the owner's house to the property line, in accordance with these specifications, and shall bear all costs for the installation of same. 
(Ord. dated 4/20/15(1), § 10; Ord. dated 6/3/13(1), §§ 1, 2; Ord. dated 1/7/13, § 1; Ord. dated 7/19/10, § 2; Ord. dated 2/1/10, § 1; Ord. dated 6/2/08, § 2; Ord. dated 2/6/06, § 3; Ord. dated 6/20/05, §§ 1, 2; Ord. dated 7/9/03, § 2; Ord. dated 1/6/03, § 2; Ord. dated 6/5/00, § 2; Ord. dated 5/1/00, § 3; Ord. dated 12/20/99, § 1 (part); prior code § 22-80) 
13.16.041 - Nonresidential sewer tap fees. 
The fee for connection of nonresidential uses to the city sewer system shall be calculated based on a comparison of the expected sewage effluent of such use with effluent of typical single-family residence. No nonresidential tap fee will be less than that for residential use connections, as provided in Section 13.16.040 of this chapter. 
For comparison purposes, a residential use is expected to generate three hundred fifty (350) gallons per day of sewage and 0.73 pounds of five-day biochemical oxygen demand per unit. The tap fees for nonresidential use will be calculated by comparing their flow, based on: (1) the average daily water demands provided in Section 6.12(b) of the EPD document, "Minimum Standards for Public Water Systems," a copy of which shall be maintained for public inspection during normal business hours at the city engineering department; or (2) the best available water use records, with the flow expected from a residential use. The tap fee for dischargers of process waste will be calculated by comparing the strength of the waste with the strength of domestic waste. In the event that the waste is expected to include other parameters, such as suspended solids or ammonia, which are significantly higher than domestic waste, a comparison will be made of that parameter and will be used in calculating the connection fee. 
The tap fee for nonresidential service will be determined by the best information available to the city. Any discharger of process waste into the city sewer system will be responsible for furnishing periodic estimates of the quantity and component analysis of the waste to be discharged. The tap fee for dischargers of process waste will be subject to an adjustment if the city determines that the fee was calculated on the basis of inaccurate data. Dischargers of process waste will be responsible for the cost of the number of tests determined by the city to be sufficient to accurately calculate the average strength of such discharge. 
(Ord. dated 6/2/08, § 3; Ord. dated 6/20/05, § 3) 
13.16.050 - Water cut off when sewer charge not paid. 
It is determined and declared that it would be impractical and dangerous to the public health for the city to continue to furnish water to a customer and at the same time to decline to dispose of his sewage; therefore, where the sewerage customer is also a water customer, the failure of such customer to pay such fees and charges on or before the twenty-fifth day of each month following their billing on the first of the month shall authorize the city to cut off the water supply of such customer in the same manner that water is cut off for failure to pay water bills. 
(Ord. dated 12/20/99, § 1 (part); prior code § 22-81) 
13.16.060 - Deposit for water service to secure payment of sewerage fees. 
All deposits made as security for the payments of water bills shall in the same manner secure and be liable for payment of the sewerage fees and charges herein provided. 
(Ord. dated 12/20/99, § 1 (part); prior code § 22-82) 
13.16.070 - Maintenance of pipes connected to sewer. 
Each and every customer, wherever residing and however defined herein, is hereby required to maintain and keep clean the sewer pipes leading and connecting from his plumbing system to the city street line or city sewer main whichever is nearer.

Such waste shall not violate Section 13.24.020 or any other requirements established by the city. The superintendent may require septic tank waste haulers to obtain wastewater discharge permits. 
2.  The superintendent shall require haulers of industrial waste to obtain wastewater discharge permits. The superintendent may require generators of hauled industrial waste to obtain wastewater discharge permits. The superintendent also may prohibit the disposal of hauled industrial waste. The discharge of hauled industrial waste is subject to all other requirements of this chapter. 
3.  Industrial waste haulers may discharge loads only at locations designated by the superintendent. No load may be discharged without prior consent of the superintendent. The superintendent may collect samples of each hauled load to ensure compliance with applicable standards. The superintendent may require the industrial waste hauler to provide a waste analysis of any load prior to discharge. 
4.  Industrial waste haulers must provide a waste-tracking form for every load. This form shall include, at a minimum, the name and address of the industrial waste hauler, permit number, truck identification, names and addresses of sources of waste, and volume and characteristics of waste. The form shall identify the type of industry, known or suspected waste constituents, and whether any wastes are RCRA hazardous wastes.

e.  Measurement of Pollutants. 
i.  The categorical treatment standards applicable to each regulated process. 
ii.  The results of sampling and analysis identifying the nature and concentration, and/or mass, where required by the standard or by the superintendent, of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process. Instantaneous, daily maximum, and long-term average concentrations, or mass, where required, shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of daily operations and shall be analyzed in accordance with procedures set out in subsection J of this section. 
iii.  Sampling must be performed in accordance with procedures set out in subsection K of this section. 
f.  Certification. A statement, reviewed by the user's authorized representative and certified by a qualified professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not, whether additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or additional pretreatment is required to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements. 
g.  Compliance Schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or operation and maintenance will be required to meet the pretreatment standards, the shortest schedule by which the user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or operation and maintenance. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment standard. A compliance schedule pursuant to this section must meet the requirements set out in subsection B of this section. 
h.  Signature and Certification. All baseline monitoring reports must be signed and certified in accordance with Section 13.24.040(E) of this chapter. 
B.  Compliance Schedule Progress Reports. The following conditions shall apply to the compliance schedule required by subsection (A)(2) of this section: 
1.  The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the applicable pretreatment standards (such events include, but are not limited to, hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts for major components, commencing and completing construction, and beginning and conducting routine operation); 
2.  No increment referred to above shall exceed nine months; 
3.  The user shall submit a progress report to the superintendent no later than fourteen (14) days following each date in the schedule and the final date of compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate, the steps being taken by the user to return to the established schedule; and 
4.  In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress reports to the superintendent. 
C.  Reports on Compliance with Categorical Pretreatment Standard Deadline. 
Within ninety (90) days following the date for final compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any user subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the superintendent a report containing the information described in subsection (A)(2)(d) through (f) of this section. For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR 403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long-term production rate. For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with Section 13.24.040(E) of this chapter. 
D.  Periodic Compliance Reports. 
1.  All significant industrial users shall, at a frequency determined by the superintendent but in no case less than twice per year (in June and December), submit a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with Section 13.24.040(E) of this chapter. 
2.  All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
3.  If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the superintendent, using the procedures prescribed in subsection K of this section, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report. 
E.  Reports of Changed Conditions. Each user must notify the superintendent of any planned significant changes to the user's operations or system which might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater at least sixty (60) days before the change. 
1.  The superintendent may require the user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under Section 13.24.040(F) of this chapter. 
2.  The superintendent may issue a wastewater discharge permit under Section 13.24.050(E) of this chapter or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under Section 13.24.050(D) of this chapter in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions. 
3.  For purposes of this requirement, significant changes include, but are not limited to, flow increases of twenty (20) percent or greater, and the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants. 
F.  Reports of Potential Problems. 
1.  In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch discharge, or a slug load, that may cause potential problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the superintendent of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user. 
2.  Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless waived by the superintendent, submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this code. 
3.  A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a discharge described in subsection (F)(1) of this section. Employers shall ensure that all employees, who may cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the emergency notification procedure. 
G.  Reports From Unpermitted Users. All users not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the superintendent as the superintendent may require. 
H.  Notice of Violation-Repeat Sampling and Reporting. If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the superintendent within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the superintendent within thirty (30) days after becoming aware of the violation. 
I.  Notification of the Discharge of Hazardous Waste. 
1.  Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). lf the user discharges more than one hundred (100) kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the waste stream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste stream expected to be discharged during the following twelve (12) months. All notifications must take place no later than one hundred eighty (180) days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this paragraph need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under subsection E of this section. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of this section. 
2.  Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of subsection (I)(1) of this section during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than fifteen (15) kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than fifteen (15) kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
3.  In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste of listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the superintendent, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within ninety (90) days of the effective date of such regulations. 
4.  In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
5.  This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this code, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law. 
J.  Analytical Requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by EPA. 
K.  Sample Collection. 
1.  Except as indicated in subsection (K)(2) of this section, the user must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the superintendent may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits. 
2.  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, hexavalent chromium, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. 
L.  Timing. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern. 
M.  Record Keeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this code shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this code and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or the city, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the superintendent. 
(Prior code § 22-131) 
13.24.070 - Compliance monitoring. 
A.  Right of Entry: Inspection and Sampling. The superintendent shall have the right to enter the premises of any user to determine whether the user is complying with all requirements of this article and any wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder. Users shall allow the superintendent ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties. 
1.  Where a user has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, the superintendent will be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities. 
2.  The superintendent shall have the right to set up on the user's property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's operations. 
3.  The superintendent may require the user to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated according to the manufacturer's recommendations to ensure their accuracy. 
4.  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user at the written or verbal request of the superintendent and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be born by the user. 
5.  Unreasonable delays in allowing the superintendent access to the user's premises shall be a violation of this chapter. 
B.  Search Warrants. If the superintendent has been refused access to a building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this chapter or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program of the city designed to verify compliance with this article or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the superintendent may seek issuance of a search warrant from the Newton County Superior Court. 
(Prior code § 22-132) 
13.24.080 - Confidential information. 
Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits, and monitoring programs, and from the superintendent's inspection and sampling activities, shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the superintendent, that the release of such information would divulge information, processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable state or federal law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information or data. When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. wastewater constituents and characteristics and other effluent data as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the public without restriction. 
(Prior code § 22-133) 
13.24.090 - Publication of users in significant noncompliance. 
The superintendent shall publish annually, in the largest daily newspaper published in the municipality where the POTW is located, a list of the users which, during the previous twelve (12) months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. The term significant noncompliance shall mean: 
A.  Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which sixty-six (66) percent or more of wastewater measurements taken during a six-month period exceed the daily maximum limit or average limit for the same pollutant parameter by any amount; 
B.  Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which thirty-three (33) percent or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant parameter during a six-month period equals or exceeds the product of the daily maximum limit or the average limit multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH); 
C.  Any other discharge violation that the superintendent believes has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through, including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public; 
D.  Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment to the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the superintendent's exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge; 
E.  Failure to meet, within ninety (90) days of the scheduled date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance; 
F.  Failure to provide within thirty (30) days after the due date, any required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules; 
G.  Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or 
H.  Any other violation(s) which the superintendent determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program. 
(Prior code § 22-134) 
13.24.100 - Administrative enforcement remedies. 
A.  Notification of Violation. When the pretreatment coordinator finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this code, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the pretreatment coordinator may serve upon that user a written notice of violation. Within ten (10) days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the pretreatment coordinator. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the superintendent to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without a notice of violation first being issued. 
B.  Consent Orders. The superintendent may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. 
C.  Show Cause Hearing. The superintendent may order a user which has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this code, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the superintendent and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served on the user personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
D.  Compliance Orders. When the superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this code, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the superintendent may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
E.  Cease and Desist Orders. When the superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this code, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the superintendent may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to: 
1.  Immediately comply with all requirements; and 
2.  Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. 
Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
F.  Administrative Fines. 
1.  When the superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this code, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the superintendent may fine such user in an amount not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). Such fines shall be assessed on a per violation, per day basis. In the case of monthly or other long term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation. 
2.  Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after thirty (30) calendar days, be assessed an additional penalty of five percent of the unpaid balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of one percent per month. The city shall have a lien against the user's property for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties levied hereunder. 
3.  Any user aggrieved by the superintendent's imposition of such fine shall have the right to appeal said imposition to the city manager of the city. Such appeals shall be in writing and served on the city manager along with written notice thereof served on the superintendent within thirty (30) days of receipt by the user of notification of the fine. On appeal the city manager shall review de novo all records or other information pertaining to the imposition of such fine and, upon the request of the superintendent or the aggrieved user or upon his own motion, shall convene a hearing for the purpose of taking testimony relating to the facts and circumstances pertinent to the imposition of such fine. The city manager shall be empowered to modify or rescind such fine, and shall provide written notice of his decision to all parties to such appeal within forty-five (45) days from his receipt thereof. 
4.  Any user aggrieved by the city manager's decision upon such appeal shall have the right to appeal the same to the Superior Court of Newton County, Georgia. Any such appeal shall be filed within thirty (30) days of the city manager's decision, and upon failure to timely file the same the city manager's decision shall be final. The procedure for such appeals shall be as provided for other administrative appeals as set forth in Section 50-13-19, Official Code of Georgia Annotated. 
5.  Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
G.  Emergency Suspensions The city manager may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The city manager may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment. 
1.  Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the city manager may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The city manager may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the city manager that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in subsection H of this section are initiated against the user. 
2.  A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the superintendent prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under subsections C or G of this section. 
Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section. 
H.  Termination of Discharge. In addition to the provisions in Section 13.24.050(F) of this chapter, any user who violates the following conditions is subject to discharge termination: 
1.  Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions; 
2.  Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge; 
3.  Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge; 
4.  Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or 
5.  Violation of the pretreatment standards in Section 13.24.020 of this chapter. 
Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under subsection C of this section why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the city manager shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(Prior code § 22-135) 
13.24.110 - Judicial enforcement remedies. 
Injunctive Relief. When the city manager finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this code, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city manager may petition the Newton County Superior Court, through the city's attorney, for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this code on activities of the user. The city manager may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. 
B.  Civil Penalties. 
1.  A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this code, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the city for a maximum civil penalty of $1,000.00 per violation, per day. In the case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation. 
2.  The superintendent may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the city. 
3.  In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice requires. 
4.  Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. 
C.  Criminal Prosecution. 
1.  A user who willfully or negligently violates any provision of this code, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall, upon conviction, be subject to punishment as provided in Section 1.12.010 of this code. 
2.  A user who willfully or negligently introduces any substance into the POTW which causes personal injury or property damage shall, upon conviction, be subject to punishment as provided in Section 1.12.010 of this code. This penalty shall be in addition to any other cause of action for personal injury or property damage available under state or federal law. 
3.  A user who knowingly makes any false statements, representations, or certifications in any application, record, report, plan, or other documentation filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this code, wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this code shall, upon conviction, be subject to punishment as provided in Section 1.12.010 of this code. 
D.  Remedies Nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in this code are not exclusive. The superintendent may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the city's enforcement response plan. However, the superintendent may take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the superintendent is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user. 
(Prior code § 22-136) 
13.24.120 - Supplemental enforcement action. 
A.  Water Supply Severance. Whenever a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this code, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, water service to the user may be severed. Service will only recommence, at the user's expense, after it has satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply. 
B.  Public Nuisances. A violation of any provision of this code, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement is hereby declared a public nuisance and shall be corrected or abated as directed by the superintendent. Any person creating a public nuisance shall be subject to the provisions of Chapter 8.12 of this code governing such nuisances, including reimbursing the city for any costs incurred in removing, abating, or remedying said nuisance. 
(Prior code § 22-137) 
13.24.130 - Bypass. 
A.  For the purposes of this section: 
1.  "Bypass" means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a user's treatment facility. 
2.  "Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
B.  A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsections C and D of this section. 
C.  1.  If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the superintendent, at least ten (10) days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
2.  A user shall submit oral notice to the superintendent of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within twenty-four (24) hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The Superintendent may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within twenty-four (24) hours. 
D.  1.  Bypass is prohibited, and the superintendent may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless 
a.  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
b.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
c.  The user submitted notices as required under subsection C of this section. 
2.  The superintendent may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the superintendent determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (D)(1) of this section. 
(Prior code § 22-138) 
13.24.140 - Miscellaneous provisions. 
A.  Pretreatment Charges and Fees. The city may adopt reasonable fees for reimbursement of costs of setting up and operating the city's pretreatment program which may include: 
1.  Fees for wastewater discharge permit applications including the cost of processing such applications; 
2.  Fees for monitoring, inspection, and surveillance procedures including the cost of collection and analyzing a user's discharge, and reviewing monitoring reports submitted by users; 
3.  Fees for reviewing and responding to accidental discharge procedures and construction; 
4.  Fees for filing appeals; and 
5.  Other fees as the city may deem necessary to carry out the requirements contained in this section. These fees relate solely to the matters covered by this code and are separate from all other fees, fines, and penalties chargeable by the city. 
B.  Conflict and Precedence. This chapter industrial wastewater discharge permits, and federal pretreatment standards are complementary, and what is called for by one is as binding as if called for by all. In the event there are conflicts in the three documents, the documents shall take precedence in the following order: 
1.  Industrial wastewater discharge permit;

Chapter 13.32 - WATER CONSERVATION AND USE REGULATIONS 

13.32.010 - General provisions. 
A.  Purpose and Policy. This chapter sets forth the manner in which the city of Covington (hereinafter called "city") has established a general water conservation plan and water usage emergency regulations to assist in the proper and orderly distribution of the available potable water supplies to the city's water customers including its wholesale customers who purchase such water for distribution. The mayor and council recognize that both raw and treated water resources are limited valuable natural resources that should be conserved at all times so as to better ensure adequate water supplies for all citizens and residents of the city of Covington and Newton County, Georgia, and the state of Georgia. Conditions and situations may arise whereby it is possible, probable or certain that the city does not or will not have sufficient water resources to meet the demands of consumers connected to the city's water system, and accordingly this article is intended to provide a means by which consumption of the water resources may be reduced, curtailed or completely eliminated if appropriate due to such conditions. 
B.  Applicability. The provisions of this chapter are applicable to all persons or other legal entities who are connected to and receive treated water from the city's water distribution system, whether same is for human consumption, providing sprinkling and fire protection, used or useful in commercial or manufacturing processes, and whether at the retail or wholesale rate structure. These provisions apply to such consumers either inside or outside the municipal limits of the city and expressly include the city's wholesale purchasers who purchase water for redistribution, namely the town of Oxford and the Newton County Water and Sewerage Authority. 
(Prior code § 22-220) 
13.32.020 - Establishment of use priorities. 
A.  Any condition which causes the normal supply of water and pressure to be reduced excessively within the city's water distribution system requires that priority use of water be implemented. These conditions include any one or more of the following, as well as any other condition which actually causes a reduction in the available water supply and/or water pressure: 
1.  High water demand; 
2.  Drought and excessive heat conditions; 
3.  Supply interruptions; 
4.  Power failure; 
5.  Water main breakage or failures; and 
6.  State-imposed emergency conditions. 
B.  A general ranking of water uses in decreasing order of importance in the event of an emergency condition will be as follows: 
1.  Household use; 
2.  Public necessity as may be established from time to time by written declaration of: 
a.  The mayor and council; or 
b.  The city's water conservation board; 
3.  The watering and maintenance of livestock; 
4.  Industrial and commercial use; 
5.  Construction; 
6.  Irrigation including watering of lawns, shrubs and gardens; 
7.  Nonessential firefighting; 
8.  Filling and usage in swimming pools; 
9.  Carwashing; 
10.  Street cleaning, line flushing, hydrant testing and similar uses. 
C.  The city, by the adoption of this article, does hereby establish an emergency conservation plan as outlined in this chapter which will place restrictions on lower priority water usage during periods when water use reduction is necessary. 
(Prior code § 22-221) 
13.32.030 - States of water system operational status. 
A.  For the purposes of this chapter and implementation of the city's water conservation plan and emergency use regulations, there shall be five states of operational status identified as: 
1.  Normal operational status; 
2.  Minor water emergency; 
3.  Moderate water emergency; 
4.  Severe water emergency; and 
5.  Critical water emergency. 
B.  The actual state of operational status of the city's water system shall always be deemed to be the normal operational status until it is determined by either the water conservation board or the mayor and council of the city that such conditions exist that dictate a reduction in water consumption and they declare one of the four emergency stages of operational status of the system in accordance with the provisions of the next section of the code. 
(Prior code § 22-222) 
13.32.040 - Determination of states of operational status. 
As provided in Section 13.32.030, the city's water system shall be deemed to be in normal operational status unless and until a majority of the city's water conservation board or the city council at an official meeting thereof declares by written declaration a different operational status. The city's water conservation council may at any time declare one of the four water emergency states for implementation of the other provisions of this chapter and any rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to this chapter when a majority of the three members of the water conservation board determines that such conditions exist that warrant the declaration of a water emergency status. Upon such written declaration by the water conservation board, same shall remain in full force and effect until rescinded by it or until revoked by the city council in a duly called and held meeting of the mayor and council. 
(Prior code § 22-223) 
13.32.050 - Minor water emergency status. 
When a minor water emergency status has been declared within the city, the city shall implement the following priority conservation methods in an effort to achieve a minimum ten (10) percent reduction in water consumption. Public service announcements will be made on local radio stations, the cable television information channel, and in local newspapers requesting that customers curtail the use of any unnecessary water. The primary efforts of a minor water emergency condition will be aimed at limiting the practice of watering lawns, gardens, washing of cars and other practices that are not essential during emergency conditions. All fire departments and other governmental agencies will be asked to curtail water main flushing, dust control and other nonessential use of water. Such requests will be made by the city manager, the mayor, the members of the city council, the public works superintendent, the water works superintendent, and other municipal employees. Compliance with water consumption reduction under minor water emergency conditions shall be voluntary. 
(Prior code § 22-224) 
13.32.060 - Moderate water emergency status. 
A moderate water emergency status exists when there is a need to achieve an eleven (11) to twenty (20) percent reduction in water consumption. When a moderate emergency status is declared, in addition to the steps normally taken in a minor water emergency status, the following additional steps shall be taken: The immediate intensity or degree of announcements on local radio stations, cable television information channel and the newspaper media will be increased along with news releases by the city manager and mayor explaining the degree of severity of the problem; representatives of the governing body including the city manager and the mayor will make a stronger appeal for voluntary reduction of water usage; and city crews and public safety officials will be asked to actually field monitor water usage. If customers are observed using water for nonessential purposes, they will be contacted on-sight and asked to curtail water usage. After two requests are made, if the customer fails to comply, the customer's water service will be cut off at the meter and a reconnection fee will be charged to return the customer to service. 
(Prior code § 22-225) 
13.32.070 - Severe water emergency status. 
A severe water emergency status shall be declared when there is a need to reduce water consumption from twenty-one (21) to thirty (30) percent. Upon the declaration of a severe water emergency status, the mayor and the city manager will continue water conservation measures followed in the minor and moderate water emergency states. In addition, water system customers using more than one thousand (1,000) gallons per day will be directly notified of the water shortage and asked to provide assistance in alleviating the problem. As may be stated in the declaration, a more severe ban on water usage will be required and prohibition of all public water usage not required for health and safety will be enacted. No outside water usage will be permitted except that absolutely essential for public health and safety. No water-cooled air conditioners will be allowed to run without recirculation and businesses such as car washes and laundromats will be asked to curtail operations for limited periods. High water using industries will be asked to curtail operations if they operate more than one shift. Any person or entity ignoring water use warnings during a severe water emergency shall have their water service immediately disconnected after failure to heed the first warning for water conservation. Any service so disconnected shall not be reconnected until a reconnection fee of one and one-half percent of the normal reconnection fee is paid by the customer. 
(Prior code § 22-226) 
13.32.080 - Critical water emergency status. 
A critical water emergency status shall be declared whenever there is a need to curtail water consumption by more than thirty (30) percent. When a critical water emergency status has been declared, the measures implemented for a severe water emergency status will be continued along with additional measures concerning information and curtailment as may be appropriate. Prohibitions shall be declared by the mayor and council or the water conservation council on the use of any water for outside activities not essential or required for health and safety. Any business that uses in excess of one thousand (1,000) gallons per day may be required to curtail operations for limited periods until the critical water emergency has subsided. Residential water customers may be asked to wash clothes and use water for bathing every other day based on an alphabetical system as may be determined by the water conservation council. Personnel of the city including the city police department will be asked to monitor unnecessary use of water. Anyone found violating the curtailments implemented under the critical water emergency status shall have their water service terminated at the meter and same shall not be reconnected until a reconnection fee of two hundred (200) percent of the standard water service reconnection fee has been paid. Persons accused of violating critical water emergency curtailments shall be issued a citation to recorder's court for violation of municipal ordinance, namely violation of the city's water conservation ordinance and regulations. Upon the city recorder's finding of a knowing violation of this chapter by a person so cited, he or she shall be fined by the recorder for municipal ordinance violation in accordance with the provisions of Section 1.12.010 of this code. 
(Prior code § 22-227) 
13.32.090 - Subsequent offenders of water conservation ordinance and regulations. 
Any person or other legal entity whose water service is disconnected for violation of the provisions of this chapter and who either reconnects their water service without paying the appropriate reconnection fee or again violates the water curtailments in effect within thirty (30) days from reconnection shall be deemed to be a repeat offender and shall have their water meter removed and same shall not be reinstalled until the customer in question pays both a water tap fee and water service reconnection fee. Where appropriate, criminal charges shall be instituted against the person or entity responsible for the illegal reconnection for theft of services. 
(Prior code § 22-228) 
13.32.100 - Creation of water conservation board and powers. 
A.  There is created and established the city of Covington water conservation board consisting of three members who shall be mayor, the city manager, and the public works superintendent. In the event of a vacancy in the mayor's office, the mayor pro tem shall serve as a member of said board and in the event of any other vacancy on said board, the mayor (or mayor pro tem) shall appoint a member of the city council to serve until a city manager or public works superintendent is duly appointed. It shall be the responsibility of the water conservation board to monitor from time to time the status of the city's water supply and water distribution system. They shall report from time to time to the mayor and council their findings and recommendations concerning water conservation policies and the prospects of water emergencies. 
B.  Action by the water conservation board may be conducted from time to time with or without official meeting of all the board members as long as the action taken pursuant to this chapter is done by a majority of members of the board. All action in the way of declarations of emergency status and implementation of curtailments, procedures and regulations shall be in writing and shall promptly be filed with the city clerk and a copy posted on the bulletin board at City Hall. The board shall consult with the state environmental protection division water resources section concerning possible water emergencies as well as the city's consulting engineers concerning same and the making of recommendations to the mayor and council and the declaration of possible emergency situations. 
C.  The water conservation board is expressly authorized to adopt reasonable rules and regulations to carry out the effect and intent of this chapter so as to ensure that the city's available water resources are fairly allocated to its customers and used in accordance with the priorities established under Section 13.32.020 of this chapter. Any action by the water conservation board including rules and regulations promulgated by it shall be effective immediately upon their implementation in writing signed by two members of the board, filed with the city clerk and posted on the bulletin board at City Hall. The board and/or the city clerk shall ensure public dissemination of emergency declarations and the promulgation of rules and regulations adopted by the board. 
D.  Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, upon the adoption of any declaration, rules or regulations by the water conservation board, same shall remain in full force and effect until revoked, repealed or amended by the board or until revoked, repealed or amended by the mayor and council of the city in action at a duly called council meeting. 
(Prior code § 22-229) 
13.32.110 - Water reconnection fees. 
Any customer of the city's water distribution system whose water service is disconnected at the meter due to a violation of the provisions of this article shall be assessed a water reconnection fee equal to not less than one hundred ten (110) percent of the projected administrative expense incurred by the city in disconnecting and reconnecting such water service. The actual amount of the fee shall be set by declaration of the mayor and council or by the water conservation board from time to time and until changed by written declaration by the mayor and council or the water conservation board, the basic water reconnection fee shall be two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00). 
(Prior code § 22-230) 
13.32.120 - Violations of this chapter. 
In addition to any and all other rights that the city may exercise due to water system customer violations of the provisions of this chapter and the regulations and rules promulgated pursuant hereto, any person violating the provisions of this chapter and the rules and regulations promulgated hereunder shall be guilty of the violation of a municipal ordinance and may be cited for such violation and tried and fined in recorder's court in accordance with the provisions of Section 1.12.010 of this code. 
(Prior code § 22-231) 
13.32.130 - Application to wholesale customers. 
The Newton County water and sewage authority. the town of Oxford and any subsequent wholesale customer purchasing water from the city shall be provided with a copy of this chapter and rules and regulations promulgated pursuant hereto. Each such customer shall be required to implement similar ordinances, rules and regulations to ensure that its respective customers exercise water conservation measures and adhere to the policies and procedures specified herein during various states of water emergency. Each such wholesale customer is expected to curtail its use of water purchased from the city by the same percentage sought to be curtailed by the city for its own retail customers. Upon the failure of any wholesale customer to so effectuate a curtailment via reduction of distribution of water to its retail customers, the city shall, to the degree necessary, discontinue on such temporary basis during each day at the various meter points connecting such wholesale customers' systems and lines to the city's distribution system as will result in percentage curtailment desired to be achieved by the city. Such unilateral action by the city shall be done as a last resort after determination by the mayor and council or the water conservation board that a wholesale customer is failing to take such action as is necessary to curtail water consumption by its customers. It is the intention of the mayor and council that the city's wholesale customers shall share prorating in the reduction of water consumption with the city's retail customers. The city manager and other city employees are authorized to take such action as is necessary to ensure such curtailments in the event of the declaration of a water emergency. 
(Prior code § 22-232)

Subject to applicable federal regulations at the conclusion of service, a franchisee shall have the right to remove all cable and equipment, and a franchisee shall not be denied access to the premises to effectuate such removal. 
E.  Area Served. Unless otherwise provided in a franchise agreement, a franchisee shall build its cable system so that it is able to provide cable service to all residential dwellings located within its franchise area in accordance with the line extension requirements in subsection F below. 
F.  Line Extension Requirements. 
1.  Density Requirements. Unless otherwise provided in a franchise agreement, a franchisee shall extend its trunk and distribution system to serve subscribers requesting cable service after the date hereof at no charge where the density of potential subscribers to be passed by such extension is equal to or greater than twenty (20) potential subscribers per mile measured from the nearest point of the franchisee's nearest trunk amplifier. 
2.  Cost Sharing. 
a.  In the event that the requirements set forth in subsection (F)(1) of this section are not met, a franchisee must, upon the request of a potential subscriber or subscribers, extend its cable system based upon the following cost-sharing formula. The franchisee shall contribute an amount equal to the construction costs per quarter mile multiplied by the length of the extension in quarter miles, multiplied by a fraction where the numerator equals the number of actual potential subscribers per quarter mile at the time of the request and whose denominator equals four. Persons requesting service will be required to bear the remainder of the total construction costs on a pro rata basis. 
b.  As used in subsection (F)(2) of this section, "construction costs" are defined as the actual turnkey cost to construct the entire extension, including electronics, pole make-ready charges, and labor, but not the cost of the house drop. This provision applies to subdivisions and businesses as well as residences. Any amount contributed by a person requesting extension must be returned on the following basis: At the end of each calendar year, the franchisee must calculate the amount any contributing person would have paid had the extension been made at that time and pay back the difference between the amount actually collected from that person and the amount which would then be owed. 
c.  Installation of Service Drops. Except as federal regulations may otherwise allow, the franchisee shall not assess any additional cost beyond its standard installation charge for service drops of one hundred twenty-five (125) aerial feet (or seventy-five (75) underground feet) or less, unless the franchisee demonstrates to the city's satisfaction that extraordinary circumstances justify a higher charge. Where a drop exceeds one hundred twenty-five (125) aerial (or seventy-five (75) underground) feet in length, a franchisee may charge the subscriber for the difference between franchisee's actual costs associated with installing a one hundred twenty-five (125) foot aerial (or seventy-five (75) foot underground) drop, and the franchisee's actual cost of installing the longer drop, provided that drop length shall be the shorter of: (1) the actual length of installed drop, or (2) shortest distance to the point where the franchisee would be required to extend its distribution system. 
3.  Location of Drops. Except as federal regulations may otherwise allow, in any area where a franchisee would be entitled to install a drop above-ground, the franchisee will provide the homeowner the option to have the drop installed underground, but may charge the homeowner the difference between the actual cost of the above-ground installation and the actual cost of the underground installation. 
4.  Time for Extension. A franchisee must extend service to any person who requests it: (1) within seven working days of the request, where service can be provided by activating or installing a drop; (2) within thirty (30) days of the request in any area otherwise meeting the requirements of subsection (F)(1) of this section, or where an extension of one-half mile or less is required; or (3) within six months where an extension of one-half mile or more is required. 
G.  Inspections During Construction. The city may conduct inspections of construction areas and subscriber installations. The franchisee shall be notified of any violations found during the course of inspections. The franchisee must bring violations into compliance within thirty (30) days of the date notice of violation is given, and must submit a report to the city describing the steps taken to bring itself into compliance. Inspection does not relieve the franchisee of its obligation to build in compliance with all provisions of the franchise. 
H.  Use of Public Property. 
1.  Should the grades or lines of the public rights-of-way that a franchisee is authorized to use and occupy be changed at any time during the term of the franchise, the franchisee shall, if necessary, at its own cost and expense, relocate or change its cable system so as to conform with the new grades or lines. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if public funds are available, franchisee will be reimbursed in the same manner as other utilities. 
2.  Any alteration to the water mains, sewerage or drainage system or to any city, state or other public structures in the public rights-of-way required on account of the presence of the cable system in the public rights-of-way shall be made at the sole cost and expense of the franchisee. During any work of constructing, operating or maintaining of the cable system, the franchisee shall also, at its own cost and expense, protect any and all existing structures belonging to the city or any other person. All work performed by the franchisee pursuant to this section shall be done in the manner prescribed by the city or other officials having jurisdiction therein. 
I.  Publicizing Proposed Construction Work. A franchisee shall publicize proposed construction work at least one week prior to commencement of that work by causing written notice of such construction work to be delivered to the city and by notifying those persons most likely to be affected by the work in any manner reasonably calculated to provide adequate notice. In addition, before entering onto any person's property, a franchisee shall use its best efforts to contact the property owner or (in the case of residential property) the resident at least three days in advance. 
J.  System Maintenance. 
1.  Interruptions to be Minimized. A franchisee shall schedule maintenance so that activities likely to result in an interruption of cable service are performed during periods of minimum subscriber use of the system.

14.24.140 - Post-development stormwater management performance criteria. 
The following performance criteria shall be applicable to all stormwater management plans, unless otherwise provided for in this chapter: 
A.  Water Quality. All stormwater runoff generated from a site shall be adequately treated before discharge. It will be presumed that a stormwater management system complies with this requirement if: 
1.  It is sized to treat the prescribed water quality treatment volume from the site, as defined in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual; 
2.  Appropriate structural stormwater or nonstructural practices are selected, designed, constructed or preserved, and maintained according to the specific criteria in the GSMM; and 
3.  Runoff from hotspot land uses and activities identified by the city are adequately treated and addressed through the use of appropriate structural stormwater controls, nonstructural practices and pollution prevention practices. 
B.  Stream Channel Protection. Protection of stream channels from bank and bed erosion and degradation shall be provided by using all of the following three approaches: 
1.  Preservation, restoration and/or reforestation (with native vegetation) of the applicable stream buffer; 
2.  Twenty-four (24) hour extended detention storage of the one-year, twenty-four (24) hour return frequency storm event. 
This requirement may be adjusted or waived by the city for sites that discharge directly into larger streams, rivers, wetlands, or lakes, or to a man-made channel or conveyance system where the reduction in these flows will not have an impact on upstream or downstream streambank or channel integrity; 
3.  Erosion prevention measures such as energy dissipation and velocity control. 
C.  Overbank Flooding Protection. Downstream overbank flood and property protection shall be provided by controlling (attenuating) the post-development peak discharge rate to the pre-development rate for the twenty-five (25) year, twenty-four (24) hour return frequency storm event. If control of the one-year, twenty-four (24) hour storm under subsection (B)(2) of this section is exempted, then peak discharge rate attenuation of the two-year through the twenty-five (25) year return frequency storm event must be provided. 
This requirement may be adjusted or waived by the city for sites where the post-development downstream analysis shows that uncontrolled post-development conditions will not increase downstream peak flows, or that meeting the requirement will cause greater peak flow downstream impacts than the uncontrolled post-development conditions. 
D.  Extreme Flooding Protection. Extreme flood and public safety protection shall be provided by controlling and safely conveying the one hundred (100) year, twenty-four (24) hour return frequency storm event such that flooding is not exacerbated. 
This requirement may be adjusted or waived by the city for sites where the post-development downstream analysis shows that uncontrolled post-development conditions will not increase downstream peak flows, or that meeting the requirement will cause greater peak flow downstream impacts than the uncontrolled post-development conditions. 
E.  Structural Stormwater Controls. All structural stormwater management facilities shall be selected and designed using the appropriate criteria from the GSMM. All structural stormwater controls must be designed appropriately to meet their intended function. For other structural stormwater controls not included in the GSMM, or for which pollutant removal rates have not been provided, the effectiveness and pollutant removal of the structural control must be documented through prior studies, literature reviews, or other means and receive approval from the city before being included in the design of a stormwater management system. In addition, if hydrologic or topographic conditions, or land use activities warrant greater control than that provided by the GSMM control requirements, the city may impose additional requirements deemed necessary to protect upstream and downstream properties and aquatic resources from damage due to increased volume, frequency, and rate of stormwater runoff or increased nonpoint source pollution loads created on the site in question. 
Applicants shall consult the GSMM for guidance on the factors that determine site design feasibility when selecting and locating a structural stormwater control. 
F.  Stormwater Credits for Nonstructural Measures. The use of one or more site design measures by the applicant may allow for a reduction in the water quality treatment volume required under GSMM. The applicant may, if approved by the city, take credit for the use of stormwater better site design practices and reduce the water quality volume requirement. For each potential credit, GSMM provides a minimum set of criteria and requirements which identify the conditions or circumstances under which the credit may be applied. The site design practices that qualify for this credit and the criteria and procedures for applying and calculating the credits are included in the GSMM. 
G.  Drainage System Guidelines. Stormwater conveyance facilities, which may include but are not limited to culverts, stormwater drainage pipes, catch basins, drop inlets, junction boxes, headwalls, gutter, swales, channels, ditches, and energy dissipaters shall be provided when necessary for the protection of public right-of-way and private properties adjoining project sites and/or public rights-of-way. Stormwater conveyance facilities that are designed to carry runoff from more than one parcel, existing or proposed, shall meet the following requirements: 
1.  Methods to calculate stormwater flows shall be in accordance with the GSMM; 
2.  All culverts, pipe systems and open channel flow systems shall be sized in accordance with the stormwater management plan using the methods included in the GSMM; and 
3.  Design and construction of stormwater conveyance facilities shall be in accordance with the criteria and specifications found in the GSMM.

The provisions of this chapter shall be known as the city's "Tree Preservation Ordinance." 
(Ord. dated 6/30/08 (part)) 
14.28.020 - Purpose. 
Tree Canopy Cover. The purpose of these provisions is to regulate the conservation, protection, maintenance, and establishment of trees within the city in order to maintain at least sixty (60) percent tree canopy cover across the city and increase the city's tree canopy cover wherever and whenever possible, to preserve tree and community forest health, and to contribute to community health, safety, and welfare. 
Trees as Infrastructure. Trees and the community forest are a component of the community infrastructure, and as such provide benefits and require management, including maintenance, removal, and replacement to maximize their useful service life. As with other infrastructure, trees shall be maintained in a safe and healthy condition to provide maximum benefits with minimum risk. 
Tree Benefits. Trees, tree canopy, and tree roots conserve soil and maintain soil health, reduce soil erosion and sedimentation, shade streams, and improve water quality. 
Trees and tree canopy shade the soil, pavement, buildings, other property, and infrastructure, and cool the environment through the evaporation of water during leaf transpiration. Trees moderate temperatures, decrease the urban heat island effect, reduce the amount of volatile organic compounds released from parked vehicles, and extend the useful life of property and infrastructure. 
Trees and tree canopy filter particulate matter from the air and absorb carbon dioxide and other harmful compounds, reduce air pollution, and contribute to human survival and health. 
Trees and tree canopy provide recreational places and opportunities. The presence of trees has psychological and social benefits, including reduction of domestic violence, improvement in learning among youth, reduction in healing times, hospital stays, and medication needs, and calming of traffic. 
Trees and tree canopy provide economic benefits because they increase property values and bring residents and visitors to a community, resulting in increased commerce and trade. 
Trees are effective buffers and provide visual screening, noise reduction, and reduce light glare.

14.28.100 - Tree canopy cover. 
Minimum Tree Canopy Cover Required. For new developments within each zoning district, a minimum amount of healthy tree canopy cover, measured in square feet of projection of the canopy onto the ground, shall be conserved and/or established within the net area of each parcel. The required amount of tree canopy cover shall be maintained throughout the life of the development except as exempted in Section 14.28.050. Tree canopy cover requirements are listed by zoning district in Table A of this section. Trees in poor or declining condition, as determined by the building official, shall not be credited toward the required tree canopy coverage. 
Table A  Minimum Tree Canopy Coverage and Landscaped  Area Required by Zoning District 

 
Minimum Amount of Conserved Trees. For all new developments, a minimum of one-half of the tree canopy cover required shall originate from the conservation of existing trees, if there are sufficient existing trees in good condition on the site as determined by the building official. If there are no sufficient trees in good condition and the one-half requirement cannot be met, then the deficit shall be made up through tree planting. 
Distribution. Tree canopy cover shall be distributed as evenly as practicable throughout the development. 
Parking Areas. Within parking areas at least one canopy tree shall be planted or conserved within the interior and along the perimeter of the parking lot for each seven parking spaces. In no case shall a parking space be greater than one hundred sixty-five (165) feet from a tree. Trees planted or conserved to meet this requirement shall be counted toward the overall tree canopy cover requirement. 
Buffers, Open Areas, and Recreation Areas. Where buffers, open areas, and recreation areas are required, the required canopy cover percent shall apply to the net area. 
Size Composition. In no case shall the number of medium or large maturing canopy trees conserved and/or planted account for less than seventy (70) percent of the total canopy cover required. 
Canopy Cover Calculations. The canopy of each conserved tree shall be calculated by measuring the diameter of the crown at its widest point and multiplying that by the diameter of the crown perpendicular to the first measurement. The resulting square foot area is the contribution of the tree to total tree canopy cover area required. In lieu of measuring actual tree canopy cover, each tree conserved may be assigned the canopy cover areas listed below: 

 
When calculating the number of trees required, any fraction below 0.5 shall be rounded down to the next lower whole number, and any fraction equal to or greater than 0.5 shall be rounded up to the next highest whole number. 
For conserved trees, multiple, adjacent trees with overlapping crowns shall be credited with the amount of canopy cover they collectively project onto the ground. Trees with trunks growing directly on top of a property boundary line shall be credited with only that portion of the canopy projection that falls onto the permitted property, or one-half of the assigned canopy cover area as provided for in this section. No credit shall be given for trees whose trunks are growing solely on adjacent property that overhang the permitted property. 
(Ord. dated 6/30/08 (part)) 
14.28.110 - Community tree species list.

Permeable surfaces include, but are not limited to, mulch, turf, crushed rock, and permeable paving materials, as well as areas covered by shrubs and herbaceous plants. 
For conserved trees, the required permeable surface area shall coincide with the critical root zone. The building official may allow permeable pavement or materials in up to thirty (30) percent of the critical root zone. In no case shall less than seventy (70) percent of the critical root zone consist of soil covered with mulch. The area of soil covered with mulch shall be a circle that has the tree trunk as its center. 
Where natural, undisturbed forest conditions and a natural leaf litter layer exist, no mulch shall be required. 
For planted trees, the amount of permeable surface area required shall be based upon the mature tree size category as follows: 

 
For planted trees, a minimum of fifty (50) percent of the permeable surface area required shall consist of soil covered with mulch and shall be that area immediately surrounding the tree trunk. Exposed soil shall not be allowed but shall be covered with a three to four inch layer of organic mulch.

14.28.200 - Site inspections. 
Authority. The building official has the authority to perform site inspections and enforce the provisions of this chapter. 
Site Inspections. Prior to the issuance of a soil and tree conservation permit or right-of-way encroachment permit, a visit shall be made to the proposed site by the building official and the applicant for the purpose of discussing the provisions of this chapter. 
After a soil and tree conservation permit or right-of-way encroachment permit is issued and tree protection measures have been installed, and prior to any land disturbance, another site inspection shall be made by the building official. 
Another site inspection shall occur prior to the issuance of final plat approval or a certificate of occupancy. All provisions of this chapter shall be met before final plat approval or a certificate of occupancy can be issued. 
Other site inspections may take place without notice at any time prior to or after the issuance of a certificate of occupancy or final plat approval to insure continuing compliance with the provisions of this chapter. 
Access. No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the building official who requests entry for the purposes of inspection and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper, or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
Release of Bond. Prior to the release of a tree establishment bond and within thirty-six (36) months of issuance of final plat approval or a certificate of occupancy, a site inspection will be made to determine ongoing compliance with the provisions of this chapter. If noncompliance exists, the bond shall be held until compliance occurs or for a maximum of forty-eight (48) months. If compliance does not occur within forty-eight (48) months from the date of issuance of the certificate of occupancy or final plat approval, the bond shall be forfeited to the city and deposited in the tree bank. 
(Ord. dated 6/30/08 (part)) 
14.28.210 - Tree bank. 
When a documented hardship exists that results in a person's inability to achieve the required tree canopy cover, the building official may require a fee to be paid to the city for deposit in the city's tree bank in lieu of the conservation or establishment of trees. Funds in the tree bank shall be used for planting or maintaining trees on city property. The fee shall be calculated by first subtracting the number of square feet of tree canopy achievable from the number of square feet of tree canopy required, and then multiplying the result by one dollar ($1.00). For example, if ten thousand (10,000) square feet of tree canopy is required, and only eight thousand (8,000) is achievable, then the difference in the two, two thousand (2,000) feet, is multiplied by one dollar ($1.00), equaling two thousand dollars ($2,000.00). 
Tree protection bonds and tree establishment bonds forfeited due to failure to comply with the provisions of this chapter shall also be deposited in the tree bank and used for planting or maintaining city trees. 
(Ord. dated 6/30/08 (part))

(Ord. dated 6/30/08 (part); Ord. dated 9-15-2014(4), § 1) 
14.28.270 - Hazardous trees. 
It shall be the duty of owners of property within the corporate limits of the city to maintain trees growing thereon so as to prevent such trees from becoming a danger to existing city streets, sidewalks or utility right-of-way easements and appurtenances thereto. In the event that the city arborist, city marshal or building inspector, upon inspection as authorized in Section 14.28.200 of this chapter, determines that a tree constitutes a danger to an existing city street, sidewalk or utility right-of-way easement, due to overgrowth or root encroachment or risk of falling limbs or trunk resulting from decline or death of the tree, the building official shall notify the appropriate property owner of the condition constituting such danger, the action required to eliminate the danger and the time, not to exceed fifteen (15) days, within which the condition must be eliminated. Such notice shall be given in writing by mail, addressed to the last known address of the record owner of the property. The notice shall be deemed effective two days after mailing. If the condition constituting such danger is not eliminated in accordance with the terms of the notice, the condition shall be deemed a nuisance and prosecuted as provided in Chapter 8.12 of this Code.

Chapter 14.32 - OVERLAY DISTRICTS 

14.32.010 - Conservation village design overlay district. 
A.  General Statement. The provisions of this section and the regulations set forth in the next following section shall govern all development in the CVD overlay district. This district will be an overlay zone on the official zoning map. 
B.  Purpose and Intent. The purpose and intent of the CVD district (CVDD) is to allow, coordinate and regulate large scale or comprehensive group development which may not follow standard design practices otherwise allowed by the city's zoning regulations. CVDD developments will not normally contemplate the normal layout of lots, blocks and streets or single uses. 
C.  Adherence to Procedures and Regulations Required. Conservation village design districts will sometimes involve mixed uses, varying density, the grouping of housing and/or open areas, and densities and setbacks that are not traditional in developments of the type being sought by the initial developer in a CVDD. 
D.  Conditions for Rezoning. Property will be considered for rezoning to the CVDD only in accordance with the following conditions, procedures and regulations: 
1.  Ownership—Sale or Transfer. All of the land to be contained within a proposed CVDD must be owned at the time of the application by the same individual, corporation or other legal entity. Further, no interest in the said land may be sold or otherwise transferred until the original applicant has had an acknowledgment in the form approved by the city recorded in the Newton County deed records that the overall tract of land described therein is a portion of a CVDD which will result in substantial, perpetual restrictions on the future use of the said land, including: 
a.  Designating portions thereof as open areas which will prohibit, in perpetuity, the areas so designated for any use other than as open areas; and 
b.  Prohibiting the redevelopment of any areas of the CVDD at a density greater than that assigned to the area of the CVDD at the time of final approval of the development plan for that area; however, this shall not prohibit the same owner of more than one area of a CVDD from reassigning density rights between two or more areas of the CVDD as long as such reassignment is approved by the planning commission, does not increase the overall density of the CVDD and is otherwise consistent with the provisions of this section. 
2.  Conditions for Preliminary Approval. In considering the preliminary approval for the rezoning of property to the CVDD use district, the planning commission and the mayor and council shall consider the following, and give preliminary approval only upon satisfaction of the conditions: 
a.  The proposal utilizes design and development standards which would not be permitted in any other zoning district or which would combine various types of uses of housing into a single district; 
b.  The proposal would not substantially alter or adversely affect nearby property values; 
c.  The proposal would not be incompatible with existing land use within the area; 
d.  The proposal would not be inconsistent with the goals and policies of the city's comprehensive land use plan or with the purposes of this chapter; 
e.  The site plan for the proposal provides for adequate ingress and egress for vehicular traffic and would not create safety, health or unreasonable traffic problems in the area; 
f.  The proposal makes adequate provisions for community facilities such as water, sewer, recreation and open areas. The recreation and open areas shall consist of not less than fifty (50) percent of the proposed CVDD land area, of which not less than one-half must be outside of all flood hazard areas as defined in Chapter 15.48 of this code. 
g.  The proposal is justified based on facts presented to indicate the need for such development as called for in the city's comprehensive zoning plan; 
h.  The proposal does not have commercial areas in excess of three percent of the CVDD's land area; and 
i.  Off-street parking and loading space are provided in accordance with Chapter 16.44. 
3.  Minimum Size. Due to the administrative expense and procedures involved in approving and monitoring CVDD developments to ensure compliance with CVDD special conditions, such as density and limits on nonresidential uses, the minimum area that will qualify for CVDD zoning is fifty (50) acres; provided, however, that smaller tracts of land contiguous to an existing CVDD may be rezoned to CVDD if same are an expansion of the existing adjacent CVDD. 
4.  Permitted Uses. The CVD district is planned to be primarily a residential district with small percentages of the total land area contained within the district being available for use for multifamily, residential/professional, community commercial and zero lot line development. In order to assure that the limited use and overall density requirements for a CVDD are not violated, the following express limitations must be satisfied in each phase of the CVDD approval and development: 
a.  The maximum area of a CVDD to be developed or allotted for development as neighborhood mixed use (NM district, Chapter 16.16 of this code) and corridor mixed use (CM district, Chapter 16.16) cannot exceed three percent of the total CVDD area. All areas of a CVDD designated for neighborhood mixed use or corridor mixed use will be subject to the same use restrictions contained in the said code sections, respectively; provided further that no such areas of the CVDD may be contiguous to any property outside of the CVDD that is in the NR1, NR2 and NR3 districts, as shown on the city's official. 
b.  The maximum area of a CVDD to be developed or allotted for development as multifamily areas within the CVDD shall be subject to the same conditions and restrictions as developments within the city's CR district; provided, however, that the maximum density per acre within the multifamily portion of the CVDD may be increased as provided in subsection (D)(5) of this section. 
c.  Any use permitted in the NR1 use district under Chapter 16.16 of this code, subject to the same conditions as the aforesaid section, except lot size, building size and setbacks shall be permitted anywhere in the CVDD except in those areas set aside as open areas. 
d.  Open areas shall be dispersed throughout the CVDD development so as to be readily available to various developments within the CVDD. Building improvements designed for use in conjunction with the open areas in excess of one percent of the total area of the open areas and parking lots and other impervious coverings on open areas in excess of three percent of the total open space area shall not be considered open areas for the purpose of determining density requirements for the overall CVDD project. 
e.  Except as hereinafter provided, height limitations, minimum lot areas, setbacks (front, side and rear yard) and minimum building size shall be established by the planning commission and approved by the mayor and council in conjunction with the final approval for each area of development within the CVDD. Unless there is a dedicated open area at least fifty (50) feet in width as measured at right angles to the outer boundary of the CVDD that separates property outside of the CVDD from improvements inside the CVDD, the height, lot area, building size, and setbacks adjacent to the outer boundary of the CVDD shall conform to those of the zoning district adjacent to the respective boundaries of the CVDD. The foregoing provisions may be waived as to those areas of the exterior boundary of the CVDD for which the adjoining property owner signs a written waiver in recording form approved by the city building official. 
5.  Density. Unless increased by approval of the planning commission and the mayor and council as part of the general approval of special criteria, the gross density for the CVDD shall be as provided for in Chapter 16.16 of this code. "Net acreage" means the gross area within the CVDD exterior boundaries inclusive of streets, roads and other rights-of-way, but excluding the maximum area planned for either residential/professional or community commercial development and those portions of the areas designated as open areas that exceed the permitted limitations on building area and impervious surface areas (such as parking lots) contained in subsection (D)(4)(d) of this section. 
6.  Application of Other Code Provisions. Unless waived by the mayor and council as a part of its general approval of special criteria for the CVDD, each development within the CVDD shall comply with all other ordinances and regulations contained within this code, including, but not limited to, off-street parking requirements, utilities specifications, floodplain and soil erosion regulations, issuance of building permits and inspections, the Georgia State Energy Code, all Standard Building Codes, National Electrical Code, Fire Codes, fire walls, fire petitions, planning commission review for subdivisions and any other code provisions or regulation that are normally applicable to developing property within the city. 
7.  Right-of-Way Requirements. Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, upon approval of the planning commission, streets within CVDD may remain private as long as all city specifications for right-of-way widths, grading and paving are fulfilled. 
8.  Land Use. Since the primary intended use of land area within a CVDD is single-family residential, any area of a CVDD may be platted and subdivided in accordance with the city's subdivision regulations as though the same were in the NR1 use district unless such subdivision would result in exceeding the overall density requirements of the CVDD. 
E.  Approval Process. The process to secure the zoning and approval for development of property as a CVDD will involve the following three separate steps: 
1.  The preliminary approval, which may result in property being rezoned to the CVDD use district; 
2.  The general approval of special criteria, whereby the exact metes and bounds description of the CVDD is established and any special criteria (including mixed uses and special exceptions such as densities not otherwise approved) are established; 
3.  The final approval, which involves: 
a.  The planning commission's approval of a subdivision plat for recordation in accordance with the provisions of Sections 16.12.140 and 16.12.250 of this code, except as such provisions may be modified by the provisions of this section and the general approval of special criteria by the mayor and council; and 
b.  Approval of such plat by the mayor and council. 
F.  Specific Requirements for CVDD Approval. 
1.  Preliminary Approval. The preliminary approval process shall be commenced by the applicant's submission of an application to the planning commission, requesting that the property described be considered for a CVDD development. The planning commission shall conduct a hearing to review the application, the site plan, and tentative draft of regulations concerning the applicant's proposed CVDD. If the planning commission determines that the application is consistent with the provisions of the regulations contained in this section, it shall recommend to the mayor and council that the property be considered for rezoning to the CVDD classification. In making such recommendation, the planning commission shall point out any areas of special concern regarding the application and shall enumerate same for further consideration by the applicant and by the mayor and council at a subsequent public hearing. The applicant may also request that the planning commission consider the general approval of special criteria in conjunction with its consideration of the preliminary approval. After the planning commission takes its action on the preliminary approval (and the general approval of special criteria, if applicable), the secretary to the planning commission shall coordinate with the city clerk in scheduling the application (both preliminary approval and general approval of special criteria) for a public hearing before the mayor and council. Since final action by the mayor and council on the preliminary approval shall constitute a rezoning of the property from the existing zoning district to the CVDD, the city clerk shall cause a legal notice to be placed in the legal organ for Newton County, Georgia, at least fifteen (15) days prior to the scheduled public hearing. The notice shall give the time, place and purpose of the public hearing. After conducting the public hearing, the mayor and council shall either: (i) reject the application, stating the reasons therefor, (ii) remand the application to the planning commission for further consideration with recommendations thereon in light of any comments developed at the public hearing, or (iii) grant preliminary approval. A grant of preliminary approval by the mayor and council shall have the legal effect of changing the property in question from the then existing zoning district to the CVD district. Notwithstanding the fact that consideration of preliminary approval by the mayor and council shall have included consideration of the applicant's request for a general approval of special criteria and the applicant's proposed regulations concerning the CVDD development, the grant of preliminary approval shall not constitute approval either in whole or in part of such regulations and/or special criteria. 
2.  General Approval of Special Criteria. Either in conjunction with the applicant's preliminary approval application, as specified in the immediately preceding subsection, or after the mayor and council have granted preliminary approval, the applicant shall apply to the planning commission for general approval of special criteria. The application shall be in the form specified by the planning commission and shall address, in detail, the following: 
a.  The exact amount of acreage contained in the applicant's CVDD areas as shown on a plat of survey thereof by a Georgia licensed surveyor or engineer; 
b.  The minimum land of area to be dedicated as open area and the maximum land area to be developed for multifamily residential use; 
c.  The maximum land area to be developed for residential/professional and/or community commercial uses; 
d.  Proposed restrictive covenants; and 
e.  Specifications for the general areas within CVDD to be developed for the respective proposed uses and a statement of the maximum number of residences to be constructed within the CVDD if greater than that allowed under subsection (D)(5) of this section; 
f.  After receipt of the application for general approval of special criteria, the planning commission shall conduct a hearing thereon and either specify the reasons for refusing to recommend approval of any or all of the special criteria requested (in which event the applicant shall be entitled to gather further information or change the special criteria requested), or the planning commission shall recommend approval thereof to the mayor and council. Upon recommendation of the special criteria by the planning commission, the secretary to the planning commission shall coordinate with the city clerk to schedule a public hearing thereon before the mayor and council after publication of notice of the type required for preliminary approval as specified in subsection (F)(1) of this section. 
g.  After the public hearing on the application for general approval of special criteria, the mayor and council shall either approve or reject the application either in whole or in part and specify the reasons therefor. Only those special criteria expressly approved by the mayor and council as aforesaid may be incorporated by the applicant into the final development plans for the CVDD or any portion thereof. The mayor and council may grant tentative general approval of special criteria (for example, in approving tentative drafts of restrictive covenants for various developments within the CVDD) and reserve final approval on specific special criteria items as a part of the final approval process. 
3.  Final Approval. Final approval shall be appropriate only after the developer has submitted detailed plans and specifications for plat approval, both preliminary and final, in accordance with the city's subdivision regulations contained in Chapter 14.08 of this title. The approval process shall be in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 14.08 of this title, but modified to the extent necessary to reflect that: 
a.  The density, lot size and setback requirements that apply to each phase of the development may be in accordance with the provisions of this section, including any special criteria contained in the general approval of special criteria; 
b.  If the development contemplated by this application has a proposed density greater than the maximum overall density per acre within the CVDD, the applicant shall have designated and dedicated sufficient open area to ensure that the overall approved density within the CVDD will not be exceeded if developed to its full potential. As used herein the term "dedicated" as it relates to open areas, shall mean the official designation in the deed records of Newton County, Georgia, of a land area by plat dedication and/or written declaration, with a metes and bounds description of an area as "open area" in a conservation village design district under the city's CVDD regulations, in form and substance satisfactory to the city attorney; 
c.  Together with the final plat the developer shall submit the final restrictive covenants and/or easements for the area encompassed by the plat under consideration for approval; 
d.  After the planning commission has approved the plat and the developer's restrictive covenants, the planning commission shall forward same to the mayor and council, and approval thereof by the mayor and council shall constitute final approval of the areas encompassed by the plat(s) and the restrictive covenants; and 
e.  The city's building official shall maintain such information as necessary to ensure that each CVDD complies with the provisions of this section. Such information shall include a detailed listing of total areas within the CVDD, the maximum amount of multifamily residential development, the maximum amount of residential/professional or community commercial development, the maximum number of residential units permitted within CVDD, the maximum number of residential units per acre to be constructed in areas dedicated from time to time as open area and a running total of final approvals given and areas thereby committed to specified densities and uses. 
G.  Modifications. After securing final approval by the mayor and council for a development within a CVDD, all development on that portion must be done according to the plans approved, and no adjustments or alterations to said plans shall be made without prior approval of each body whose approval was required to secure such final approval. 
1.  In all areas that have received final approval for the development of a portion of the CVDD for neighborhood mixed use or corridor mixed use of this commercial use, all signs shall be in conformity with the provisions of Chapter 16.48 of this code applicable to the city's NM and CM districts. 
2.  In all other areas of the CVDD not covered by subsection (G)(1) of this section, all signs shall be in conformity with the provisions of Chapter 16.48 of this code applicable to the city's NR1 and NR2 single-family residential use districts. 
H.  Conservation village design subdivision conditions for preliminary approval. The applicant shall provide a map of the primary conservation area site, including basic topography, location of wetlands, hundred-year floodplains, slopes exceeding twenty-five (25) percent and soils subject to slumping. 
I.  Density Incentives. 
1.  Maintenance Endowment. To endow maintenance fund the city may allow a density bonus to generate additional income to the applicant for the express and sole purpose of endowing a permanent fund to offset continuing open space maintenance costs. Endowment funds should be twenty (20) times the annual amount estimated to be required to maintain the open space. On the assumption that the sale of an additional lot, over and above the maximum number that would ordinarily be permitted on the site, would be without allocable development costs and would represent true profit, seventy-five (75) percent of the net selling price of such lot shall be donated to the open space endowment fund for maintenance of the preserved lands within the subdivision. Such maintenance estimates shall be prepared by an agency or organization with experience in open space management acceptable to the planning commission. The fund shall be transferred by the developer to a designated entity, such as a homeowner's association, or a trustee approved by the planning commission. 
2.  Public Access. 
a.  Ten (10) percent of the total land shall be dedicated for public use. 
b.  The density bonus for open space that would be in addition to the ten (10) percent public land dedication shall be computed on the basis of a maximum of one dwelling unit for each five acres of open space dedicated for public use. The decision as to whether to accept an applicant's offer to dedicate open space for public use shall be within the discretion of the planning commission, which shall be guided by the recommendations contained in the city's open space recreation and environmental resources plan, particularly as said plan relates to trail networks and/or recreational facilities. 
3.  Affordable Housing. 
a.  A density increase may be permitted where the conservation subdivision proposal provides on-site or off-site housing opportunities for low or moderate income families. 
b.  The amount of the density increase shall be based on the following standard: For each affordable housing unit provided under this section, one additional building lot or dwelling unit shall be permitted, up to a maximum fifteen (15) percent increase in dwelling units. Affordable housing is herein defined as units to be sold or rented to families earning seventy (70) to one hundred twenty (120) percent of the county median income, adjusted for family size as determined by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
J.  Minimum Percentage of Open Space. The minimum percentage of land that shall be designated as permanent open space, not to be further subdivided and protected through a conservation easement held by the city or by a recognized land trust or conservancy, shall be as specified below. 
1.  A minimum of fifty (50) percent of the total tract area, after deducting the following kinds of land that is undesirable for building purposes: 
a.  Wetlands, i.e., land that is generally inundated (land under ponds, lakes, creeks, etc.); 
b.  All of the floodway and floodway fringe within the hundred-year floodplain, as shown on official FEMA maps; 
c.  Land with slopes exceeding twenty-five (25) percent or with soil subject to slumping; 
d.  Lands required for street rights-of-way, but not more than ten (10) percent of the net tract area; 
e.  Land under permanent easement prohibiting future development (including easements for drainage, access and utilities); 
f.  The above areas shall generally be designated as undivided open areas in order to facilitate easement monitoring and enforcement and to promote appropriate management by a single entity according to approved management standards. 
2.  At least twenty-five (25) percent of the minimum required open space shall be suitable for active recreation purposes, but no more than fifty (50) percent shall be utilized for that purpose, in order to preserve a reasonable proportion of natural areas on the site. The purpose for which open space areas are proposed shall be documented by the applicant. 
3.  The required open space may be used, without restrictions, for underground drainage fields for individual or community septic systems and for spray fields for spray irrigation purposes in a land application wastewater reclamation system. These systems shall be limited to no more than ten (10) percent of the required minimum open space. 
4.  Stormwater management ponds or basins may be included as part of the minimum required open space, as well as land within the right-of-way for underground pipe lines. However, land within the right-of-way of high-tension power lines shall not be included as comprising part of the minimum required open space. 
K.  Location of Open Space. The location of open space conserved through compact residential development shall be consistent with the policies contained in the open space, recreation and environmental resources element of the city's comprehensive plan, the recommendations contained in this section and the evaluation criteria hereinafter set forth. All undivided open space and any lot capable of further subdivision shall be restricted from further subdivision through a permanent conservation easement, in a form acceptable to the city and duly recorded in the Newton County deed records. 
L.  Classifications of Open Space. Open space shall be comprised of primary and secondary conservation areas. Both classes shall be protected by a permanent conservation easement prohibiting further development. 
1.  Primary Conservation Area. This class consists of wetlands that are generally inundated (under ponds, lakes, creeks, etc.), lands within the hundred-year floodplain, slopes exceeding twenty-five (25) percent, and soils subject to slumping. These sensitive lands shall be deducted from the total parcel acreage to produce the adjusted tract acreage on which density shall be based. 
2.  Secondary Conservation Area. In addition to the primary conservation areas, at least fifty (50) percent of the remaining land shall be designated as permanently protected. Full density credit shall be allowed for land in this category that would otherwise be buildable under local regulations, so that its development potential is not reduced by this designation. Greater latitude exists in the designation of secondary conservation areas, except that they shall include a one hundred (100) foot green-way buffer along all water bodies and watercourses, and a fifty (50) foot green-way buffer alongside wetlands soils classified as "very poorly drained" in the medium intensity county soil survey. The location of secondary conservation areas shall be guided by the maps and policies contained in the open space, recreation, and environmental resources element of the city's comprehensive plan, and shall typically include all or part of the following kinds of resources: 
a.  Mature woodlands; 
b.  Areas with highly permeable (excessively drained) soil; 
c.  Significant wildlife habitat areas; 
d.  Scenic views into the property from existing public roads; and 
e.  Secondary conservation areas therefore typically consist of upland forest, meadows, pastures, and farm fields, as a part of the ecologically connected matrix of natural areas significant for wildlife habitat and water quality protection. Although the resource lands listed as potential secondary conservation areas may comprise more than half of the remaining land on a development parcel (after primary conservation areas have been deducted), no applicant shall be required to designate more than fifty (50) percent of that remaining land as a secondary conservation area. 
3.  General Location Standards. Subdivisions and planned residential developments shall be designed around both the primary and secondary conservation areas, which together constitute the total required open space. The design process should, therefore, commence with the delineation of all potential open space, after which potential house sites are located. Both primary and secondary conservation areas shall be placed in undivided preserves, which may adjoin housing areas that have been designed more compactly to create larger areas that may be enjoyed equally by all residents of the development. 
4.  Undivided open space shall be directly accessible to the largest practicable number of lots within a conservation subdivision. 
The majority of house lots should abut undivided open space in order to provide direct views and access. Safe and convenient pedestrian access to the open space from all lots not adjoining the open space shall be provided, except such areas that are specifically designed as village greens, ball fields, upland buffers to wetlands, water bodies, watercourses or trail links. 
5.  Interconnected Open Space Network. The protected open spaces in each new subdivision will eventually adjoin each other, ultimately forming an interconnected network of primary and secondary conservation areas. 
M.  Evaluation Criteria. In evaluating the layout of lots and open space, the following criteria will be considered by the planning commission as indicating design appropriate to the site's natural, historic, and cultural features, and meeting the purposes of this section. Diversity and originality in lot layout shall be encouraged to achieve the best possible relationship between development and conservation areas. Accordingly, the planning commission shall evaluate proposals to determine whether the proposed conceptual preliminary plan: 
1.  Protects and preserves all floodplains, wetlands, and steep slopes from clearing, grading, filling or construction (except as may be approved by the city for essential infrastructure or recreation amenities); 
2.  Preserves and maintains mature woodlands, existing fields, pastures, meadows, and orchards, and creates sufficient buffer areas to minimize conflicts between residential and agricultural uses. Locating house lots and driveways within wooded areas is generally recommended except where such location: 
a.  Involves significant wildlife habitat or mature woodlands that raise an equal or greater preservation concern, as described in subsections (M)(5) and (M)(8) of this section, 
b.  Involves predominantly agricultural areas where remnant tree groups provide the only natural areas for wildlife habitat; 
3.  If development must be located on open fields or pastures because of greater constraints in all other parts of the site, the following must apply: 
a.  Dwellings should be sited on the least desirable agricultural soils or in locations at the far edge of a field, as seen from existing public roads, and 
b.  The development should be visually buffered from existing public roads, such as by a planting screen consisting of a variety of indigenous native trees, shrubs and wildflowers; 
4.  Maintains or creates an upland buffer of natural native species vegetation of at least one hundred (100) feet in depth adjacent to wetlands and surface waters, including creeks, streams, springs, lakes and ponds; 
5.  Designs around existing hedgerow and tree lines between fields or meadows, and minimizes impacts on large woodlands in poor condition with limited management potential which can provide suitable locations for residential developments. When any woodland is developed great care shall be taken to design all disturbed areas (for buildings, roads, yards, etc.) in locations where there are no large trees or obvious wildlife areas, to the fullest extent that is practicable; 
6.  Leaves scenic views and vistas open for uninterrupted viewing, particularly as seen from public thoroughfare, utilizing the following criteria: 
a.  In open agrarian landscapes, a deep "no-build, no-plant" buffer is recommended along any public thoroughfare where those views or vistas are prominent or locally significant, 
b.  The concept of "foreground meadows," with homes facing the public thoroughfare across a broad grassy expanse is strongly preferred to mere buffer strips, with or without berms or vegetative screening, and 
c.  In wooded areas where the sense of enclosure is a feature that should be maintained, a deep "no-built, no-cut" buffer should be respected, to preserve existing vegetation; 
7.  Avoids siting new construction on prominent hilltops or ridges by taking advantage of lower topography feature; 
8.  Protects wildlife habitat areas of species listed as endangered, threatened, or of special concern; 
9.  Designs around and preserves sites of historic, archaeological, or cultural value, and their environment, insofar as needed to safeguard the character of the feature, including stone walls, spring houses, barns, foundations, cellar holes, earthworks and burial grounds; 
10.  Protects rural roadside character and improves public safety and vehicular carrying capacity by avoiding development fronting directly onto existing public streets and establishes buffer zones along the scenic corridors or rural roads with historic buildings, stone walls, hedgerows or other significant features; 
11.  Landscapes common areas (in compliance with the city's tree ordinance), such as cul-de-sac islands and both sides of new streets, with native species shade trees and flowering shrubs with high wildlife conservation value; 
12.  Provides active recreational areas in suitable locations that offer convenient access by residents and adequate screening from nearby house lots; 
13.  Includes a pedestrian circulation system designed to assure that pedestrians can walk safely and easily on the site, between properties and activities or special features within the neighborhood open space system. All roadside footpaths should connect with off-road trails, which in turn should link with potential open space on adjoining undeveloped parcels; 
14.  Provides open space that is reasonably contiguous utilizing the following criteria: 
a.  Fragmentation of open space should be minimized so that these resource areas are not divided into numerous small parcels located in various parts of the development, 
b.  Conservation land shall be designed as a single block with logical, straightforward boundaries. Long thin strips of conservation land shall be avoided, unless the conservation feature is linear or unless such configuration is necessary to connect with other streams and trails, 
c.  Open spaces shall generally abut existing or potential open space land on adjacent parcels. Such subdivision open space shall be designed as part of larger contiguous and integrated green-way systems, as set forth in the open space, recreation, and environmental resources element of the city's comprehensive plan. 
N.  Conservation Village Design Site Planning Procedures. The following sequence of procedural steps prescribed in this chapter shall be followed in the order listed and may be combined only at the discretion of the planning commission: 
1.  Pre-Application Discussion. A pre-application discussion is strongly encouraged between the applicant, the site designer and the planning commission. The purpose of this meeting is to introduce the applicant and the site designer to the city zoning and subdivision regulations and procedures and to discuss the applicant's objectives in relation to the city's policies and code requirements. 
2.  Existing Features (Site Analysis) Plan. Plans analyzing each site's special features are required for all proposed CVDD subdivisions, as they form the basis of the design process for green-way lands, house locations, street alignments and lot lines. The applicant or his/her representative shall bring a copy of the existing features (site analysis) plan to the on-site walking inspections. Such site analysis plans must include at least: 
a.  A contour map based upon topographical maps published by the U.S. Geological Survey; 
b.  The location of severely constraining elements such as steep slopes (over twenty-five (25) percent), wetlands, watercourses, intermittent streams, one hundred (100) year floodplain and all right-of-way easements; 
c.  Soil boundaries as shown on U.S.D.A. Natural Resources Conservation Service medium intensity maps; 
d.  The location of significant features such as woodlands, tree lines, open fields or meadows, scenic views into or out from the property, watershed divides, drainage ways, fences, stone walls, rock outcrops, existing structures, roads, tracks and trails; 
e.  These existing features shall identify both primary conservation areas (floodplains, wetlands, and steep slopes, as defined in the process for computing "adjusted tract acreage") and secondary conservation areas, as described in subsection (L)(2) of this section. Together, these primary and secondary conservation areas comprise the development's proposed open space, the location of which shall be consistent with the city's comprehensive plan. The site analysis plan shall form the basis for the conceptual preliminary plan which shall show the tentative location of houses, streets, lot lines and green-way lands in new subdivisions, according to the four-step design process described in subsection (N)(7) of this section. 
3.  On-Site Walking Inspection by Planning Commission and Applicant. After the site analysis plan has been prepared, the planning commission shall schedule a mutually convenient date to walk the property with the applicant and the applicant's site designer. The purpose of this visit is to familiarize city officials with the property's special features and to provide them with an opportunity to offer guidance to the applicant regarding the tentative location of secondary conservation areas and potential house locations and street alignments. If the visit is not scheduled before submission of the sketch plan or the conceptual preliminary plan, it should occur soon thereafter. 
4.  Pre-Submission Conference. Prior to the submission of the sketch plan or a conceptual preliminary plan, the applicant shall meet with the planning commission to discuss how the four-step approach to designing subdivision described in subsection (N)(7) of this section, could be applied to the subject property. At the discretion of the planning commission this conference may be combined with the on-site walking inspection. 
5.  Conceptual Preliminary Plan. After the pre-submission conference, a sketch plan or a conceptual preliminary plan shall be submitted for any proposed CVDD subdivision. As used in this section, the term "conceptual preliminary plan" refers to a preliminary engineered sketch plan drawn to illustrate initial thoughts about a conceptual layout for green-way lands, house sites and street alignments. At this stage are tentatively illustrated before premature engineering costs are incurred in the design of any proposed subdivision layout. Conceptual preliminary plans shall be prepared by a team that includes a landscape architect and a civil engineer. This plan shall be submitted by the applicant to the city zoning official who will then submit it to the planning commission for review for the purpose of securing early agreement on the overall pattern of streets, house lots, primary and secondary conservation areas and potential trail linkages prior to any significant expenditures for engineering the street design, stormwater management, or accurate delineation of internal lot boundaries. 
6.  Within thirty (30) days of receiving the conceptual preliminary plan the planning commission shall approve, disapprove or approve it with conditions, stating the reasons for its decision in writing. The remaining sixty (60) days of the statutory ninety (90) day review period for preliminary plans shall be utilized by the applicant to submit a detailed preliminary plan which shall contain all the customary engineering data, and for the planning commission to review said plan and to render its decision in writing. Either or both of these time periods may be formally extended if mutually agreeable to the applicant and the planning commission. 
7.  Four-Step Process. Each conceptual preliminary plan shall follow a four-step design process, as described below. When the conceptual preliminary plan is submitted, the applicant shall be prepared to demonstrate to the planning commission that these four design steps were followed by their site designers in determining the layout of their proposed streets, house lots, and green-way lands. This process shall be accomplished during the first thirty (30) days of the statutory ninety (90) day review period for preliminary plans. 
a.  Designating the Open Spaces. During the first step, all potential conservation areas (both primary and secondary) are identified, using the site analysis plan. Guidance on which parts of the remaining land to classify as secondary conservation areas shall be based upon: 
i.  On-site visits or walking inspections; 
ii.  The open space location criteria contained in subsection (L)(3) of this section; 
b.  The evaluation criteria listed in subsection M of this section; 
c.  Information from published data and reports; and 
d.  Conversation with existing or recent owners of the property and members of the mayor and council and planning commission. 
8.  Location of House Sites. During the second step, potential house sites are tentatively located. Because the proposed locations of houses within each lot represents a significant decision with potential impacts on the ability of the development to meet the evaluation criteria contained in subsection U of this section, subdivision applicants shall identify tentative house sites on the conceptual preliminary plan and proposed house sites on the detailed final plan. House sites should generally be located not closer than one hundred (100) feet from primary conservation areas, but may be situated within fifty (50) feet of secondary conservation areas, in order to enjoy views of the latter without negatively impacting the former the building foot-print of proposed residences may be changed by more than fifty (50) feet in any direction with majority approval of the planning commission. Such changes involving less than fifty (50) feet do not require such approval. 
9.  Street and Lot Layout. The third step consists of aligning proposed streets to provide vehicular access to each house in the most reasonable and economical way. When lots and access streets are laid out, they shall be located in a way that avoids or at least minimizes adverse impacts on the primary and secondary conservation areas. To the greatest extent practicable, wetland crossings and streets traversing existing slopes of over fifteen (15) percent shall be strongly discouraged. Street connections shall generally be encouraged to minimize the number of new cul-de-sacs to be maintained by the city, and to facilitate easy access to and from homes in different parts of the property and on adjoining parcels. Where cul-de-sacs are necessary, those serving six or fewer homes may be designed with a "hammerhead" configuration, facilitating three-point turns. Cul-de-sacs serving more than six homes shall generally be designed with a central island containing indigenous trees and shrubs, either conserved on site or planted on site. In a CVD where more formal, "neo-traditional," or village type layouts are proposed, the preceding steps two and three may be reversed, so that the location of house sites follows the location of streets and squares. 
10.  Lot Lines. The fourth step is to draw in the lot lines. They are generally drawn midway between house locations and may include L-shaped "flag lots" meeting the city's minimum standard codes for the same. 
O.  Preliminary Engineering Certification. Prior to approval of the conceptual preliminary plan, the applicant shall submit to the planning commission a preliminary engineering certification from a Georgia licensed professional engineer that the approximate layout of proposed streets, house lots, and open space lands complies with the city's zoning and subdivision ordinances, particularly those sections governing the design of subdivision streets and stormwater management facilities. This requirement is meant to provide the city with assurance that the proposed plan is feasible under the current regulations of the city. The certification shall also note any waivers needed to implement the plan as drawn. 
P.  Ownership and Maintenance of Open Space. Different ownership and management options apply to the permanently protected open spaces created through the CVD development process. Such open spaces shall remain undivided and may be owned and managed by a homeowner's association, the city, or a recognized land trust or conservancy. However, in a low-density rural subdivision with ten (10) or more acres per dwelling, all or part of the required open space may be located without the house lots. Dedication of open spaces for public use, not exceeding ten (10) percent of the total parcel size, may be required by the city in order to facilitate trail connections. A narrative describing ownership, use and maintenance responsibilities shall be submitted for all common and public improvements, utilities and open spaces in a proposed CVD. 
Q.  Ownership Standards. Common open space within a CVD development shall be owned, administered and maintained by any of the following methods, either individually or in combination, and subject to approval by the planning commission. 
1.  Offer of Dedication. The city shall have the first and last offer of dedication of undivided open space in the event said land is to be conveyed. Dedication shall take the form of a conveyance of fee simple title to the open space. The city may, but shall not be required to accept undivided open space, provided: 
a.  Such land is accessible to the residents of the subdivision; 
b.  There is no cost of acquisition other than any cost incidental to the transfer of ownership, such as title insurance or deed recording fees; and 
c.  The residents of the subdivision agree to and have access to maintain such land; 
d.  Where the residents of the subdivision accept dedication of common open space that contains improvements, the residents may require the posting of financial security to ensure structural integrity of said improvements as well as the functioning of said improvements for a term not to exceed eighteen (18) months from the date of acceptance of dedication. The amount of financial security shall not exceed fifteen (15) percent of the actual cost of installation of said improvements. 
2.  Homeowners' Association. The undivided open space and associated facilities may be held in common ownership by a homeowners' association. The association shall be formed and operated under the following provisions: 
a.  The developer shall provide a description of the association, including its by laws and methods for maintaining open spaces. 
b.  The association shall be organized by the developer and shall be operated with a financial subsidy from the developer before the sale of any lots within the development. 
c.  Membership in the association is automatic (mandatory) for all purchasers of homes in the subdivision and their successors in interest. The conditions and timing of transfer of control of the association from developer to homeowners shall be established by the developer. 
d.  The association shall be responsible for maintenance taxes on undivided open spaces. The association may place liens on the subdivision property of the members who fail to pay their association dues in a timely manner. Such liens may include the imposition of penalties and interest charges. 
e.  The members of the association shall share equitably in the cost of maintaining and developing open spaces. Shares shall be defined within the association by laws. 
f.  In the event of a proposed transfer of open space land by the homeowners' association within the methods herein permitted, notice of such action shall be given to all property owners within the subdivision. 
g.  The association shall provide adequate staff to administer common facilities and property and continually maintain open spaces. 
h.  The homeowners' association may lease open spaces to any other qualified person or corporation, for operation and maintenance of such open spaces, but such a lease agreement shall provide: 
i.  That the residents of the development shall at all times have access to the open spaces contained therein, except croplands during the growing season; 
ii.  That the open spaces to be leased shall be maintained for the purpose set forth in this chapter; 
iii.  That the operation of open space facilities may be for the benefit of the residents only, or may be open to nonresidents of the subdivision, at the election of the developer and/or homeowner's association, as the case may be; and 
iv.  That the lease shall be subject to the approval of the governing body of the homeowners' association and any transfer or assignment of the lease shall be further subject to the approval of the said board. 
v.  Lease agreements so entered upon shall be recorded in the Newton County deed records within thirty (30) days of their execution, and a copy of the recorded lease shall be filed with the city. 
R.  Condominiums. Open spaces and associated facilities may be controlled through the use of condominium agreements approved by the residents of the subdivision. Such agreements shall be in conformance with the Georgia Condominium Act, O.C.G.A. Sections 44-3-70, et seq. All open space land shall be held as a "common element" as provided in said statute. 
S.  Dedication of Easements. The residents of the subdivision may, but shall not be required to, dedicate easements for public use of any portion or portions of open space land, title to which shall remain in ownership by condominium or homeowners' association, provided: 
1.  Such land is accessible to subdivision residents; 
2.  There is no cost of acquisition other than any cost incidental to the conveyance of such easements, such as recording fees; and 
3.  A satisfactory maintenance agreement is reached between the developer, condominium or homeowners' association, and the city. 
T.  Transfer of Easements to a Private Conservation Organization. With the permission of the residents of the subdivision, the developer may convey easements to a private, nonprofit organization, among whose purposes it is to conserve open space, provided that: 
1.  The organization is acceptable to the residents of the subdivision, and is a bona fide conservation organization with perpetual existence; 
2.  The conveyance contains appropriate provisions for proper reversion or retransfer in the event that the organization becomes unwilling or unable to continue carrying out its functions; and 
3.  A maintenance agreement acceptable to the governing body of the homeowners' association is entered into by the developer and the organization. 
U.  Maintenance Standards. 
1.  The ultimate owner of an open space, (typically a homeowners' association), shall be responsible for raising all funds required for operation, maintenance, and physical improvement to the open space through annual dues or special assessments. The homeowners' association shall be authorized under its by laws to place liens on subdivision property of residents who fall delinquent in payment of such dues or assessments. 
2.  In the event that the association or any successor organization shall, at any time after establishment of a development containing an open space, fail to maintain the open space in reasonable condition in accordance with the development plan, the city may proceed with the enforcement provisions established in Sections 8.04.130 through 8.04.180 of this code. 
(Ord. dated 6/30/08 (part)) 
14.32.020 - Wetlands protection overlay zoning district. 
A.  The mayor and council of the city find that the wetlands within the city are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion and soil quality. Wetlands provide habitat areas for aquatic and other wildlife; unique vegetation; water quality maintenance; pollution, flood and erosion control; and educational and recreational opportunities. Wise management of the wetlands within the city is necessary to the economic welfare of the city. It is, therefore, appropriate for the city to provide by ordinance for the protection of wetlands from alterations or uses that will negatively affect their primary functions of water quality enhancement, flood and erosion control, ground water recharge, wildlife habitat and aesthetic appeal. 
B.  Wetlands Protection District. This is an overlay use district which shall include all wetlands located within the city as shown on the wetland map, as well as land in the city within fifty (50) feet from any boundary of such wetlands, all as indicated on the city's official wetlands map. 
C.  Uses Allowed Without Permit. The following uses shall be allowed in the wetland protection district as a matter of right without obtaining a development permit, provided they are otherwise lawful and do not require grading, filling, drainage, dredging or the erection of any structure, except as provided herein: 
1.  Conservation of soil, water, vegetation, aquatic and other wildlife, provided that such activities do not affect waters of Georgia or the United States in a manner that would require a Section 404 permit; 
2.  Outdoor passive research, educational and recreational activities, including fishing, observation of wildlife, hiking, boating, horseback riding and canoeing; 
3.  Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the Georgia Forestry Commission and as specified in Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (33 USC Section 1344); 
4.  Cultivation of agricultural crops in conformity with best management practices approved by the Georgia Department of Agriculture; 
5.  Pasturing of livestock, provided that riparian wetlands are protected, that soil profiles are not disturbed and that best management practices approved by the Georgia Department of Agriculture are followed. 
D.  Permit Requirements. It is unlawful to engage in any development activity within the boundaries of a wetlands protection district without first obtaining a permit for such activity from the city's planning and zoning department. Prior to the issuance of any permit for development activity within the fifty (50) foot setback area adjacent to wetlands an applicant must furnish the following: 
1.  A U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination pursuant to the provisions of the Clean Air Act (33 USC Section 1344) and, where required thereunder, a Section 404 permit; and 
2.  A site plan, drawn at a scale of one inch equals fifty (50) feet, containing the following information: 
a.  A map of all planned excavation and fill, including calculations of the volume of cut and fill involved, cross sectional drawings showing existing and proposed grades. Elevations horizontal scale and vertical scale must be shown on the cross sectional drawings, 
b.  Location of any wetland boundaries occurring within the site, 
c.  Location, dimensions and area of all impervious surfaces, both existing and proposed, on the site and adjacent to the site for a distance of fifty (50) feet, 
d.  The orientation and distance from the boundaries of the proposed site to the nearest bank of an affected perennial stream or water body, 
e.  Elevations of the site and adjacent lands within two hundred (200) feet of the site at contour intervals of no greater than two feet; and no greater than one-foot for slopes less than or equal to two percent, 
f.  Location and detailed design of any spill and leak collection systems designed for the purpose of containing accidentally released hazardous or toxic materials, 
g.  All proposed temporary disruptions or diversions of local hydrology; 
3.  Certification by a Georgia registered professional engineer that the following post-development conditions will prevail at the site: 
a.  The rate of stormwater runoff from the site, including volume and peak runoff, will not exceed predevelopment conditions, 
b.  The amount of phosphorus, nitrogen, zinc and lead carried within the stormwater runoff will not exceed predevelopment conditions, 
c.  Biological oxygen demand and turbidity will not exceed predevelopment levels; 
4.  An application fee in an amount adopted from time to time by resolution of the mayor and council to cover evaluation of the application. Additional application fees, as adopted from time to time by resolution of the mayor and council, may be assessed where deemed necessary by the city to retain expert consultants to provide services reasonably required for evaluation of technical aspects of the site plan.

(Prior code § 6-50) 
15.16.020 - Definitions. 
As used in this chapter: 
"Fire partition" means a wall or common floor/ceiling which serves to resist the spread of fire, but does not qualify as a fire wall; however, a fire wall does qualify as a fire partition. The continuity of the fire partition shall extend from the top of the foundation to the roof/ceiling assembly or through the floor/ceiling assembly to the underside of the roof deck. If any areas are not continuous, then fire blocking meeting the then-current International Building Code specifications shall be installed. 
"Fire resistance rating" means the aggregate of the fire-resistance ratings of construction material used in a fire wall or fire partition, all as established by the National Fire Protection Association Standard 220. 
"Fire wall" means a wall of noncombustible construction having protected openings, which subdivides a building into separate areas and into separate buildings to restrict the spread of fire and which extends from the foundation of any such building continuously through all stories to and above the roof of any said building, except where the roof is of fire-resistant construction and the wall extends tightly against the underside of the roof slab thereof. In residential units protected by an automatic sprinkler system in accordance with the provisions of Section 15.20.050 of this code, a fire wall shall extend from the foundation of such building through all stories and shall fit tight against the underside of the roof slab.

Provided however, if the dwelling units are protected by an automatic sprinkler system in accordance with Section 15.24.050 of this code, the fire wall separating each individual dwelling unit shall have a fire-resistance rating of not less than one hour. 
(Ord. dated 4/2/12, § 3; Prior code § 6-52)

B.  In all multiple-family dwelling units of more than one story, there shall be a fire wall having a fire-resistance rating of not less than four hours so that the dwelling unit will be separated into areas not to exceed four thousand (4,000) square feet of floor area between end walls and fire walls or between fire walls. Thus, a multistory apartment building containing more than four thousand (4,000) square feet of floor area, but less than eight thousand (8,000) square feet would need at least one fire wall. 
C.  In multiple-family dwelling units of one story, there shall be a fire wall having a fire-resistance rating of not less than four hours so that the dwelling unit will be separated into areas not to exceed three thousand (3,000) square feet of floor area between end walls and fire walls or between fire walls.

(Ord. dated 12/20/10, § 9; Ord. dated 3/15/10, § 1; Ord. dated 4/6/04, §§ 3—7; Ord. dated 10/1/01, §§ 2, 3; prior code § 6-43) 
15.36.040 - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control. 
A.  General Provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not excluded by this chapter shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion and sediment control measures. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion and sediment control plans. Soil erosion and sediment control measures shall conform to the requirements of this chapter. The application of measures shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion and sediment pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity. 
B.  Minimum requirements, BMPs. 
1.  Best management practices as set forth in this section shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director, or to any other allegation of noncompliance with subsection (B)(2) of this section, or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to Section 15.36.070(D). As used in this subsection, the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the Manual for Sediment and Erosion Control in Georgia published by the State Water and Soil Conservation Commission as of January first of the year in which the land-disturbing activity is permitted. 
2.  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or by the division or of any general permit for construction activities issued by the division pursuant to Section 15.36.070(D) for each day on which such discharge results in turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than twenty-five (25) nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten (10) nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This subsection shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not a part of a common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
3.  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or by the division, or of any general permit for construction activities issued by the division pursuant to Section 15.36.070(D) for each day on which such failure occurs. 
4.  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land-disturbing activities occur. 
5.  The city may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subparagraphs 15. and 16. of subsection (C) of this Section 15.36.040, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
C.  Requirements. The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to this chapter for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as January first of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
1.  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion. 
2.  Cut-fill operation must be kept to a minimum. 
3.  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practical erosion potential. 
4.  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented. 
5.  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum. 
6.  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable. 
7.  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development. 
8.  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control measures shall be installed as soon as practicable. 
9.  To the extent necessary, sediment in runoff water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this subsection, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought into a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of this chapter. 
10.  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping surface of fills. 
11.  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property. 
12.  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners. 
13.  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible and provided, in any such case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum. 
14.  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion and sedimentation control shall include provisions for control or treatment of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent streams beyond the levels specified in subsection (B)(2) of this section. 
15.  Except as provided in subsection (C)(16) of this section, there is established a twenty-five (25) foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8 or where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term, "ephemeral stream" means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, provided, however, the buffers of at least twenty-five (25) feet established pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-453(a)(1) shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. 
b.  Once land-disturbing activity is initiated and continuing until final stabilization of the site is achieved, the boundary of the buffer shall be designated by four foot orange safety fencing. 
c.  Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his own occupancy may thin or trim in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed. 
d.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within twenty-five (25) degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than fifty (50) feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines. 
16.  There is established a fifty-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any trout streams, as defined in Section 15.36.020 of this chapter, except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of twenty-five (25) gallons per minute or less shall have a twenty-five-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented. The requirements set forth in subsection (C)(15) shall also apply to such buffer. The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within twenty-five (25) degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than fifty (50) feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines. 
D.  Right to Exceed Minimum Requirements. Nothing contained in this chapter shall prevent the local issuing authority from adopting rules, regulations, ordinances or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements set forth in subsections (B) and (C) of this section. 
E.  No Presumption of Violation. The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to property of another shall neither constitute proof nor create a presumption of violation of the standards provided for in this section or the terms of the permit. 
(Ord. dated 12/20/10, § 10; Ord dated 11/2/09, § 2; Ord. dated 4/6/04, §§ 8—13; Ord. dated 2/17/03, § 1; Ord. dated 10/1/01, § 4; prior code § 6-44) 
15.36.050 - Application/permit process. 
A.  Generally. The landowner, developer and designated planners and engineer shall review the general development plans and detailed plans of the issuing authority (if any have been previously submitted and approved) that affect the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall review the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, subdivision ordinance, this article, and other ordinances which regulate the development of land within the boundaries of the issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
B.  Application Requirements. 
1.  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the city without first obtaining a permit from the city engineering department to perform such activity and providing a copy of the notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
2.  The application for a permit shall be submitted by the property owner to the local issuing authority (through the engineering department) and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection C of this section. Soil erosion and sedimentation control plans shall conform to the provisions of Section 15.36.040 of this chapter. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by three copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan or that such a visit was not required in accordance with the rules and regulations established by the board. 
3.  A fee, in an amount set by the city council, shall be charged for each acre and/or fraction of an acre in the project area. 
4.  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 112-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed eighty dollars ($80.00) per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. Half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to paragraph (9) or (10) of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17 shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within thirty-five (35) days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within thirty-five (35) days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
5.  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the Upper Ocmulgee Soil and Water Conservation for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion and sediment control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within thirty-five (35) days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within thirty-five (35) days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district and any variances required by Section 15.36.040(C)(16) and (17) and bonding, if required as per subsection (B)(6) of this section have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. 
6.  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this article, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing of the application under consideration, the issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
7.  The city may require the permit applicant to furnish security for satisfactory completion of any land-disturbing activity in the form of a cash deposit, a performance bond issued by a surety approved by the city or an irrevocable letter of credit issued by a financial institution approved by the city, or any combination thereof within the city's sole discretion, in the minimum amount of three thousand dollars ($3,000.00) per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuance of the permit. Such security will not be released until a notice of termination has been submitted to the Georgia Environmental Protection Division and/or a certificate of occupancy for the project has been issued by the city. Simultaneously with submission of a notice of intent or notice of termination to the Georgia Environmental Protection Division a copy of same shall be filed in the engineering department office of the city. If the applicant does not comply with the provisions of this chapter or with the conditions of the permit, the city may make appropriate demand on the security and may use the proceeds of such security to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of such activity, including removal of any silt fence remaining on said site, and bring the site into compliance with the provisions of this chapter and any applicable state or federal regulations. For developments requiring the filing of a notice of intent for compliance with a Georgia National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit, the city may require the sampling of additional 0.5-inch and greater rain events and the filing of the results of such sampling in the engineering department office of the city. All land-disturbing permits issued under the provisions of this chapter shall expire on the first anniversary of the date of issuance, and must be renewed on or before each anniversary date thereafter to remain effective. Land-disturbing permits issued for developments in which land-disturbing activity has been dormant for six months or longer will thereupon become null, void and of no effect. 
C.  Plan Requirements. 
1.  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements contained in Section 15.36.040. Conformance with the minimum requirements may be attained through the use of design criteria in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia, revised in 1989, published by the State Soil and Water Conservation Commission as a guide or through the use of alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is incorporated by reference into this chapter. 
The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types; geological and hydrological characteristics; topography; watershed; vegetation; proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and stormwater management facilities; local ordinances and state laws. 
2.  Data Required for Site Plan. Data required for the site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January first of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
3.  Supportive Data. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature/seal of a Georgia-registered or certified professional in engineering, architecture, landscape architecture, land surveying or erosion and sedimentation control. After December 31, 2006, all persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring or inspection or any land-disturbing activity shall meet the education and certification requirements as developed by the conservation commission pursuant to the provisions of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. The certified plans shall contain: 
a.  Graphic scale and north point or arrow indicating magnetic north. 
b.  Vicinity maps showing location of project and existing streets.

h.  Delineate the twenty-five (25) foot horizontal buffer adjacent to state waters and the specified width in MRPA areas. 
i.  Delineate the specified horizontal buffer along designated trout streams, where applicable. 
j.  Location of erosion and sedimentation control measures and practices using coding symbols from the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia, Chapter 6. 
k.  Location of erosion and sediment control practices, preferably using uniform coding symbols from the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia, Chapter 6. Practices may include, but are not limited to: 
i.  Construction exit; 
ii.  Sediment barrier; 
iii.  Sediment basin; 
iv.  Grassed waterway (open swale); and 
v.  Storm drain outlet protection. 
4.  Maintenance. Maintenance of all soil erosion and sedimentation control practices, whether temporary or permanent, shall be at all times the responsibility of the owner. 
D.  Permits. 
1.  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable, but in any event not later than forty-five (45) days after receipt by the issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary. 
2.  No permit shall be issued by the issuing authority unless the erosion and sedimentation control plan has been approved by the district and the issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this chapter, any variances required by Section 15.36.040(B)(16) of this chapter are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per subsection (B)(6) of this section are met and all ordinances, rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
3.  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
4.  The permit may be suspended, revoked or modified by the issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or is in violation of this chapter. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
(Ord. dated 12/20/10, §§ 11—16; Ord. dated 3/1/10, § 2; Ord. dated 8/5/08, § 1; Ord. dated 4/6/04, §§ 14—20; Ord. dated 2/17/03, §§ 2, 3; prior code § 6-45) 
15.36.060 - Inspection and enforcement. 
A.  The city's engineering department technician, the building and zoning department and the environmental protection division will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate both primary and secondary permittees, as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities, as defined herein, has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions or with the provisions of this chapter, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to timely comply with the terms of such notice, he shall be deemed to be in violation of this chapter. 
B.  The city's engineering department, engineering technician and the building and zoning department shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this article, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities. 
C.  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the issuing authority, the conservation commission, the district or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
(Ord. dated 12/20/10, § 17; Ord. dated 4/6/04, § 21; prior code § 6-46) 
15.36.070 - Penalties and incentives. 
A.  Failure to Obtain a Permit for Land-Disturbing Activity. If any person commences any land-disturbing activity requiring a land-disturbing permit as prescribed in this chapter without first obtaining said permit, the person shall be subject to revocation of his business license, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a business and associated work activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the issuing authority. 
B.  Work Orders. The following procedures shall apply to the issuance of stop work orders: 
1.  For the first violation of the provisions of this chapter, the issuing authority shall issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have three consecutive calendar days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within three consecutive calendar days, the issuing authority shall issue a stop work order requiring that land-disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided, however, that if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land-disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order in lieu of a warning. 
2.  For each subsequent violation, the director or the city shall issue an immediate stop work order; and 
3.  All stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall remain in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. 
4.  If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities is not in compliance with BMPs, the deposit of any silt or sediment into state waters is an automatic violation subject to a stop-work order and citation. 
5.  When a violation in the form of taking action without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer, or significant amounts of sediment, as determined by the local issuing authority or by the director or his designee, have been or are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained, a stop work order shall be issued by the local issuing authority or by the director or his designee. All such stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop work orders shall apply to all land-disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls. 
C.  Bond Forfeiture. If, though inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities has failed to comply with the approved plan, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to have forfeited his performance bond, if required to post one under the provisions of Section 15.36.050(B)(6). The issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. 
D.  Monetary Penalties. 
1.  For the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this chapter, pursuant to the provisions of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-15, the municipal court shall be authorized to impose a penalty not to exceed two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00 for each violation. Each day during which a violation or failure or refusal to comply continues shall be a separate violation. 
2.  Any person who violates any provisions of the ordinance codified in this chapter, or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant to this chapter, or who negligently or intentionally fails or refuses to comply with any final or emergency order of the director issued as provided in this chapter shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) per day. For the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this chapter, notwithstanding any provisions in the city charter or this code to the contrary, the municipal court of the city shall be authorized to impose a penalty not to exceed two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) for each violation. Each day during which violation or failure or refusal to comply continues shall be a separate violation.

D.  Rules for Interpretation. 
1.  Zoning of Streets, Alleys, Public Ways, State Highways, Interstate Highways and Railroad Rights-of-Way. All streets, alleys, public ways, state highways, interstate highways and railroad rights-of-way; if not otherwise specifically designated, shall be deemed to be the same zoning designation as the property immediately abutting upon such alleys, streets, public ways, and railroad rights-of-way. Where the centerline of a street, alley, public way, state highway, interstate highway or railroad right-of-way serves as a district boundary, the zoning of such areas, unless otherwise specifically designated, shall be deemed to be the same as that of the abutting property up to such center line. 
2.  Where the planning and zoning director determines that uncertainty exists with respect to the location of the boundaries of any zoning district as set forth on the official zoning map, the following rules shall apply: 
A.  Where possible, a rezoning file, which includes a correct legal description and minutes of the mayor and council public hearing shall be used for delineating zoning boundaries. 
B.  Where a zoning district boundary line is shown as approximately following a corporate limits line, a militia district line, a land lot line, a lot line or the center line of a street, a city road, a state highway, an interstate highway, or a railroad right-of-way or such lines extended, then such lines shall be construed to be the zoning district boundary lines. 
C.  Where a zoning district boundary line is shown as being set back from a street, a city road, a state highway, an interstate highway, or a railroad right-of-way, and approximately parallel thereto, then such zoning district boundary line shall be construed as being at the scaled distance from the center line of the street, city road, state highway, interstate highway, or railroad right-of-way and as being parallel thereto. 
D.  Where a zoning district boundary line divides a lot, the location of the line shall be the scaled distance from the lot lines. In this situation, the requirements of the zoning district in which the greater portion of the lot lies shall apply to the balance of the lot except that such extension shall not include any part of a lot that lies more than fifty (50) feet beyond the zoning district boundary line. 
E.  In the case of a through lot fronting on two approximately parallel streets that is divided by a zoning district boundary line paralleling the streets, the restrictions of the zoning district in which each frontage of the through lot lies shall apply to that portion of the through lot. 
F.  Where zoning district boundaries are in doubt, the planning and zoning director shall make such interpretation using the appropriate scale from the official zoning map.

2.  Single-family residential; 
3.  Multifamily residential; 
4.  High density residential;

Instead, the comprehensive plan establishes broad planning policy for current and future land uses and provides, among other things, designated categories within which only certain zoning districts may be authorized. 
2.  The zoning districts that are permitted within each land use category shall be restricted to those shown in the following table. 

 
C.  Conformity of the Zoning Maps with the Comprehensive Plan.

Chapter 16.24 - OVERLAY ZONING DISTRICTS 

16.24.010 - Procedures governing overlay zoning districts. 
Application. 
A.  Overlay districts are supplemental to the underlying zoning district classifications established in the zoning ordinance that govern all properties within Covington. Within areas mapped as overlay zoning districts in this chapter, these overlay district regulations shall be overlaid upon and shall be imposed in addition to said underlying zoning regulations. 
B.  The provisions of each overlay zoning district apply to all applications for rezoning, land disturbance permits, driveway permits, plan review, plat approval, building permits, utility permits and licenses for all property and rights-of-way within the boundaries of the overlay district. 
C.  All plan reviews, plat approvals, permits and licenses for parcels located within each overlay district shall meet all of the requirements of the base zoning district in which it is located and, in addition, shall meet the requirements of the overlay zoning district applicable to the parcel. All road and utility projects shall adhere to all requirements of the overlay zoning district. 
D.  Any parcel of land that is wholly or partly within the boundary shall be included in the overlay district. 
E.  Relationship to Underlying Zoning District Standards. In any case where the standards and requirements of an overlay zoning district vary from those of the base zoning district, the standards and requirements of the overlay district shall govern. 
F.  Map Amendments. No change in the boundary of an overlay zoning district shall be authorized, except by the mayor and council pursuant to procedures in Chapter 16.12. 
G.  Overlay Zoning District Boundary Maps. Overlay zoning district boundaries shall be as established on the official zoning map. 
(Ord. dated 6/30/08 (part)) 
16.24.020 - Airport Hazard overlay zoning district. 
A.  Findings of Fact. The mayor and council of the city find that airport hazards endanger the lives and property of users of the Covington Municipal Airport and the property and occupants of land in its vicinity. Such hazards may also reduce the area available for utilization by aircraft, thus impairing the utility of the airport and the public investment therein. It is, therefore, appropriate for the city to provide by ordinance for the prevention and control of airport hazards in the interest of the public health, safety and general welfare. 
B.  Airport Zone. In order to carry out the provisions of this section, there is created and established an overlay zone incorporating all of the land lying within the approach zones, transitional zones, horizontal zones, and conical zones of the airport. Such zones are shown on the airport hazard zoning map, including the approach and profile plan maps, on file at city hall and the planning and zoning office, which map is by this reference incorporated herein and made a part hereof. Any area located in more than one zone shall be considered to be in the zone with the more restrictive height limitation. The airport zones are described as follows: 
1.  Nonprecision Instrument Approach Zone. The inner edge of this zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is five hundred (500) feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of three thousand five hundred (3,500) feet at a horizontal distance of ten thousand (10,000) feet from either end of the primary surface. Its centerline is the centerline of the runway as extended in either direction from the ends of the airport runway. 
2.  Transitional Zone. The area beneath a plane extending outward and upward at ninety (90) degree angles to the runway centerline and the extended runway centerline with a slope of seven feet horizontally for each foot vertically from the sides of the primary and approach surfaces to where they intersect the horizontal and conical planes, and extending a distance of five thousand (5,000) feet measured horizontally from the edge of the approach zones and at ninety (90) degree angles to the extended runway centerline. 
3.  Horizontal Zone. A zone delineated by arcs of five thousand (5,000) feet in radius for all runways designated as utility or visual and ten thousand (10,000) feet in radius for all others, measured from the center of each end of the primary surface of each runway and connecting the adjacent arcs by drawing lines tangent to those arcs. 
4.  Conical Zone. An area that commences at the periphery of the horizontal zone and extends outward therefrom a horizontal distance of four thousand (4,000) feet. The conical zone does not include the precision instrument approach zones or the transitional zones. 
C.  Airport Height Limitations. Except as otherwise provided in this section, no structure or tree shall be erected, altered, allowed to grow, or maintained in the space within an airport zone or otherwise to a height in excess of the applicable height limit herein established for such zone. When more than one height limitation is applicable to a single space, the more restrictive limitation shall apply. 
1.  Runway Larger than a Utility Runway with a Visibility Greater than Three-Fourths Mile Nonprecision Instrument Approach Zone. Slopes upward thirty-four (34) feet horizontally for each foot vertically beginning at the end of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of ten thousand (10,000) feet along the extended runway centerline. 
2.  Transitional Zone. One hundred fifty (150) feet above the airport elevation. 
3.  Horizontal Zone. One hundred fifty (150) feet above the airport elevation. 
4.  Conical Zone. Slopes upward and outward twenty (20) feet horizontally for each foot vertically beginning at the periphery of the horizontal zone and at one hundred fifty (150) feet above the airport elevation and extending to a height of three hundred fifty (350) feet above the airport elevation. 
5.  Military Conical Zones. Slopes upward and outward twenty (20) feet horizontally for each foot vertically beginning at the periphery of the horizontal zone for a distance of four thousand (4,000) feet. 
D.  Use Restrictions; All Zones. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, no use may be made of land or water within any zone in such a manner as to create electrical interference with navigational signals or radio communication between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for pilots to distinguish between airport lights and other lights, result in glare in the eyes of a pilot using the airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport or otherwise in any way create a hazard or endanger the landing, takeoff, or maneuvering of aircraft intending to use the airport. Subject at all times to the height restrictions set forth in subsection C, all uses made of any land in any of the zone shall comply with all of the following performance standards, as applicable: 
1.  Outdoor Lighting. No use shall project lighting directly onto an existing runway or taxiway or into existing airport approach and landing paths except where necessary for safe and convenient air travel. Lighting for any new or expanded use shall incorporate shielding in their designs to reflect light away from airport approach and landing paths. No use shall imitate airport lighting or impede the ability of pilots to distinguish between airport lighting and other lighting. 
2.  Glare. No glare producing material, including but not limited to unpainted metal or reflective glass, shall be used on the exterior of structures located within airport approach and landing paths or on nearby lands where glare could impede a pilot's vision. 
3.  Industrial Emissions. No agricultural, industrial, mining or similar use, or expansion of an existing agricultural, industrial, mining or similar use, shall, as part of its regular operations, cause emissions of smoke, dust, or steam that could obscure visibility of pilots, except upon demonstration, supported by substantial evidence, that mitigation measures imposed as approved conditions will reduce the potential for safety risk or incompatibility with airport operations to an insignificant level. The review authority shall impose such conditions as necessary to ensure that the use does not obscure visibility. 
4.  Communications Facilities and Electrical Interference. 
a.  No use shall cause or create electrical interference with navigational signals or radio communications operated on the airport or operated between an airport and aircraft. Proposals for the location of new or expanded radio, radio-telephone, and television transmission facilities and electrical transmission lines shall be coordinated with FAA prior to approval. 
b.  Approval of cellular and other telephone or radio communication towers on leased property located within the airport zones shall be conditioned to require their removal within ninety (90) days following the expiration of the lease agreement. A bond or other security shall be required to ensure this result. Proof of as-constructed height shall be required to ensure the construction of the structure was done in compliance with the submitted plans and does not exceed the heights as noted in subsection C. 
5.  Fire and Explosion Hazards. No use or structure shall promote concentrations of flammable substances or materials. 
6.  Other Hazards to Aircraft Operations. In addition to the specific prohibitions stated in this subsection D, no use or structure shall otherwise endanger the landing, taking off, or maneuvering of aircraft. 
E.  Land Uses Within Airport Hazard Zones. 
1.  Applicability. 
a.  General Rule. The land use compatibility standards of this subsection E shall apply to all properties located in the specified airport zone. This section's land use compatibility standards restrict uses that may be hazardous to the operational safety of aircraft operating to and from the Covington Municipal Airport, and to limit population and building density in the runway approach areas, avoid concentrations of people, and create sufficient open space to protect life and property in case of accident. 
b.  Applicability of Regulations to Properties Located in More than One Zone. If a single parcel is located in more than one airport zone, the applicable zone use restrictions shall apply only to the portion of the property located in that zone. For example, if a property under single ownership is located half in the nonprecision instrument approach zone and half in the horizontal zone, the half located in the nonprecision instrument approach zone is subject to the use restrictions applicable in the nonprecision instrument approach zone, and the half located in the horizontal zone is subject to the applicable the horizontal zone use restrictions. 
c.  Use Restrictions in Nonprecision Instrument Approach Zone. Subject at all times to the height restrictions set forth in subsection C and the general performance standards in subsection D, areas with the nonprecision instrument approach zone shall comply with the following use restrictions: 
i.  Public assembly uses are prohibited. "Public assembly" uses include, but are not limited to, churches, hospitals, schools, theaters, stadiums, hotels, motels, campgrounds, and other structures or outdoor facilities where concentrations of people gather for purposes such as deliberation, education, shopping, business, entertainment, amusement, sporting events or similar activities, but excluding air shows. "Public assembly" uses do not include places where people congregate for relatively short periods of time, such as parking lots, or uses approved by the FAA in an adopted airport master plan. 
ii.  Multi-family residential uses, mobile home parks, and institutional living facilities such as nursing homes and senior assisted living facilities are prohibited. 
iii.  Dwellings on parcels less than two acres in size are prohibited. 
iv.  Uses that represent significant fire or explosion hazards, including fuel storage tank farms, above-ground fuel tanks, and gasoline stations, are prohibited. 
v.  Telecommunication and radio tower structures are prohibited. 
vi.  Approvals of wind turbines and above-ground, power-generating structures shall be conditioned on whether the equipment causes any hazard to the airport due to height, electromagnetic or other interference with air traffic communications, heat plumes, or other characteristics. 
d.  Use Restrictions in Horizontal Zone. The horizontal zone shall be subject only to height restrictions set forth in subsection C and the general performance standards in subsection D. 
F.  Nonconforming Uses. 
1.  The provisions of this section shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering, or other changes or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to the said provisions as of the date of enactment of this section, or otherwise interfere with the continuance of such nonconforming use. Neither shall anything contained herein require any change in the construction, alteration, or intended use of any structure, the construction or alteration of which was begun prior to the said enactment date, and is diligently prosecuted. 
2.  Notwithstanding subsection F.1. of this section, the owner of any existing nonconforming structure or tree shall be required to permit the installation, operation, and maintenance thereon of such markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary or desirable by the airport manager in order to indicate the presence of such airport hazards to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport. Such markers and lights shall be installed, operated, and maintained at the expense of the city. 
G.  Permits. 
1.  Permit Required—Application. No material change shall be made in the use of land and no structure or tree shall be erected, altered, planted or otherwise established in any zone created unless a permit has been applied for and approved by the city planning and zoning official; provided, however, that a permit for a tree or structure of less than seventy-five (75) feet in vertical height above the ground shall not be required in the area within a horizontal distance of four thousand two hundred (4,200) feet from each end of the runway except when such tree or structure, because of terrain, land contour, or topographic features, would extend above the height limit prescribed for the applicable zone. Each application for a permit shall be made in the form prescribed by the city planning and zoning official and shall indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired, with sufficient particulars for the city planning and zoning official to determine whether the resulting use, structure, or tree would conform to the provisions of this section. 
2.  Variances. Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or use his property in a manner other than in accordance with the provisions of this section may apply to the board of appeals and adjustments for a variance from such provisions as more particularly provided in Section 16.12.160 of this title. 
H.  Administration and Enforcement. The city planning and zoning department shall have primary responsibility for administration and enforcement of the provisions of this section and shall have all requisite power and authority necessary to carry out such responsibility, including without limitation entry onto private property for inspections, issuance of administrative orders, and civil or criminal prosecution of violations of said provisions. 
I.  Penalties. Violations of the provisions of this section shall be punished as provided in Section 16.04.100 of this title. Each violation shall be a separate offense.

3.  Covington Town Center overlay zoning district. In order to carry out the provisions of this section, there is created and established an overlay zoning district (the "Covington Town Center Overlay District") incorporating all of that land described on that plat of survey recorded in the office of the clerk of the Superior Court of Newton County, Georgia, at Plat Book 51, page 104 et seq. on December 7, 2016, which plats are by this reference incorporated herein and made a part hereof. 
4.  Master Developer. The Covington Town Center, LLC, a Georgia limited liability company, shall be known as the master developer of the Covington Town Center Overlay District. The master developer, or their assign, shall remain the master developer until such time as control is transferred to a master property owners' association. Once transfer has been legally established, the master property owners' association shall provide to the city the necessary documents showing the transfer of control and shall thereafter serve as master developer. 
5.  Phasing. Each phase of development of the Covington Town Center Overlay District shall be so planned and related to the previous phases of development, surrounding property, and availability of public facilities and services so that a failure to proceed with subsequent phases of the development will have no adverse impact on the completed phase(s) or surrounding properties. 
6.  Administrative Variances. In addition to those limited minor administrative variances from certain provisions of this zoning title which the planning and zoning director may generally approve as set forth at Section 16.12.150 of this zoning title, the planning and zoning director may grant the following limited additional administrative variances from the requirements of the site development standards set forth at subsection B.3. below and of the community development requirements set forth at subsection C below: 
a.  Any modification of the site development standards set forth at subsection B.3. below which does not exceed ten (10) percent of the requirement; provided that any requested modification of a setback where a property adjoining the setback is not included within the Covington Town Center Overlay District shall be subject to Section 16.12.150. 
b.  Any modification of the vegetative buffer requirements of the Community Development Requirements set forth at subsection C below; provided that any requested modification of a vegetative buffer where a property adjoining the vegetated buffer is not included within the Covington Town Center Overlay District shall be subject to Section 16.12.150. 
7.  Conceptual Development Plan. 
a.  Conceptual Development Plan Intent. The conceptual development plan establishes a general framework of areas within the Covington Town Center Overlay District that will be open to the public (public streets, open spaces, etc.) and those areas which will be private mixed use development blocks. The conceptual development plan, which was prepared by Thomas & Hutton Engineering, dated December 1, 2016 as modified July 3, 2018 and included in to the July 23, 2018 City Council meeting minutes, is available for inspection at the office of the planning and zoning director. 
b.  Modification to the Conceptual Development Plan. Deviation from the conceptual development plan may be necessary in the future. Deviations related to the development block pattern and public street layout may be approved by the planning and zoning director provided strict compliance with the conceptual development plan would cause undue and unnecessary hardship to the intent and the continued integrity of the Covington Town Center Overlay District. Deviations from the conceptual development plan modifying the location of proposed uses or conflicting with conditions of zoning shall require approval by the city council following recommendation of the planning commission. 
8.  General Provisions.

Townhouses, and multi-family buildings shall only be allowed within the residential areas shown on the conceptual development plan dated July 3, 2018. Residential-Above-Commercial shall be allowed in all areas. If the three hundred fifty (350) unit cap is reached without using all the area shown as residential, the remaining undeveloped area shall revert to non-residential/mixed-use classification. 
a.  Townhouse dwellings shall be subject to the supplemental use provisions of Section 16.20.255. 
b.  Multifamily dwellings shall be subject to items A.4 through A.12 of the supplemental use provisions of Section 16.20.250. 
c.  Residential-Above-Commercial. The following shall apply to all residential above commercial:

d.  Multifamily, Residential-Above-Commercial, and Non-Residential Development Standards. 

 
[1] Setbacks on side yard shall not be required on buildings that are planned to be constructed as a contiguous group of buildings. 
3.  Residential streets. As a planned development, all streets, drives, and alleys serving townhouse and multifamily buildings shall be designed and constructed to minimum city street standards, however said streets, drives, and alleys shall not be dedicated as public infrastructure and all maintenance and improvements shall be the responsibility of the master developer. All streets, drives, and alleys shall contain utility easements providing the utility owners and their designees the right and ability to perform necessary maintenance and improvements within said easements. 
4.  Open Space. The Covington Town Center Overlay District shall not have less than twenty (20) percent community open space as defined at Section 16.08.010. Individual developments or phases within the Covington Town Center Overlay District may be less than twenty (20) percent as long as the master developer, or its designated successor, provides the city with a notarized letter in conjunction with the development of such development or phase stating that the twenty (20) percent open space minimum will be provided within the entire Covington Town Center Overlay District and the planning and zoning director determines that such open space requirement is capable of being achieved. 
The open space shown on the conceptual development plan is intended to be maintained in a natural but aesthetically pleasing way. The trails and pond areas shown are to be considered both a necessary infrastructure improvement, as well as, an amenity to be enjoyed by visitors of the property. In this regards, typical requirements for perimeter fencing around the ponds areas shall not be required. While the route may differ upon final design, the trail intent that is shown on the conceptual development plan shall be constructed along with the development of the mass grading and roadway infrastructure improvements. 
5.  Landscape and Buffers. The landscape plantings within the Covington Town Center Overlay District shall utilize the city's community tree species list for determining appropriate species for each tree size category. Relative size designations in this subsection 3 shall have the meaning ascribed in such list. 
6.  Exterior Roads and Perimeter Buffers. Where development is adjacent to Alcovy Road, City Pond Road or Highway 142, or any other perimeter property lines of the overlay district, a buffer, as defined at Section 16.40.020, twenty (20) feet in width shall be required along the length of the tract. The buffer shall also serve as a development setback. The intent of the buffer is to provide a visual softening, not complete screening, of the development in relationship to exterior properties. 
a.  In addition to the permitted screening items at Section 16.40.020, the exterior road and perimeter buffer may include visual screening, utilities, stormwater management/conveyance, and signage. 
b.  Such buffers shall not include parking or buildings. 
c.  A continuous planting of evergreen shrubs shall be required anywhere parking is visible from the adjacent exterior roads and perimeter properties. Such plantings shall be of a species that is capable of being maintained at thirty-six-inch minimum height within one year of plantings. A brick, stone or other similar material wall thirty-six (36) inches in height may be provided instead of the plantings as an alternate compliance. 
d.  Two large or medium species trees shall be included for every one hundred (100) feet of buffer length. For areas that have overhead utility conflicts that do not allow for planting large or medium species trees, four small trees for every one hundred (100) feet of buffer length shall be provided. 
e.  The preservation of existing vegetation is desirous and where sufficient amounts exist, no supplement plantings are required. For those areas with sparse vegetation supplemental plantings shall be required at the rate listed in subsections C and D above. 
7.  Internal Road Buffers. Where development is adjacent to an internal public road, a vegetative buffer ten (10) feet in width shall be required along the length of the tract. The buffer shall also serve as a development setback. A roadway cross-section with an example of this buffer, prepared by Thomas & Hutton Engineering and dated November, 2016, is available for inspection at the office of the planning and zoning director. 
a.  In addition to the permitted screening items at Section 16.40.020, the interior road buffer may include visual screening, utilities, stormwater management/conveyance, and signage. 
b.  Such buffers shall not include parking or buildings. 
c.  A continuous planting of evergreen shrubs shall be required anywhere parking is visible from an internal public road. Such plantings shall be of a species that is capable of being maintained at thirty-six-inch minimum height within one year of plantings. A brick, stone or other similar material wall thirty-six (36) inches in height may be provided instead of the plantings as an alternate compliance. 
d.  The internal roads will be designed to include street trees at a maximum of fifty (50) feet on center within the road right-of-way. Therefore, there is not a requirement to include trees within the ten-foot internal road buffers. 
e.  Street tree species shall not be mono-specie or mono-cultured when greater than six trees are planted. 
f.  Streetlights shall meet light levels defined by ANSI/IES standard RP-8-14 for medium collector roadways with R3 pavement classification. All roadway lighting systems shall be installed in accordance with the National Electric Safety Code (NESC) using wiring methods, poles and fixtures approved by the city of Covington Electric Department. 
8.  Parking Area Plantings. Parking within side, rear or front building setback areas shall be allowed. However, no parking shall occur within the required buffer areas. The following additional planting standards apply to all parking areas: 
a.  All parking areas shall have tree islands and parking lot perimeter planting areas adequately sized in order to provide a minimum of one tree for every seven parking spaces. Further, tree islands shall be provided at the end of all parking rows and in no case shall a parking space be greater than one hundred sixty-five (165) feet away from a tree. 
b.  Tree islands shall be ten-foot minimum width of plantable area. However, if a minimum of one hundred (100) square feet of pervious pavement is provided in the immediately adjacent parking spaces, this width may be reduced to five-foot-wide minimum. Depending on the design of the parking area, additional width may be necessary to meet the minimum permeable surface area requirements based on the tree size as listed in the tree canopy coverage section below. 
c.  Trees planted within parking areas shall consist of overstory trees chosen from the large species and medium species trees identified in the Covington Community Tree Species List. 
d.  A minimum of seventy (70) percent of the plantable area shall be covered with groundcover, sod, shrubs or other living plants. Large areas of mulch only will not be permitted. 
e.  Landscape strips separating head-to-head parking are encouraged to improve the aesthetics of an expansive parking area, to allow for bio-retention opportunities and to allow another opportunities for tree plantings to reduce the heat island effect, however, they are not required. 
9.  Tree Canopy Coverage. The overall Covington Town Center Overlay District shall meet a forty-five (45) percent tree canopy coverage. This standard shall apply to the entire overlay district and not on a parcel by parcel or development by development basis. However, no individual project shall provide less than ten (10) percent tree canopy coverage. Due to the nature of the site and the amount of grading that is expected, the majority of this requirement will be met through plant back on site. Therefore, there is not a minimum amount of existing tree canopy preservation that is required. The following additional planting standards apply to all areas of the site: 
a.  The permeable surface area required shall be: 
i.  Large tree—Two hundred (200) square feet. 
ii.  Medium tree—One hundred fifty (150) square feet. 
iii.  Small tree—One hundred (100) square feet. 
iv.  Very small tree—Fifty (50) square feet.

iv.  Very small canopy trees—Twenty-five (25) percent maximum. 
10.  Service Areas, Utilities and Loading Docks. 
a.  Location. Refuse areas, storage, loading and commercial vehicle parking shall be located in a manner to minimize being visible from streets, sidewalks, trails and other pedestrian oriented amenities and infrastructure. 
b.  Dumpsters. 
i.  All dumpsters shall be screened from public view on three sides by a masonry wall enclosure that is a minimum of eight feet in height. The fourth side shall provide access by an opaque steel gate. 
ii.  The materials and paint color of the enclosure and gate shall be compatible with the principle structure it is an accessory to. 
iii.  Bollards shall be placed along the interior walls of the enclosure to prevent damage during servicing of the dumpster. 
iv.  Dumpsters shall be placed on concrete pads of sufficient size and strength to support the weight of service vehicles. 
v.  Restaurants and other food service establishments shall place dumpsters on concrete pads that are designed to slope into a drain that is equipped with a grease trap.

c.  Minimum drive aisle widths will vary based on the angle of parking spaces, one-way versus two-way traffic, etc. 
i.  One-way traffic—45-degree parking, 15-foot aisle width. 
ii.  One-way traffic—60-degree parking, 18-foot aisle width. 
iii.  Two-way traffic—60-degree parking, 24-foot aisle width. 
iv.  Two-way traffic—90-degree parking, 24-foot aisle width. 
d.  Maximum Parking Spaces by Type of Development. 
i.  Residential. Maximum of two parking spaces per bedroom 
ii.  Non-Residential. 

 
[1] For developments or buildings that contain multiple uses, the maximum number of allowed spaces shall be calculated based on the percentage of use proposed. Example: A use that has retail sales as well as a full service restaurant option would be considered both commercial/retail parking and restaurant parking. 
e.  The request to construct additional parking spaces above the maximum allowed shall first be made in writing to the master developer, or its designated successor. Following review by the master developer or its successor, or if the master developer or its designated successor does not respond within thirty (30) days, the request shall then be reviewed by the director of planning and zoning upon written application and proof of notice to the master developer. The director of planning and zoning may authorize an increase in the total number of parking spaces permitted as specified in subsection C of Section 16.44.010. 
f.  To the extent practical, parking rows shall be oriented perpendicular to business fronts allowing pedestrians to circulate down the drive lanes and a minimum of one accessible route shall be provided from the public entries of uses to an adjacent public right-of-way. 
g.  Parking areas shall be screened and planted as required elsewhere within this section. 
h.  Parking area lighting may be installed by the end user or leased by the city of Covington Utilities installed in accordance with the National Electric Code (NEC) or the National Electric Safety Code (NESC), respectively. At a minimum, parking area lighting shall meet light levels as defined by ANSI/IES standard RP-20-14. 
12.  Outdoor lighting. Outdoor lighting shall incorporate shielding in their designs to reflect light away from adjacent properties and streets. Due to the proximity to the Covington Municipal Airport, no use shall imitate airport lighting or impede the ability of pilots to distinguish between airport lighting and other lighting. 
D.  Signage. All signage shall follow the allowed signage and standards of Chapter 16.48, signs for approval processes. The following standards shall apply to the signage within the Covington Town Center Overlay: 
1.  Ground Signs Along Public Streets. 
a.  One sign structure per road frontage per parcel of up to forty (40) square feet per sign face, with an aggregate total of each sign not to exceed eighty (80) square feet for the first two hundred (200) linear feet of parcel road frontage. For each one hundred (100) linear feet of additional road frontage, twenty (20) additional square feet of sign face is allowed per sign face. However, no sign shall exceed a maximum of eighty (80) square feet per sign face (aggregate total of each sign not to exceed one hundred sixty (160) square feet) for any given sign. Each sign shall have a maximum height of eight (8) feet and a minimum setback of ten (10) feet.

g.  A temporary construction sign shall be defined as a sign placed upon any parcel pursuant to this provision of this subsection regardless of the content or message displayed upon such sign. 
E.  Buildings and Building Design. Unless otherwise provided in this Section, the following regulations shall apply to all non-residential buildings in the Covington Town Center Overlay District: 
1.  Building Materials and Design. 
a.  No exterior wall or facade of any building visible from any public street shall have the appearance of a metal building. Such exterior walls and facades shall be constructed of brick, glass, wood, stucco, stone or cement-based siding. 
b.  Building materials for facades of buildings oriented to public streets shall be constructed of brick, stone (natural or artificial), textured concrete masonry units, wood, stucco, cement-based siding, or glass. Polyvinyl chloride building products are prohibited. 
2.  Orientation of Building. 
a.  Delineation of building floors at the third story above sidewalk level and lower shall be executed through windows, belt courses, cornice lines or similar architectural detailing. 
b.  All buildings shall have their primary facade oriented substantially towards the main public streets or internal private drives or streets to which the building relates and is adjacent. Buildings located on outparcels situated between two streets, whether public or private, may orient the primary facade toward either such street provided that the other facades that are visible from a public street shall be architecturally compatible with the primary facade. 
c.  The primary pedestrian access to all sidewalk level uses and business establishments with public or private street frontage, or parking lot frontage shall be directly accessible and visible from the sidewalk adjacent to such street or parking lot. 
d.  No barbed wire, razor wire, chain link fence or similar elements shall be visible from any public plaza, ground level or sidewalk level outdoor dining area or public right-of-way. 
3.  Building Scale. 
a.  Discontinuous Building Massing. Every building shall reduce its perceived height and bulk by dividing the building mass into smaller scale components. Building walls exceeding one hundred (100) continuous horizontal linear feet shall utilize offsets, such as projections, recesses, and changes in floor level, to add architectural interest and variety, and to relieve the negative visual effect of a simple long wall. 
b.  Variation in Building Silhouettes. Variation in the roofline of buildings and offsets in pitched roofs and gables shall be required. Parapets in building masses exceeding one hundred (100) continuous linear feet shall be varied in height and projection and shall use decorative elements such as crown moldings, dental, brick soldier courses, or similar detail. 
4.  Storefront Requirements for Non-residential and Mixed-use Buildings. 
a.  Where there are ground floor nonresidential uses within a mixed use building, non-residential use shall be provided for a minimum depth of twenty (20) feet from any building facade abutting a sidewalk that is accessible to the public whether it is on a public street or within a development that is open to the public. 
b.  The length of facade without intervening fenestration, architectural detailing or entryway shall not exceed thirty (30) feet. 
c.  All building facades that contain a public entrance shall include fenestration into their design. The minimum square feet of fenestration shall be equivalent to sixty-five (65) percent of the length of the façade in which the public entrance is located. A maximum of fifteen (15) percent of provided fenestration treatment shall be permitted to utilize architectural detailing in place of glass to meet the fenestration treatment requirements. All fenestration treatments shall be visually and architecturally consistent and compatible with each other. The director of planning and zoning may consider fenestration amounts that differ from the standards above based upon the use, visibility from public areas, and other architectural treatments proposed on the structure. 
Example: A non-residential building has two facades that each contain a public entrance, the primary facade is six hundred eighty-five (685) linear feet and the secondary façade is one hundred fifty (150) linear feet. The primary façade shall contain 445.25 square feet (685 × 65% = 445.25) of fenestration and the secondary façade shall contain 97.5 square feet (150 × 65% = 97.5) of fenestration. No other facades contain a public entrance therefore fenestration is not required. 
d.  Fenestration shall not utilize painted glass, reflective glass or other similarly treated or opaque windows. Entrances, windows, and product display windows, are counted towards fenestration requirements. Shuttered windows may be considered based on the elements of the overall design of the building. 
5.  The master developer shall develop additional design guidelines, restrictions and covenants that shall apply to all uses within the Covington Town Center Overlay District. Upon development, such guidelines, restrictions and covenants shall be publicly recorded in the office of the clerk of Superior Court of Newton County, Georgia.

C.  Relocation of Minimum Open Space Requirements. At the option of the property owner, up to fifty (50) percent of a development's required open space may be relocated to an off-site parcel within the city provided the following criteria are met: 
1.  The receiving parcel is in accordance with the comprehensive plan as being a designated recipient parcel; and 
2.  The receiving parcel contains the required amount of open space and said open space in the receiving parcel is located adjacent to and visible from a public street and accessible to the public during normal city park hours. 
(Ord. dated 6/30/08 (part)) 
16.40.020 - Buffer required. 
A.  Buffers shall be as provided in the Buffer Specification Table below. Screening required within buffers shall be set forth in the said schedule of required buffers and is intended to provide separation of spaces without necessarily eliminating visual contact between the spaces, and may consist of existing vegetation, planted vegetation, a landscaped earth berm, a decorative wall, a wood fence, or a combination of the above. 

 
B.  Location of Buffers. Required buffers shall be located along the interior or street lot lines nearest the adjacent streets, land uses, or zoning designations except where such lot lines are intersected by crossing accessways or utility easements, or by a joint parking area. Buffers shall not be located on any portion of an existing or proposed street right-of-way or easement. 
C.  Use of Buffer. Provided the required buffer width and screening is maintained, a buffer may contain utilities, pedestrian and bicycle paths, and other minor or passive uses compatible with the general separation of land uses. Buffers shall not be used for temporary or permanent parking or loading. 
D.  Responsibility for Buffer. Where vacant lots located in different zoning districts are adjacent, the first such lot to be developed shall provide the buffer required next to the adjacent vacant land. At the time it is developed, the second such lot shall provide all additional screening and/or land necessary to provide the total buffer required between the developed land uses. 
E.  Where a buffer meeting the requirements of this section is provided on an adjacent lot, the screening and/or land within that buffer may be counted as contributing to the total buffer required between the adjacent existing land use and the proposed land use. 
F.  Other Required Screening. In addition to the buffer screening required above, a fence may be installed to substitute for planting in conformity with regulations which shall be promulgated by the planning and zoning director when land area is limited. Such screening devices may include solid decorative brick walls, wood fences, berms, or tight evergreen hedges which shall reach the necessary height appropriate to its screening function within two years of planting, or a combination of the said devices. Regulations governing such substitutions shall be maintained permanently as a public record in the planning and zoning office of the city, and copies of same shall be made available to the public without charge at said address during office hours. 
G.  Dumpster Screening. 
1.  All dumpsters shall be enclosed with a wall of equal or greater height on three sides by a masonry wall enclosure that is a minimum of eight feet in height, accessed by an opaque steel gate the material of which shall be similar to the material on the outside of the main building. 
2.  Dumpsters shall be placed in the rear yard and may be located five feet from the property line if the adjoining property is zoned NM, CM, TCM, M1 or M2 and five feet from all applicable buffers if the adjoining property is zoned NR1, NR2, NR3, CR or TCR.

a.  Dumpsters shall be placed on concrete pads of sufficient size and strength to support the weight of service vehicles. 
b.  Restaurants and other food service establishments shall place dumpsters on concrete pads that are designed to slope into a drain that is equipped with a grease trap. 
H.  Mechanical Systems Screening. Accessory mechanical systems and features including air and heating systems shall not be visible from the public right-of-way. 
I.  Alternative Buffers and Screening. In lieu of compliance with the buffers and screening requirements, the planning commission may approve an alternative buffers and screening plan upon the submission of a detailed plan and specifications for landscaping and screening which will afford a degree of buffering and screening equivalent to or exceeding that provided by the foregoing requirements. 
J.  Existing Vegetation. Existing vegetation shall be retained and maintained whenever possible so as to permit such vegetation to contribute to buffer and screening requirements. 
K.  Maintenance of Landscaping. All landscaping and screening providing required buffering and screening shall be maintained so as to continue their effectiveness. 
L.  Uses Requiring Fences in Commercial and Industrial Areas. In any district where reference is made requiring adequate screening of a specified operation, such screening shall be a wall or fence of solid appearance or tight evergreen hedge not less than six feet in height for such uses as junkyards, lumberyards, sanitary landfills, manufacturing plants where outside storage is used, commercial kennels and auto service garages where auto storage is provided outside of buildings. 
M.  Administration, Inspection, and Enforcement. 
1.  All of the provisions of this section shall be administered and enforced by the planning and zoning director, whose duties shall include developing and maintaining specific regulations to give effect to the intent of this section, rendering interpretations as to the requirements of this section, inspecting buffers and enforcement of all provisions of this section.

Chapter 16.48 - SIGNS 

16.48.010 - Purpose and intent. 
It is the purpose of the city council in enacting this chapter to provide standards to safeguard life, public health, property and welfare by regulating the location, size, illumination, erection, maintenance and quality of materials of all signs. More specifically, signs have a powerful impact on the aesthetic environment of the community, and it is the further purpose of this chapter to encourage an aesthetically attractive environment, while allowing sufficient opportunities for communications to serve business and comply with the federal and state constitutions and laws. Signs create visual clutter and therefore should be regulated in their size, location, construction and illumination. Signs can detract from the beauty of a neighborhood and lower property values. In seeking to comply with federal and Georgia law, the city council has determined the following: large billboards are, as the U.S. Supreme Court has recognized, an aesthetic harm; the Georgia Supreme Court has upheld sign regulations on the basis of aesthetics and preserving the beauty of environment; and, judicial decisions of the Eleventh Circuit have recognized that portable signs are visual clutter and a potential traffic hazard. These holdings support the constitutionality of this chapter, as intended by the city. 
Many signs can also be a hazard and negatively impact traffic safety by distracting drivers and blocking views of other vehicles and dangers, by making intersections more treacherous, and by making it difficult to see oncoming traffic when entering a roadway. Therefore, it is also the purpose of this chapter to prevent those harms by regulating signs to safe locations, safe sizes, with proper and safe illumination and construction.

(Ord. dated 6/30/08 (part)) 
16.56.040 - General provisions. 
A.  Principal or Accessory Use. A support structure and/or antenna is considered a principal use if located on any lot or parcel of land as the sole or primary structure, and is considered an accessory use if located on a lot or parcel shared with a different existing primary use or existing structures. An existing use or structure on the same lot or parcel shall not preclude the installation of an antenna or support structure. For purposes of determining whether the installation of a support structure or antenna complies with zoning district requirements, including but not limited to setback, buffer and other requirements, the dimensions of the entire lot or parcel shall control, even though the antenna or support structure may be located on a leased area within such lot or parcel. Support structures that are constructed, and antennas that are installed, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter shall not be deemed to constitute the expansion of a nonconforming use or structure. 
B.  Five-Year Plan and Inventory of Existing Sites. To facilitate the co-location of antennas and future land use planning, each applicant seeking to locate a new support structure, alternative support structure or antenna, or modify any such existing structure, shall provide to the planning and zoning director an inventory of its existing support structures or alternative support structures, existing support structures or alternative structures to be upgraded or replaced, and proposed support structures or alternative structures to be constructed in the next five years following the date of the application. The planning and zoning director shall provide the city of Covington board of tax assessors with a copy of the inventory. 
2.  The inventory shall include all such structures owned or leased by the applicant that are within the jurisdiction of the governing authority; within Newton County; and, within a neighboring county which currently is capable of providing coverage or capacity within the city of Covington, and shall include specific information about the location (latitude and longitude coordinates), height, design, support structure type and general suitability for antenna co-location of each support structure or alternative structure, and other pertinent information as may be required by the planning and zoning director. 
3.  If the applicant does not know specific future support structure and antenna site locations but does know of areas where telecommunications facilities will be needed within the next five years to provide service, the applicant shall list the assessor's blocks contained within the geographic service area and identify each geographic service area with a number that will correspond to the future telecommunication facility site. 
4.  The planning and zoning director may share the location of existing telecommunication facility sites with other applicants seeking to locate support structures or antennas within the jurisdiction of the governing authority; provided, however that the department is not, by sharing such information, in any way representing or warranting that such sites are available or suitable. The location of any proposed telecommunication facility sites will be protected as privileged information if the applicant so requests and it is considered as such under the applicable laws and legal authority. 
C.  Co-location—Design Requirements. In addition to all applicable building and safety codes, all support structures shall be designed to accommodate the co-location of cellular telecommunication antennas according to the following: 
1.  For support structures up to ninety (90) feet in height, the structure and fenced compound shall be designed to accommodate the maximum number of users as determined by the most current technology; 
2.  For support structures ninety (90) feet to one hundred fifty (150) feet in height, the structure and fenced compound shall be designed to accommodate at least three providers or the maximum number of users as determined by the most current technology, whichever is greater; 
3.  For support structures one hundred fifty (150) feet to two hundred (200) feet in height, the structure and fenced compound shall be designed to accommodate at least four providers or the maximum number of users as determined by the most current technology, whichever is greater; 
4.  No support structure shall exceed two hundred (200) feet in height. 
D.  Co-location—Availability of Suitable Existing Structures. No new support structure shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the planning and zoning director and governing authority that no existing support structure or existing alternative support structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna. The applicant shall submit an inventory of all support structures or alternative support structures located within one-half mile of the proposed location. All evidence submitted shall be signed and sealed by appropriate licensed professionals or qualified industry experts. All required evidence must be submitted with the application. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing support structure or other structure can accommodate the proposed antenna shall consist of one or more of the following: 
1.  No existing support structures or suitable alternative support structures are located within the geographic antenna placement area required to meet the applicant's engineering requirements; 
2.  Existing support structures or structures are not of sufficient height to meet the applicant's engineering requirements; 
3.  Existing support structures or structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support the applicant's antenna and related equipment; 
4.  The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna(s) on the existing support structures or structures, or the antenna on the existing support structures or structures would cause interference with the applicant's proposed antenna; 
5.  The cost or contractual provisions required by the support structure owner to share an existing support structure or alternative support structure or to adapt an existing support structure or alternative support structure for sharing exceed the cost of new support structure development. Specific cost information must be submitted if this justification is to be relied upon; and 
6.  The applicant adequately demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render existing support structures and structures unsuitable, other than economic reasons. If the requirement of co-location will cause additional expense to the applicant, all such costs must be specifically shown. 
E.  Aesthetics. The guidelines set forth in this subsection shall govern the design and construction of all support structures, and the installation of all antennas governed by this chapter. 
1.  Support structures and/or antennas shall either maintain a galvanized steel or concrete finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, be painted a neutral color so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness. 
2.  At all support structure sites, the design of all buildings and related structures shall use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the support structure facilities to the natural setting and building environment. Any equipment or cabinet that supports telecommunication facilities must be concealed from public view and made compatible with the architecture of the surrounding structures or placed underground. Equipment shelters or cabinets shall be screened from public view by using landscaping or materials and colors consistent with the surrounding backdrop. The shelter or cabinet must be regularly maintained. 
3.  For antennas installed on a structure other than a support structure, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical ground equipment shall be of a neutral color so as to make the antenna and related equipment visually unobtrusive. 
4.  Support structures shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the FAA or other applicable authority. If the lighting is required, the governing authority may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views. 
5.  No signage or other identifying markings or signs shall be permitted upon any support structure or alternative support structure within the city of Covington. 
6.  To the extent practical, telecommunication facilities shall not be placed in a direct line of sight with historic or scenic view corridors as designated by the governing body or by any state or federal law or agency. 
7.  Access to the support structure site shall be restricted so as to minimize visibility of the access. Where possible, existing roads shall be used. Where no roads exist, access shall follow the existing contours of the land. 
8.  Such other additional requirements as the planning and zoning director shall reasonably require to minimize the visual impact of the site on the surrounding area. 
F.  Setbacks and Separation. The following setbacks and separation requirements shall apply to all support structures. 
1.  Support structures shall be setback a distance equal to the height of the support structure from its base to any public right-of-way or occupied structure, or property line of the lot or parcel containing the support structure. 
2.  Guy-wires and accessory buildings and facilities shall meet the minimum accessory use location and setback requirements. 
3.  In zoning districts other than M1 and M2, support structures shall not be located closer than two thousand (2,000) feet from any existing support structure. 
4.  In the event an applicant clearly demonstrates that, given the structural failure characteristics of an alternative structure design, the required setbacks are excessive and unduly burdensome, the applicant may request the setbacks be reduced. In determining whether setbacks shall be reduced, consideration shall be given to both the danger from structure collapse and falling debris, such as ice, from a structure. 
G.  Security Fencing/Anti-climbing Devices. All support structures and supporting equipment shall be enclosed by fencing not less than six feet in height and shall also be equipped with appropriate anti-climbing devices. Fencing shall be of chain link, wood or other approved alternative. 
H.  Landscaping. The following requirements shall govern landscaping surrounding all support structures. 
1.  Where adequate vegetation is not present, support structure facilities shall be landscaped with a landscaped strip of plant materials which effectively screens the view of the support structure compound. Landscaped strips shall be a minimum of ten (10) feet in width and located outside the fenced perimeter of the compound. 
2.  Existing mature tree growth and natural landforms on the site shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. Where natural vegetation around the perimeter of the site would provide an adequate visual screen, an undisturbed buffer may be utilized. The applicant shall provide a site plan showing existing significant vegetation to be removed, and vegetation to be replanted to replace that lost. 
3.  Landscaping shall be maintained by the provider and shall be subject to periodic review by the planning and zoning director to assure proper maintenance. Failure to maintain landscaping shall be deemed a violation of this chapter. 
I.  Maintenance Impacts. Equipment at a transmission facility shall be automated to the greatest extent possible to reduce traffic and congestion. Where the site abuts or has access to a collector or local street, access for maintenance vehicles shall be exclusively by means of the collector or local street, utilizing existing access to the property on which such facility is to be located, where possible. 
J.  Review of Support Structure and Antenna Erection by the Airport Authority. If, upon receipt of an application for the erection of any support structure or alternative support structure governed by this chapter, the department deems that the proposed structure may interfere with or affect the operation of existing or proposed airport facilities, a copy of the application shall be submitted by the planning and zoning director to the airport authority for review and recommendation. 
K.  Federal Requirements. All support structures must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the federal government with the authority to regulate support structures and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed, the permittee or the lessee of the support structure and antenna governed by this chapter shall bring such support structure and/or antenna into compliance with such revised standards or regulations within six months of the effective date of such standards and regulations unless a more or less stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal agency. Failure to bring such support structure and/or antenna into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall be deemed to be a declaration of abandonment of the support structure and constitute grounds for the removal of the support structure or antenna at the owner's, permittee's, or lessee's expense. 
L.  Building Codes—Safety Standards. To ensure the structural integrity of support structures, the owner, permittee or subsequent lessee of a support structure or alternative support structure shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes and the applicable standards for support structures that are published by the Electronic Industries Association, as amended from time to time. If, upon inspection, the department concludes that a support structure fails to comply with all applicable codes and standards, or constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon receipt of written notice by the owner, permittee or lessee of the support structure, said party shall have fifteen (15) days to bring the support structure into compliance with such standards. Failure to bring such support structure into compliance within fifteen (15) days shall be deemed a declaration of abandonment of the support structure and constitute grounds for removal of the support structure. Prior to the removal of any support structure, the department may consider detailed plans submitted by the owner, permittee or subsequent lessee for repair of substandard support structures, and may grant a reasonable extension of the above referenced compliance period. 
M.  Change of Ownership Notification. Upon the transfer of ownership of an interest in any support structure, alternative support structure, or lot upon which such a structure has been erected, the support structure permittee shall notify the planning and zoning director of the transaction in writing within thirty (30) days.
