         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE                       This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Alma, Georgia. 
                      Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1981 Code, as updated by ordinances subsequently adopted by the City Council through December 19, 2011. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1981 Code, as updated through December 19, 2011. 
                      The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
                  Chapter and Section Numbering System 
                      The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
                  Page Numbering System 
                      The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

                  Indexes 
                      The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
                  Looseleaf Supplements 
                      A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
                      Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
                  Acknowledgments 
                      This publication was under the direct supervision of Jim Jenkins, Senior Code Attorney, and D. J. Heath, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
                      The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Nicholas Overstreet, City Manager, for his cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that his efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the City readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

In such cases, the defendant in execution shall have the right to file an affidavit of illegality if such execution shall have issued illegally or if it is proceeding illegally in either of which cases such execution shall be returned by the levying officer to the Superior Court of Bacon County for trial as in other cases of affidavit of illegality; provided bond shall be made as in other cases of illegality.

                  Sec. 1-2. - Rules of construction; definitions. 
                      In the construction of this Code of Ordinances, the following rules shall be observed, unless such construction would be inconsistent with the manifest intent of the city council: 
                      Generally. 
                  (1)	All general provisions, terms, phrases and expressions contained in this Code shall be liberally construed in order that the true intent and meaning of the county council may be fully carried out. Terms used in this Code, unless otherwise specifically provided, shall have the meanings prescribed by the state statutes for the same terms. 
                  (2)	In the interpretation and application of any provisions of this Code, they shall be held to be the minimum requirements adopted for the promotion of the public health, safety, comfort, convenience and general welfare. Where any provision of this Code imposes greater restrictions upon the subject matter than other more general provisions imposed by the Code, the provision imposing the greater restriction or regulation shall be deemed to be controlling. 
                  (3)	In the construction of this Code and of all ordinances of the county, all things and places therein referred to shall, unless a contrary intention appears, be construed to mean things and places situated in the county or employed by or appertaining to the county. 
                      City. The term "the city" or "this city" shall be construed as if the term "of Alma" followed it. 
                      Code. The term "Code" means The Code of Ordinances, City of Alma, Georgia, as designated in section 1-1. 
                      Computation of time. Whenever a notice is required to be given or an act to be done, a certain length of time before any proceeding shall be had, the day on which such notice is given, or such act is done, shall be counted in computing the time, but the day on which such proceeding is to be had shall not be counted. 
                      Council, mayor and council, governing body. Whenever the terms "council," "mayor and council," "city council" or "governing body" are used they shall be construed to mean the city council of the City of Alma. 
                      County. The term "the county" or "this county" means Bacon County in the State of Georgia. 
                      Delegation of authority. Whenever a provision appears requiring the head of a department of the city to do some act or make certain inspections it is to be construed to authorize the head of the department to designate, delegate and authorize subordinates to perform the required act or make the required inspection unless the terms of the provision or section designate otherwise. 
                      Gender. A word importing the one gender only shall extend to and be applied to the other gender and to legal entities in addition to persons, as the context will admit. 
                      Joint authority. All words giving a joint authority to three or more persons or officers shall be construed as giving such authority to a majority of such persons or officers. 
                      Keeper and proprietor. The terms "keeper" and "proprietor" mean and include persons, firms, associations, corporations, clubs and partnerships, whether acting by themselves or a servant, agent or employee. 
                      Month. The term "month" means a calendar month. 
                      Number. A word importing the singular number only may extend to and be applied to several persons and things as well as to one person and thing. 
                      Oath. The term "oath" shall be construed to include an affirmation in all cases in which, by law, an affirmation may be substituted for an oath, and in such cases the terms "swear" and "sworn" shall be equivalent to the terms "affirm" and "affirmed." 
                      O.C.G.A. The abbreviation "O.C.G.A" means the latest edition of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, as amended. 
                      Or, and. The term "or" may be read "and," and the term "and" may be read "or," if the sense requires it. 
                      Overlapping provisions. Where any provision of this Code imposes greater restrictions upon the subject matter than any general provisions imposed by this Code, the provision imposing the greater restriction or regulation shall be applicable. 
                      Owner. The term "owner," applied to a building or land, includes any part owner, joint owner, tenant in common, tenant in partnership, joint tenant, or tenant by the entirety of the whole or of a part of such building or land. 
                      Person. The term "person" includes individual natural persons, partnerships, joint ventures, societies, associations, clubs, trustees, trusts, or corporations; and any officers, agents, employees, factors, or any kind of personal representatives of any thereof, in any capacity, acting either for such person, or for any other person, under either personal appointment or pursuant to law.

                      State. The term "the state" or "this state" shall be construed to mean the State of Georgia. 
                      Street. The term "street" shall be construed to embrace streets, avenues, boulevards, roads, alleys, lanes, viaducts and all other public highways in the city, to the boundaries of the rights-of-way.

                      Tenant or occupant. The term "tenant" or "occupant," applied to a building or land, includes any person holding a written or oral lease of or who occupies the whole or a part of such buildings or land, either alone or with others.

                      The catchlines of sections of this Code printed in boldface type, italics or otherwise, are intended as mere catchwords to indicate the contents of the section, and shall not be deemed or taken to be titles of such sections, nor as any part of the section, nor, unless expressly so provided, shall they be so deemed when any of such sections, including the catchlines, are amended or reenacted.

                  (Code 1969, § 1-5; Code 1981, § 1-5)
                  State Law reference— Severability, O.C.G.A. § 1-1-3.

                  (a)	All ordinances passed subsequent to this Code of Ordinances which amend, repeal or in any way affect this Code of Ordinances, may be numbered in accordance with the numbering system of this Code and printed for inclusion therein.

                  (b)	Amendments to any of the provisions of this Code shall be made by amending such provisions by specific reference to the section of this Code in substantially the following language: "That section ____________ of the Code of Ordinances, City of Alma, Georgia, is hereby amended to read as follows:  (Set out new provisions in full) ." 
                  (c)	When the city council desires to enact an ordinance of a general and permanent nature on a subject not heretofore existing in the Code, which the city council desires to incorporate into the Code, a section in substantially the following language shall be made a part of the ordinance: "Section ____________. It is the intention of the city council, and it is hereby ordained that the provisions of this ordinance shall become and be made a part of the Code of Ordinances, City of Alma, Georgia, and the sections of this ordinance may be renumbered to accomplish such intention." 
                  (d)	All sections, articles, chapters or provisions of this Code desired to be repealed should be specifically repealed by section or chapter number, as the case may be. 
                  (Code 1981, § 1-6)
                  Sec. 1-7. - Supplementation of Code. 
                  (a)	By contract or by city personnel, supplements to this Code shall be prepared and printed whenever authorized or directed by the city council. A supplement to the Code shall include all substantive permanent and general parts of ordinances passed by the city council or adopted by initiative and referendum during the period covered by the supplement and all changes made thereby in the Code. The pages of a supplement shall be so numbered that they will fit properly into the Code and will, where necessary, replace pages which have become obsolete or partially obsolete, and the new pages shall be so prepared that, when they have been inserted, the Code will be current through the date of the adoption of the latest ordinance included in the supplement. 
                  (b)	In preparing a supplement to this Code, all portions of the Code which have been repealed shall be excluded from the Code by the omission thereof from reprinted pages. 
                  (c)	When preparing a supplement to this Code, the codifier (meaning the person, agency or organization authorized to prepare the supplement) may make formal, nonsubstantive changes in ordinances and parts of ordinances included in the supplement, insofar as it is necessary to do so to embody them into a unified code. For example, the codifier may: 
                  (1)	Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions;
                  (2)	Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles; 
                  (3)	Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the Code and, where necessary to accommodate new material, change existing section or other subdivision numbers; 
                  (4)	Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case may be, or to "sections ____________ to ____________" (inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code); and 
                  (5)	Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meaning of ordinance sections inserted into the Code; but, in no case, shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code. 
                  (Code 1981, § 1-7)
                  Sec. 1-8. - General penalty. 
                  (a)	Unless a higher penalty is otherwise specified, whenever in this Code or in any ordinance of the city any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an offense, or whenever in this Code or any ordinance the doing of any act is required and the failure to do such act is declared to be unlawful, and no specific penalty is provided, and unless otherwise provided by state law, the violation of any such provision of this Code or any such ordinance shall be punished by a fine not to exceed $1,000.00 and imprisonment in the city or county jail and work and labor on the streets or public works of the city, whether within or without the corporate limits, not to exceed one year, or both a fine and sentence of imprisonment and labor; and all sentences may be in the alternative and fines may be imposed with the alternative of sentence to imprisonment and labor if the fines are not paid. Each day any violation of this Code or of any ordinance shall continue shall constitute a separate offense. 
                  (b)	Violations of this Code may be abated by injunctive or other equitable relief. The imposition of a penalty does not prevent injunctive relief. 
                  (c)	The judge of the municipal court shall have the power and authority to:
                  (1)	Impose upon persons convicted in the municipal court the fines provided for in this Code, the ordinances of the city, or as otherwise provided by law, with the alternative of other punishment allowed by law, if such fines are not paid; 
                  (2)	Sentence such person to community service work; or
                  (3)	Impose a sentence consisting of any combination of the penalties provided for in this section. 
                  (d)	The judge of the municipal court shall have full power and authority to declare the forfeiture of bonds given by offenders for their appearance before the municipal court upon the offender's failure to appear as provided for in such bond. The procedure for the forfeiture of such bonds shall be as is provided for the forfeiture of bonds and recognizance set forth in O.C.G.A. § 17-6-70 et seq.

Any person violating this section shall be punished as provided in section 1-8. 
                  (Code 1981, § 1-9)
                  Sec. 1-10. - Interpretation of Code. 
                      In all interpretations of this Code, and ordinances, the courts shall look diligently for the intention of the city council, keeping in view, at all times, the old law, the evil, and the remedy. Grammatical errors shall not vitiate, and a transposition of words and clauses may be resorted to when the sentence or clause is without meaning as it stands. 
                  State Law reference— Similar provisions as to state laws, O.C.G.A. § 1-3-1. 
                  Sec. 1-11. - Substantive compliance with Code.

                  3.

                  (c)	Effective date. This section shall become effective only upon the signing of a declaration of emergency, stating this section is in effect.

                  (a)	The council may amend the operating budget proposed by the city manager except, that the budget as finally amended and adopted must provide for all expenditures required by law or by other provisions of the Charter and for all debt service requirements for the ensuing fiscal year and the total appropriations from any fund shall not exceed the estimated fund balance, reserves and revenues, constituting the fund availability of such fund. 
                  (b)	The council shall adopt the final operating budget for the ensuing fiscal year not later than one day prior to the beginning of each fiscal year. If the council fails to adopt the budget by said date, the amounts appropriated for operation for the current fiscal year shall be deemed adopted for the ensuing year on a month-to-month basis, with all items prorated accordingly until such time as the council adopts a budget for the ensuing fiscal year. Such adoption shall take the form of an appropriation ordinance setting out the estimated revenues in detail by sources and making appropriations according to fund and by operating department, organizational unit, purpose or activity as set out in the budget document. 
                  (c)	The amount set out in the adopted operating budget for each operating department or organizational unit shall constitute the annual appropriation for such item, and no expenditure shall be made or encumbrance created in excess of the otherwise unencumbered balance of the appropriations, or allotment thereof, to which it is chargeable.

                      As the next order of business following adoption of the operating budget, the council shall levy by ordinance an annual tax on all real and personal property within the city. The tax rate set by such ordinance shall be such that reasonable estimates of revenues from such levy shall at least be sufficient, together with other anticipated revenues, fund balances and applicable reserves, to equal the total amount appropriated for each of the several funds set forth in the annual operating budget for defraying the expenses of the general government of the city.

                      The council may make appropriations in addition to those contained in the current budget, at any regular or special meeting called for such purpose, but any such additional appropriations may be made only from an existing unappropriated surplus in the fund to which it applies.

The council shall have power to accept with or without amendments, or reject the proposed program and proposed means of financing. The council shall not authorize an expenditure for the construction of any building or structure, or for work or improvement, unless the appropriations for such project are included in the capital improvements budget, except to meet a public emergency threatening the lives, health or property of the inhabitants, when passed by four votes of the council. 
                  (b)	The council shall adopt the final capital improvements budget for the ensuing fiscal year not later than one day prior to the beginning of each fiscal year. No appropriation provided for in the capital improvements budget shall elapse until the purpose for which the appropriation was made shall have been accomplished or abandoned; provided the mayor or the city manager may submit amendments to the capital improvements budget at any time during the fiscal year, accompanied by recommendations thereon. Any such amendments to the capital improvements budget shall become effective only upon adoption by a vote of the council.

                  (b)	The council may quitclaim any rights it may have in property not needed for public purposes upon report by the city manager and adoption of a resolution, both finding that the property is not needed for public or other purposes and that the interest of city has no readily ascertainable monetary value. 
                  (c)	Whenever in opening, extending or widening any street, avenue, alley or public place of the city, a small parcel or tract of land is cut off or separated by such work from a larger tract or boundary of land owned by the city, the council may authorize the city manager to execute and deliver in the name of the city a deed conveying said cutoff or separated parcel or tract of land to abutting or adjoining property owners in exchange for rights-of-way of said street, avenue, alley or public place or in settlement of any alleged damages sustained by said abutting or adjoining property owners. All deeds and conveyances heretofore and hereafter so executed and delivered shall convey all title and interest the city has in such property, notwithstanding the fact that no public sale after advertisement was or is thereafter made.

                  (a)	The city may utilize state contracts in lieu of issuing bids or buying locally when it is to the economic advantage of the city. 
                  (b)	When determined by the city council that there would be a financial or operational benefit to the city as a result of less down time, faster delivery, improved routine or warranty maintenance schedule, better agent response or another best management practice that would be deemed advantageous to the city, the city council may enact a local vendor preference provision subject to the below criteria: 
                  (1)	A local vendor is defined as a qualified provider of services and/or materials having had a city business license for at least one year prior to the bid award date and issued a current business license with a city or county business address. 
                  (2)	The local vendor preference shall be to match the qualified, low nonlocal vendor's bid if the local vendor is: 
                  a.	Within seven percent of $40,000.00 of the low bid.
                  b.	Within five percent of $75,000.00 of the low bid.
                  c.	Within three percent of $100,000.00 of the low bid.
                  (3)	The local vendor must confirm in writing within five working days of the city council's enactment of matching or exceeding the low bid price. Failure to do so will void the local bidder preference provision. 
                  (4)	If two or more local bidders qualify for the preference, the lowest written submitted response within five working days will receive the award. 
                  (5)	This preference shall not apply to public works bids as defined by the state.
                  (c)	If a bidder is determined to not meet the bid specifications it shall be immediately advised in writing of the basis for the determination by the city or the project engineer and/or administrator. Should the bidder desire to appeal this determination, it must respond in writing within seven working days of the date of the notice. This written response will be included in the bid package forwarded to the city council for review. The city council shall then decide if it wishes to consider the appeal. The city council action is final.

                  (1)	The term "substantial improvement" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the start of construction of the improvement. The term "substantial improvement" includes structures, which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. Note: The market value of the structure should be the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement; or in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. For the purposes of this definition, substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  (2)	The term "substantial improvement" does not include:
                  a.	Those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to ensure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project; or 
                  b.	Any alteration of a historic structure provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
                      Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions means where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                      Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. 
                      Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  Sec. 42-4. - Findings of fact. 
                  (a)	The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (b)	These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
                  (Ord. of 8-2-2010, art. 1, § B)
                  Sec. 42-5. - Statement of purpose. 
                      It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)	Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, are protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)	Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities or erosion; 
                  (3)	Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
                  (4)	Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and 
                  (5)	Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.

                  Sec. 42-6. - Objectives. 
                      The objectives of this chapter are: 
                  (1)	To protect human life and health;
                  (2)	To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
                  (3)	To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; 
                  (4)	To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
                  (5)	To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
                  (6)	To minimize prolonged business interruptions; and
                  (7)	To ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

                  ARTICLE III. - PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

                  Sec. 42-68. - General standards. 
                      In all areas of special flood hazard, the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)	New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure; 
                  (2)	New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage; 
                  (3)	New construction or substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
                  (4)	Elevated buildings. All new construction or substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater as follows: 
                  a.	Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
                  1.	Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
                  2.	The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and
                  3.	Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both direction; 
                  b.	So as not to violate the lowest floor criteria of this chapter, the unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area; and 
                  c.	The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms; 
                  (5)	All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding; 
                  (6)	Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces; 
                  (7)	New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system; 
                  (8)	New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters; 
                  (9)	On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding; and 
                  (10)	Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure, which is not in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, shall be undertaken only if the nonconformity is not furthered, extended or replaced.

                  Sec. 42-69. - Specific standards. 
                      In all areas of special flood hazard, the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)	New construction and/or substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and/or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 42-68(4), elevated buildings. All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at, or above, one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  (2)	Nonresidential construction. New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH zones, may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions in this subsection, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth in this subsection and in section 42-47(a)(7). 
                  (3)	Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
                  a.	All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on:
                  1.	Individual lots or parcels;
                  2.	In new and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions;
                  3.	In expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions; or
                  4.	On a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  b.	Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
                  1.	The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or 
                  2.	The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
                  c.	All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (Refer to section 42-68(6).) 
                  d.	All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either:
                  1.	Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days;
                  2.	Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions); or 
                  3.	The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for new construction, including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsection (3)d.3 of this section. 
                  (4)	Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 42-8 are areas designated as floodways. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  a.	Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted; provided, however, it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
                  b.	Only if subsection (4)a of this section is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this article.

                  Sec. 42-70. - Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodway (A zones). 
                  (a)	Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 42-8, where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A zones), or where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, then the code enforcement officer shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state or other source, in order to administer the provisions of this article. Only if data are not available from these sources, then the following provisions shall apply: 
                  (1)	No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 20 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in more than a one-foot increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
                  (2)	In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. (Note: Require the lowest floor to be elevated one foot above the estimated base flood elevation in A zone areas where a limited detail study has been completed.) Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 42-68(4), elevated buildings. All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. 
                  (b)	The code enforcement officer shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file.

                  a.	A finding of good and sufficient cause;
                  b.	A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  c.	A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  (2)	The provisions of this chapter are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (3)	Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (4)	The code enforcement officer shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (i)	Upon consideration of the factors listed in this section and the purposes of this chapter, the board of appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

                  Sec. 70-101. - Services. 
                      The city is dedicated to providing our customers with professional service at a reasonable cost. All accounts are important and the city wishes to serve the public in a courteous, friendly and helpful manner. The following services are available without regard to race, color, sex, age, disability, religion or national origin: 
                  (1)	Deposits. All new accounts (renters and owners) will be required to pay a deposit as follows when opening a new account: 
                  a.	Residential service .....$  75.00 
                  b.	Commercial service ..... 125.00 
                  Deposits will be refunded upon the customer's notification to the city that services are no longer needed and a reading of the meter has been taken. Any unpaid balance will be deducted from the customer's deposit. If the amount due is more than the deposit the customer will be responsible for the remaining balance. It is the customer's responsibility to notify the city of the date that service is no longer required. The customer is ultimately responsible for any unpaid balance. 
                  (2)	Meter readings. Water meters are read each month. Readings are divided into two books. The readings are done with the use of radio reads and some by hand. In the event of an unusual circumstance where a meter is unable to be read by any means, an average will be done as a last measure. 
                  (3)	Late charges; cut offs. All payments are due and receivable by the city on or before the tenth day of each month. Weekends and city holidays are considered with penalties if a payment is made the next business date. A five percent late charge is added to the account when full payment is not received within the stated period of time. If the city does not receive full payment within 30 days from the due date, the account is placed in the cutoff status and water service is disconnected until payment is received. Once a meter has been cut off, full payment must be received and a reconnection fee of $20.00 is required to have the water services reinstated. Partial payments will be accepted but services will not be reinstated until full payment, plus any late charges and fees, are paid. Every customer's account must be paid by 4:00 p.m. on the date services are disconnected in order for services to be restored the same day. If payment is not received once the water is cut off, during the next billing cycle of the account, the account is placed in a final status and the deposit is used toward the bill. The customer is then required to pay a new deposit upon reconnection of services. Any bill that remains with an outstanding balance due and that is over 90 days past due will receive a letter notifying them that the account is subject to collections. Ten days after notification and if the account remains unpaid and all efforts to collect the account have been exhausted, the city is authorized to pursue the account in whatever action it deems appropriate, including but not limited to magistrate court and/or placement of liens on the subject's property. 
                  1 month
                  10th penalty is placed on the customer's bill
                  2 month
                  10th cutoff of customer's services
                  3 month
                  10th finalized customer's bill/new deposit required, if
                  services are desired again
                   
                  (4)	Fines. If water services have been cut off due to nonpayment and the city's meter is cut on illegally by anyone other than an authorized agent of the city, a fee of $50.00 will be applied to the customer's account by the water department and a citation written by the city police department for theft by taking is filed and the customer may appear in court where additional fines may be deemed payable also. 
                  (5)	Water meter ownership. All water meters are the property of the city. Installation fees are for the cost incurred by the city for providing the connection and not the purchase of a meter by the customer. Water meter valves are not designed for or are they to be used for cutting off water flow to a home or business by anyone other than a city representative. A separate cut off valve should be installed by a licensed plumber at the owner's expense for the cutting of water on and off by the property owner. The property owner is responsible for all leaks and repairs from the connection at the meter on the property owner's side of the meter. 
                  (6)	Installation of meters. Meters are installed only by the city. A request must be made by the property owner and an installation fee according to size of pipe requested and the corresponding published fees are paid in full. The director of public works will determine the feasibility of connections for all new requests according to location and economical cost. The city will install the meter in a timely manner after all requirements are met and payment received, provided however, reasonable conditions exist which would not prevent, interfere, or prolong installation of the meter. 
                  (7)	Billing/rates. The immediate prior month's accounts are entered in the computer as each book of customers has been read and finalized. Billing statements are mailed at intervals corresponding with each book's monthly closure. Computerized statements are then printed for mailing. The statement includes the previous month's reading, current reading, total gallons consumed, amount of charges for water, sewer and garbage, due date and late fee, should it be incurred.

                  Customers are responsible for payment of water/sewer/garbage/trash billing combined as one bill monthly. 
                  (8)	Rate adjustments. A rate adjustment may be granted by the public works director or city manager for a customer who has had a sudden accidental leak and has had the leak repaired by a licensed plumber. An adjustment is eligible twice per year per customer. (See adjustment policy for eligibility). Any more than two per calendar year must be approved by the public works director and the city manager. 
                  (9)	Write down/write offs. Please refer to article V of this chapter, pertaining to the city's write down/write off policy. 
                  (10)	Request for services outside the city. All requests for water and/or sewer services must be made to the public works director in writing and containing details as to the applicant's name and address, exact location of the property, distance from applicant's property line to nearest service connection, size of line, type of customer, commercial, industrial, residential, etc., and other information deemed necessary by the city. The public works director or his/her designee shall make a determination as to the feasibility of the service extension outside the incorporated area and make such recommendation to the city manager and mayor. Should the recommendation be made to make the extension, the city shall follow the procedures as set forth and outlined in the city/county agreement dated August 1999. 
                  (11)	Sewer stoppages. The property owner is responsible for any stoppage in the sewer pipe from the facility to the tie-in of the city's main line. Before the city responds to a customer's call for assistance, the customer must have called a licensed plumber to check for stoppages to the point of the main line. If the plumber cannot unstop the line, the plumber, not the resident, must call city hall giving all the details of the problem before the city can respond. Once the city has responded to a call and found the stoppage to be on the customer's line, a fee of $25.00 is charged to the customer. 
                  (12)	Sewer line repair/replacement. The customer is responsible for the repair, maintenance, and replacement of sewer lines from the structure to the main line of the city. If the damaged line goes under a sidewalk or public paved area, the city will have the option, at its expense, to repair or replace the existing sewer line from the connection at the main line to the end of the city-owned right-of-way; or may determine the best and more feasible option to make a separate connection at another alternative location.

                  ARTICLE V. - WATER/SEWER AND SOLID WASTE DEPARTMENT WRITE DOWN/WRITE OFF 

                  Sec. 70-131. - Purpose. 
                      The purpose of this article is to establish fair and opened procedures for write off or write down of bills for water, sewer and waste management services. 
                  (Ord. of 2-2-2009(02))
                  Sec. 70-132. - Narrative. 
                      There are numerous reasons why a water, sewer or waste management bill may need to be written down or written off completely. Some can be caused by the city such as faulty meters, bad meter readings, etc. Sometimes the blame may lie with the customer such as undetected leaks. And even sometimes the blame is unassigned such as the untimely death of a customer with no survivors. A write down or write off may be the result of a customer falling on financial hardship beyond their control. Whatever the facts and circumstances, the city would like to provide procedures that will deal with the situation in a fair and considerate manner for the customer while not violating the public trust. 
                  (Ord. of 2-2-2009(02))
                  Sec. 70-133. - Procedure. 
                      In order to ensure all write offs and write downs are done in an open manner, a log of each write down or write off will be maintained in the billing department. No biller or city personnel can cause a write down or write off without checking the log first to verify it has been recorded and approval has been secured under the following authorization levels. The following limits of approval for a write down or write off will be in force as of the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived: 
                  Managers (city manager and public works director)
                  $1.00 to $500.00
                  Mayor
                  $501.00 to $1,000.00
                  City council
                  $1,001.00 and above
                   
                  The managers' and mayor's authorizations can be evidenced by their signature on the appropriate log line. The city council's authorization will be supported by official minutes of city council meetings and signed off on by the city clerk on the appropriate log line.

                  Sec. 78-131. - Preliminary plat approval. 
                      Construction of improvements shall not commence until the preliminary plat has been approved.

                  Sec. 78-132. - Improvements installed by subdivider. 
                      The subdivider shall be required to install or have installed at his expense the following improvements: 
                  (1)	Monuments. Two concrete monuments at least 36 inches in length and four inches square with a suitable center point at each street intersection on the right-of-way line, and iron pin monuments three-fourths of an inch in diameter and 24 inches long at all points on boundary lines of lots where there is a change in directions and at all lot corners. 
                  (2)	Streets. At least 1½ inches of hot plant mix asphalt on a base of at least six inches thickness of compacted class "A" or "B" sand-clay or topsoil, or equivalent as specified by the Georgia State Highway Department. No final grading or paving of the street, or construction or installation of utilities in the bed of a street shall be permitted until the grade has been officially established. No paving shall begin until the compacted base has been inspected and approved by the official representative of the city, and underground utilities installed and approved. 
                  (3)	Water mains. Where a public water main is within 1,500 feet of the subdivision at its nearest point, the subdivider shall connect with such water main. In such cases, mains of at least six inches shall be required. The subdivider shall be responsible for the costs of all taps and extensions to existing municipal facilities. Where a public water main is not reasonably accessible as determined by the planning commission, the subdivider shall provide an individual water supply according to the standards of the City of Alma or the Bacon County Health Department, and the most restrictive standard shall apply. 
                  (4)	Sanitary sewers. Wherever a public sanitary sewer is within 1,500 feet of the subdivision at its nearest point and connection by gravity flow is feasible, the subdivider shall connect with such sanitary sewer and provide a connection for each lot. The size of the mains shall be at least eight inches. The subdivider shall be responsible for the costs of all taps, lift pump stations, manholes and extensions to existing municipal facilities. Where sanitary sewers are not available, an oxidation pond, septic tank, or other disposal device designed and installed according to standards of the City of Alma or the Bacon County Health Department may be permitted, and the most restrictive standards shall apply. 
                  (5)	Storm sewers. Storm sewers, catchbasins, and traps shall be provided in each subdivision. They shall be designed to carry not less than the stormwater from a rainfall expected to occur once in ten years with a runoff factor depending on the topography of the ground for other areas. Storm drainage design shall be based on Talbot's Formula. 
                  (6)	Curbs and gutters. Curbs and gutters shall be required in all subdivisions. Paved valley gutters may be permitted on grades over six percent. 
                  (7)	Variances or other improvements. Where the subdivider can show that a provision of these regulations would cause unnecessary hardship if strictly adhered to, and where, because of topographical or other conditions peculiar to the site, in the opinion of the planning commission, a departure may be made without destroying the intent of such provisions, the planning commission may authorize a variance. Likewise, if because of peculiar conditions or circumstances relative to a particular subdivision, the planning commission may require the installation of sidewalks, street trees or other improvements. Any variance thus authorized or additional improvement thus required is to be stated in writing in the minutes of the planning commission with the reasoning on which the variance or addition was justified set forth.

                  Sec. 82-65. - Findings and intent. 
                      This article is adopted to address the interest of public safety. Motorized carts, personal transportation vehicles, electric personal assistive mobility devices and other similar vehicles are not designed or manufactured to be used on public highways, streets and roads, (hereafter "public roads") and the city in no way advocates their operation on the public roads within its jurisdiction. Adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived is not to be relied upon as a determination by the city that operation of motorized carts, personal transportation vehicles, electric personal assistive mobility devices, low-speed vehicles, and other similar vehicles on public roads is safe or advisable if done in accordance with this article. By regulating such operation the city is merely addressing safety issues. All persons who operate or ride in motorized carts, personal transportation vehicles, electric personal assistive mobility devices, low-speed vehicles, and other similar vehicles on public roads do so with their own judgment and at their own risk, and must be observant of, and attentive to the safety of themselves and others, including their passengers, other motorists, bicyclists and pedestrians. Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the city has no liability in negligence, nuisance or under any other cause of action for losses resulting from the use of motorized carts, personal transportation vehicles, electric personal assistive mobility devices, low-speed vehicles, and other similar vehicles on roads, sidewalks, recreation paths, rights-of-way or other public property under this article. Any person who operates motorized carts, personal transportation vehicles, electric personal assistive mobility devices, low-speed vehicles, and other similar vehicles is responsible for procuring appropriate insurance as may be required by any state law or this chapter as a condition of operating motorized carts, personal transportation vehicles, electric personal assistive mobility devices, low-speed vehicles and other similar vehicles on the roads of the city.

                      Powers and duties of the board are: 
                  (1)	To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision or determination of the code enforcement officer in the enforcement of this chapter. 
                  (2)	To hear and decide applications for special exceptions of this chapter and for decision of any special questions upon which the board of appeals is authorized by this chapter to pass. 
                  (3)	To authorize upon appeal in specific cases such variance from the terms of this chapter as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this chapter will, in an individual case, result in unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of the chapter shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured and substantial justice done. Such variance may be granted in such individual case of practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship upon a finding by the board of appeals that: 
                  a.	There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape or topography; 
                  b.	The application of the chapter to this particular piece of property would create an unnecessary hardship; and 
                  c.	Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purpose of this chapter. 
                  Provided, however, that no variance shall be granted for a use of land or building or structure that is prohibited by this chapter. In exercising the above powers, the board of appeals may, in conformity with the provisions of this chapter, reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, or may modify the order, requirements, decision or determination of the code enforcement officer, and to that end shall have all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken and may issue or direct the issuance of a permit.
