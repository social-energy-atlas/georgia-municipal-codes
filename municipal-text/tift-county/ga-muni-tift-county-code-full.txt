PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a complete codification of the general and permanent ordinances of Tift County, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances adopted by the board of commissioners. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Palmer Carr, Supervising Editor, and Robert MacNaughton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida.

Such trust indenture may pledge or assign fees, tolls, revenues, and earnings to be received by the Authority. Either the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or such trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the Authority in relation to the acquisition of property, the construction of the project, the maintenance, operation, repair and insurance of the project, and the custody, safeguarding and application of all monies, and may also provide that any project shall be constructed and paid for under the supervision and approval of consulting engineers or architects employed or designated by the Authority, and satisfactory to the original purchasers of the bonds issued therefor, and may also require that the security given by contractors and by any depositary of the proceeds of the bonds or revenues or other monies be satisfactory to such purchasers, and may also contain provisions concerning the conditions, if any, upon which additional revenue bonds may be issued.

Except and to the extent permitted by Art. IX, Sec. III, Par. 1 of the Ga.

Either the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or such trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the Authority in relation to the acquisition of property, the construction of the project, the maintenance, operation, repair and insuring of the project, and the custody, safeguarding and application of all monies, and may also provide that any project shall be constructed and paid for under the supervision and approval of consulting engineers or architects employed or designated by the Authority, and satisfactory to the original purchasers of the bonds issued therefor, and may also require that the security given by contractors and by any depositary of the proceeds of the bonds or revenues or other moneys be satisfactory to such purchasers, and may also contain provisions concerning the conditions, if any, upon which additional revenue bonds may be issued.

In order to fulfill this duty, the chairman must enforce the rules of procedure that are adopted by the board of commissioners.

However, if for any reason the commission district member, who would be the board vice chairperson as determined by the sequential rotation outlined above, cannot serve then the vice chairperson position shall automatically be filled by the commissioner holding the seat of the next numerical district in ascending order and said replacement will serve the remainder of the unfulfilled term plus one upcoming full term. Furthermore, at no time will any commissioner serve more than a one year term, unless said commissioner has filled an unexpired term as described above, as vice chairperson. Once the commissioner holding the seat of the district with the highest numerical value has served, the rotation shall begin again with district one and rotate as provided herein.

If for any reason, less than six members of the board vote on any issue, the chairman shall also vote on said issue. 
(b)  In the case of a roll-call vote, the name of each person voting for or against a proposal shall be recorded in the minutes, and in all other cases it shall be presumed that the action taken was approved by each person in attendance unless the minutes reflect the name of the persons voting against the proposal or abstaining. 
(c)  A commissioner shall vote on all motions unless he has a conflict of interest which would prevent him from making a decision in a fair and legal manner.

(Ord. of 10-14-96, § 6) 
Sec. 2-381. - Action on complaints. 
(a)  Complaints against an employee. 
(1)  Upon receipt of a report of the investigation of a complaint of sexual harassment against an employee, the county administrator shall immediately review the report. If the county administrator determines that the report is not complete in some respect, he or she may question the person complaining of sexual harassment, the person against whom the complaint of sexual harassment has been made, witnesses to the conduct in question or any other person who may have knowledge about the conduct in question. The county administrator shall also keep written records of his or her investigation in the same manner prescribed for the investigator. However, if the county administrator feels that the investigation report is adequate, he or she may make a determination as to what, if any, corrective action is needed, based on the report of the county attorney. 
(2)  Based upon the report, his or her own investigation (when one is made) and consultation with the county attorney, the county administrator shall, within a reasonable time, determine both the conduct of the person against whom a complaint has been made warrants corrective action. In making that determination, the county administrator shall look at the record as a whole and the totality of the circumstances, including the nature of the conduct in question, the context in which the conduct, if any, occurred, and the conduct of the person complaining. The determination of whether corrective action is necessary will be made on a case by case basis. 
(3)  If the county administrator determines that the complaint is well founded, he or she shall take immediate and appropriate disciplinary action against the employee against whom the complaint has been made. 
(4)  The disciplinary action shall be consistent with the nature and severity of the offense. Disciplinary action may include demotion, suspension (with or without pay), dismissal, warning, or oral or written reprimand.

(b)  Complaints against an elected official. Upon receipt of a report of the investigation of a complaint of sexual harassment against an elected official, the board of commissioners shall immediately review the report. The board may conduct further investigation if it deems appropriate or necessary. Upon completion of review and investigation, the board shall discuss the complaint with the elected official against whom the complaint of sexual harassment is made. Such elected official shall be notified of the serious nature of the complaint and requested by the board of commissioners to cease any action which may be viewed as sexual harassment by any employee. 
(Ord. of 10-14-96, § 7) 
Sec. 2-382. - Duty of employees. 
(a)  Employees are obligated to report instances of sexual harassment and to cooperate in every investigation of sexual harassment. This obligation includes, but is not limited to, coming forward with evidence, both favorable and unfavorable, to a person accused of sexual harassment, fully and truthfully making a written report or verbally answering questions when required to do so by an investigator during the course of an investigation of sexual harassment; and to refrain from making bad faith accusations of sexual harassment. 
(b)  Disciplinary action may be taken against any employee who fails to report instances of sexual harassment, or who fails or refuses to cooperate in the investigation of a complaint of sexual harassment, or who files a complaint of sexual harassment in bad faith. 
(c)  It is recognized that the question of whether a particular action or incident is a purely personal, social relationship without discriminatory employment effect, requires a factual determination based on all facts pertaining to the incident. Given the nature of this type of discrimination, it is further recognized that false accusations of sexual harassment can cause serious effects on innocent women and men. Accordingly, false accusations will result in severe disciplinary action up to and including termination. The county trusts that all employees will continue to act responsibly to establish a pleasant working environment free of sexual harassment. 
(Ord. of 10-14-96, § 8)

A confirmation test must be different in scientific principle from that of the initial screening test procedure. This confirmation method must be capable of providing requisite specificity, sensitivity, and quantitative accuracy that is at least as accurate as the gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) method. 
(j)  Initial screening test. As used in this policy, an "initial test" or "initial screening test" is a sensitive, rapid and reliable procedure to identify negative and presumptive positive specimens.

(Ord. of 10-14-96, § II; Res. of 12-9-96, § 1) 
Sec. 2-397. - Policy. 
(a)  Zero tolerance policy. Tift County maintains a "Zero Tolerance Policy" toward unauthorized drug or alcohol use or possession which could affect its workplace. The county does not discriminate against persons on the basis of an individual's medical history of addition to either drugs or alcohol, so long as there is no evidence or indication of the individual's current abuse of such substances, nor of the individual's violation of this policy, nor any history of criminal activity involving such use. This nondiscrimination policy shall not apply to any refusal to hire, or other discrimination against any individual who has been convicted of any crime. Except as otherwise permitted in this policy, the use, possession, concealment, transportation, promotion, or sale of any drugs, unauthorized alcoholic beverages, or other illicit or chemical substances or of any unauthorized items by any person on county premises is strictly prohibited. Because of the medical difficulty of determining the precise amount of any chemical substance which may cause intoxication or impair a person's mental, sensory, or emotional faculties, any use of drugs or illicit chemical substances away from county premises on a person's off duty time shall be treated as a violation of this policy if it leaves any detectable amounts of the substance within the person's bodily fluids when that individual is on county premises on duty. Persons found with such substances in their bodily fluids shall be considered unfit for duty and shall be removed from county premises, and shall be subject to immediate termination. Compliance with this policy is a condition of employment. The failure or refusal of an applicant or employee to cooperate fully by submitting to any test or any procedure under this policy or by signing any consent form or other document required by the testing laboratory shall be grounds for refusal to hire or termination. 
(b)  Duty regarding noncompliance. All managers, supervisors and employees shall have the duty to take whatever lawful steps are necessary in order to ensure the compliance with this policy by all persons who are on county premises. Any person who knowingly permits another person to violate this policy without informing a superior officer, manager, or supervisor, or without taking other action to prevent such a violation shall be subject to discipline, including termination. 
(c)  Prescription drugs. Prescription drugs may be utilized by persons on county premises only under the following conditions: 
(1)  All prescription medicines must be stored in their original pharmacy container. No person may possess a prescription drug that is more than one year old. Employees whose medical conditions require the use of a syringe for the administration of insulin, or other medically-required substances must comply with the notification provisions set forth in subparagraph (c)(2). 
(2)  All persons using prescription drugs which are mood altering, mind or consciousness-affecting, or which are likely to have any effect upon the individual's perceptions, sensations, thought processes, self-awareness, emotions, or other mental or physical reactions or behavior while working shall inform their immediate supervisor of the name of the drug, the name of the prescribing physician, the date of the prescription, and the condition for which the medicine was prescribed, and shall execute, upon request, a release permitting the prescribing physician to release to the county's personnel director such information as is required to confirm that the employee is fit for duty and is in compliance with this policy. 
(3)  The county reserves the right at all times to require that such persons submit to an examination by the county's medical review officer, and to rely upon the advice, findings, or conclusions of the medical review officer in determining whether the individual is fit for duty. 
(d)  Drug testing. No drug test shall be administered to a candidate until after a job offer has been made to the candidate. No candidate to whom a job offer has been made shall be permitted to begin working until the candidate has taken and has passed a drug and alcohol screening test. All candidates shall be tested through urinalysis or other means for the presence of alcohol, drugs, or other illicit chemical substances in their bodily fluids. Any candidate who refuses to submit to such a test, or whose tests reveal the presence of such chemical substances shall not be considered for employment. 
(e)  Positive results. No test of any specimen found to be positive (i.e., indicating the presence of alcohol, drugs, or an illicit chemical substance) or which is suspected of having been adulterated, tampered with in the initial test, shall be considered conclusive unless it is first subjected to a second confirming test or analytic procedure used to identify the alcohol, drug or specific metabolite, using a different scientific principle from that employed in the initial test procedure. The confirming test shall be performed by a certified laboratory, and must be made using the gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) method, or an equivalent test method which must provide the requisite specificity sensitivity and quantitative accuracy which is at least equal to that of the GC/MS method, and must also be approved by NIDA, as such testing technology becomes available. 
(f)  Possession. Except as otherwise permitted in this policy, any person found to be in possession of drugs, alcohol, or other illicit chemical substances (other than in the person's bodily fluids) while on county premises, shall be terminated, if employed by the county. 
(g)  Searches and inspections for possession. The county reserves the right at all times on county premises, where it concludes circumstances which warrant such action, to conduct searches and inspections of employees and other persons for the purpose of determining whether such persons are in possession of, using, transporting, or concealing any of the prohibited substances or items covered by this policy; this shall include employee's lockers, baggage, desks, work areas, lunch boxes, brief cases, clothing, and vehicles (whether owned by the county or by the employee when the vehicle is located on county premises) using supervisors, managers, or authorized search and inspection specialists. Any evidence revealed in such a search will be utilized only for purposes of enforcing this policy, and will not be used by the county in any criminal prosecution of the employee. 
(h)  Unannounced testing. A search and inspection as defined in this policy may also include the requirement that employees and others submit to an unannounced urine drug screen test or blood plasma test, and also may include testing the individual's urine, breath, or blood for the presence of any of the prohibited substances or items covered by this policy. These tests may be utilized in the following circumstances: 
(1)  In employment medical examinations (before a candidate to whom an offer of employment has been extended begins working); 
(2)  As part of an overall search and inspection of an employee's working area, department, or work location as park of the county enforcement of this policy, or as part of a random drug testing program as set forth in this policy; 
(3)  When an employee's supervisor has reasonable suspicion or cause to suspect that an employee is using, or has used, drugs, alcohol, or other prohibited substances in violation of this policy, or is under the influence of drugs, alcohol, or other illicit chemical substances, based on objective and describable facts which would lead a reasonably prudent supervisor to believe that the employee is under the influence of an illicit chemical substance, or that the employee has otherwise violated this policy; 
(4)  When a person is found to be in possession of suspected illicit chemical substances, or when any of these substances or unauthorized items are found in an area which is controlled or used exclusively by the person; 
(5)  Following an accident, a serious work quality error apparently due to an employee's inattentiveness or serious judgment or perception error, an incident where safety precautions were violated, or whenever an employee has caused, contributed to the cause, or suffered an injury requiring medical attention or lost working time for any person, or where damage to property has resulted from an employee's job performance; 
(6)  As part of follow-up fitness for duty drug screening following reinstatement of an employee to duty following treatment of substance or alcohol abuse; 
(7)  An employee who submits to a drug screening test is entitled upon request, and at his sole expense, to have a portion of the urine or blood specimen submitted for testing to any other NIDA-certified laboratory which the county recognizes as having the competence, reliability, and expertise needed to perform an accurate analysis to determine the presence of such illicit chemical substances and to preserve and document the custody of the sample. The employee must make the request for the independent test not later than five working days after receipt of the written report of the test results, pursuant to subparagraph(h)(8) below; 
(8)  An employee will be notified in writing within five working days of the county's (or its medical review officer's) receipt of a written report revealing a positive test result. The employee will also be notified, not later than five working days of his receipt of the written positive test result notification, of his right to contest or explain the positive test results to the county's medical review officer. If requested by an employee or job candidate, the county will provide a copy of the test results to the employee. The employee will be reminded that if the sample he provided for testing was sufficient, he may, at his own expense, request a second confirmation test of a portion of the remaining sample by an NIDA-approved laboratory of the employee's choosing (provided the county recognizes the laboratory as equally competent with the laboratories it ordinarily uses for such tests). 
(9)  Both the initial screen test and the first confirmation test will be made at the county's sole expense. 
(h.1)  Employees shall be subject to a random selection process whereby employees will be selected and requested to be tested for use of controlled substances and alcohol. The selection method shall be scientifically valid and give each employee an equal chance of being tested each time selections are made. Under this program at least 50 percent of the county's employees will be subject to drug testing each calendar year, and at least 25 percent of the county's employees will be subject to alcohol testing each calendar year. An employee who is not discharged or permanently relieved of driving duties following a violation of this policy as it concerns alcohol may not resume driving duties without first passing an alcohol test. An employee who is not discharged or permanently relieved of driving duties following a violation of this policy as it concerns controlled substances may not resume driving duties without first passing a controlled substances test. An employee who has completed drug rehabilitation or a recommended course of treatment for alcohol abuse under this policy shall, upon resumption of duties, be subject to unannounced testing. Such testing shall be conducted over a period of 12 to 60 months and shall include at least six unannounced tests during the first 12 months of his/her return to duty. The type, frequency, and timing of such testing shall be at the direction of the county's human resources director, who may terminate the testing at any point after the first six tests under this provision. For drivers of county vehicles, each such unannounced alcohol test shall be administered either just before the driver is to perform driving duties or just after the driver has finished performing driving duties. Unannounced testing for alcohol for other employees, and unannounced testing for controlled substances may be performed at any time during the work day for all employees. 
(i)  Searches and inspections without prior notice. Searches (including urine drug screening or blood and plasma sampling) and inspections by investigate specialists or county supervisors may be conducted from time to time without prior notice to the employee. However, due consideration will be shown for the privacy interests of persons on county premises, subject to the objectives, and within the parameters of this policy. Evidence revealed in such searches (including drug screening or blood plasma sampling) will be utilized solely for purposes of enforcing this drug-free workplace policy, and will not be used in any criminal proceeding against the employee. 
(j)  Written consent; refusal. No person's body shall be searched, nor will any urine or blood and plasma drug screening test be administered without the written consent of the person being searched or tested. Any employee who refuses to provide such consent when requested, or to submit to a urine or blood plasma drug screening test, or to a search, or who is found to be in possession of such illicit chemical substances or unauthorized items shall be subject to termination. Any other person who refuses to submit to a search or a urine or blood and plasma drug screening test when requested pursuant to this policy will be barred from employment with the county, or from conducting business with the county and, where appropriate, may be excluded or removed from county premises and will not be permitted to return. 
(k)  Voluntary self-referral to EAP. 
(1)  The ultimate responsibility for eliminating addition or chemical dependency is solely that of the person affected by it. Nevertheless, the county's policy shall be to encourage employees with additive disorders or chemical dependency to seek proper medical and/or psychological treatment for the disease. It shall cooperate with the employee in obtaining such treatment, to the extent possible and within the limits of the county's medical insurance policy, medical leave of absence policy, and other benefit policies (including any employee assistance program that the county may maintain). The personnel director shall be responsible for informing such an addicted to employee of the programs, resources and benefits which are currently available for treatment for such a condition. 
(2)  No employee shall be terminated, disciplined, nor suffer any adverse employment action solely because he/she has sought referral to a county-provided benefit program for treatment of alcohol or substance abuse, or otherwise for having identified himself or herself as having a chemical addition or dependence, provided that the employee seeks the assistance in obtaining proper treatment for such addition or dependency before either testing positive or before the employee is involved in an incident (e.g. an accident or other behavior suggesting reasonable cause for suspecting the employee is impaired) which would ordinarily result in a search or testing under this policy. 
(3)  No employee who identifies himself or herself as being in need of such assistance before an incident leading to detection occurs shall suffer any discrimination in any term or condition of employment, including promotion and transfer opportunities solely because of his or her disclosure of such a condition, so long as the employee seeks such assistance and adheres to the treatment plan prescribed by his or her physician or other competent medical, psychological, or addiction counselor, and remains free of the illicit chemical substance, and so long as the employee is otherwise eligible, qualified, and entitled to the position. No employee who has successfully completed a drug or alcohol addiction treatment program shall be subject to any adverse or discriminatory treatment solely for having participated in such program so long as the individual remains drug and alcohol-free and otherwise complies with all the terms and conditions of this policy. The provisions of this section shall not apply to any individual to whom the provision of subsection (l) applies. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, the requirement that an employee who has returned to duty following completion of a drug or alcohol treatment program submit to more frequent unscheduled drug screening tests as a means of ensuring the employee's continued compliance with this program shall not be considered "adverse" or "discriminatory" treatment. 
(l)  Mandatory referral to EAP in lieu of termination. The provisions of this section shall apply only to persons who are already county employees. It shall not apply to any candidate failing the post-employment offer, pre-employment drug screening test, nor any persons who have resigned or retired from county employment. 
(1)  If any urine or blood plasma drug screening test reveals the presence of an illicit chemical substance in an employee's bodily fluids, the personnel director shall have the option (but not the obligation) in the first instance of such an occurrence, to refer the employee to the county's employment assistance program for assessment and treatment, if needed, at the sole expense of the employee. Such EAP referral shall be available only one time on a "last chance" basis. Any subsequent incident involving the use or possession of illicit chemical substances or materials under this policy will result in the employee's termination. 
(2)  To be eligible for such mandatory referral the employee shall be required to execute a consent and release permitting the personnel director to monitor the employee's participation and progress in any treatment or therapy program recommended by the EAP counselors. 
(3)  If the employee refuses to enter into such a program, or having once entered, fails to complete the program as directed by the addiction counselor, psychologist, or physician, the employee shall be terminated. 
(4)  If the employee successfully completes the treatment program and returns to work, he or she shall be subject to further unannounced drug screening tests not less than annually, as the personnel director determines is advisable under all the circumstances, for a period of not less than two years. 
(5)  The record of the particular incident which led to the drug screening test, shall not be used against the employee in a future decision if the employee successfully completed the treatment prescribed and maintains drug free status thereafter, and does not violate this policy. 
(6)  No person shall receive the benefits of this section more than one time, nor be excused from discipline or termination under the county's behavior and performance standards and policies merely because the employee's behavior or performance problem was caused by the employee's illicit chemical substance abuse. 
(m)  Confidentiality. All records of drug and alcohol screening tests results, all referral to or participation in the employee assistance program, and of any treatment for addictive disorders or diseases shall be maintained as strictly confidential employee personnel information which shall not be revealed to any person other than the personnel director, and those managers or supervisors having the need to know such information, the county's attorney's and the appropriate EAP counselor. Such information shall not be revealed under any circumstances to any other persons, employers, or prospective employers in any employment reference checks, nor to any other agencies, persons, or organizations unless the county is compelled by statute, regulation, or court order to reveal such information to such persons or organizations, or to defend itself in an action growing out of its enforcement of this policy. 
(n)  Authorized use of alcohol. Although Tift County does not encourage or condone the use of alcohol, moderate use of authorized alcoholic beverages (as defined above) during an individual's nonworking hours, in strict compliance with this policy and with all state and local laws and ordinances, and in a manner which ensures both that the individual will not be impaired when driving a county vehicle, nor when reporting to work, and that the individual is in compliance with prudent safety practices, will not be considered a violation of this policy. 
(o)  Education program. 
(1)  Employees. On not less than a biannual basis, every employee shall receive at least one hour of training on substance abuse in general, and its effects in the workplace including, but not limited to, the following: 
a.  The explanation of the disease model of addiction for alcohol and drugs; 
b.  The effects and dangers of the commonly abused substances in the workplace; and 
c.  The county's policies and procedures regarding substance abuse affecting the workplace, including how employees can obtain treatment for substance abuse. 
(2)  Supervisors. In addition to the education provided to employees, all supervisors will receive at least two hours of training which shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following: 
a.  How to recognize signs of employee substance abuse; 
b.  How to document and corroborate signs of employee substance abuse; and 
c.  How to refer substance abusing employees to the proper treatment providers through the county's employee assistance program. 
(p)  Severability. If any of the provisions of Tift County's policies and procedures on substance abuse, contraband articles, and employee assistance shall be held unconstitutional or otherwise invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction, the decision of such court shall not affect nor impair any of the remaining provisions.

Airport means the Henry Tift Myers Airport, Tift County, Georgia. 
Airport elevation means the highest point of an airport's useable landing area measured in feet above mean sea level. 
Airport hazard means any overhead power line which interferes with radio communication between a publicly owned aircraft approaching or leaving the airport or any structure or object of natural growth which obstructs the aerial approaches or the airspace required for the flight of aircraft in landing or takeoff at such airport or otherwise is hazardous to the use of such airport for landing or takeoff of aircraft. 
Airport primary surface means a surface longitudinally centered on a runway. When the runway has a specially prepared hard surface, the primary surface extends 200 feet beyond each end of that runway. The width of the primary surface of a runway will be that width prescribed in part 77 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) for the most precise approach existing or planned for either end of that runway. The elevation of any point on the primary surface is the same as the elevation of the nearest point on the runway centerline. 
Airport zoning chart means a chart or map of the area affected by the airport zoning, which shows the layout of the runways, the airport boundaries and the airport elevation. The chart also sets forth the various zones with the applicable height limitations for each, and identifies topographic features such as major streams, rivers, railroads, roads and streets. 
Airspace height means, for the purpose of determining the height limits in all zones set forth in this article and shown on the zoning map, the datum shall be mean sea level elevation, unless otherwise specified. 
Control zone means airspace extending upward from the surface of the earth which may include one or more airports and is normally a circular area of five statute miles in radius, with extensions where necessary to include instrument approach and departure paths. 
Decision height means the height at which a decision must be made during an ILS instrument approach, to either continue the approach or to execute a missed approach. 
Instrument runway means a runway having an existing instrument approach procedure utilizing air navigation facilities or area type navigation equipment, for which an instrument approach procedure has been approved or planned. 
Mean sea level means 355 feet. 
Minimum descent altitude means the lowest altitude, expressed in feet above mean sea level, to which descent is authorized on final approach or during circle-to-land maneuvering in execution of a standard instrument approach procedure, where no electronic glide slope is provided. 
Minimum enroute altitude means the altitude in effect between radio fixes which ensures acceptable navigational signal coverage and meets obstruction clearance requirements between those fixes. 
Runway means a defined area on an airport prepared for landing and takeoff of aircraft along its length. 
Slope means the relationship between a vertical distance and a horizontal distance perpendicular to the horizontal distance at the extremity thereof, e.g., a slope of 20 to 1 expresses the relationship of a horizontal line of 20 units measure (feet, yards, etc.) to a vertical line perpendicular thereto of one unit of the same measure (feet, yards, etc.). 
Structure means any object constructed or installed by man, including, but without limitation, buildings, towers, smokestacks, and overhead transmission lines. 
Visual runway means a runway intended solely for the operation of aircraft using visual approach procedures with no straight-in instrument approach procedure and no instrument designation indicated on an FAA approved airport layout plan, a military service's approved military airport layout plan, or by any planning document submitted to the FAA by a competent authority.

DIVISION 3. - REGULATIONS 

Sec. 18-81. - Height zones and limitations. 
(a)  Horizontal zone. The horizontal zone shall include all land lying under a horizontal plane 150 feet above the established airport elevation. The perimeter of the horizontal zone is determined by swinging arcs of 10,000 feet radii from the end of each of the perimeter surfaces of each end of each runway and by connecting the adjacent arcs by lines tangent to such arcs. No structure or object of natural growth shall be permitted in the horizontal zone that would penetrate such horizontal plane by extending 150 feet above the established airport elevation of 355 feet above mean sea level. 
(b)  Conical zone. The conical zone shall include all land lying under a plane extending outward and upward from the periphery of the horizontal plane at a slope of 20 to 1, for a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet. No structure shall be permitted in the conical zone area that would penetrate the conical plane. 
(c)  Approach zones. Approach zones include the land lying on a plane longitudinally centered on the extended runway centerline and extended outward and upward from each end of the primary surface. An approach zone is applied to each end of each runway based upon the type of approach for the runway end as follows: 
(1)  The inner edge of the approach surface is the same width as the primary surface of each runway, and the outer edge of the approach surface is 1,500 feet for runways 3, 9 and 21 and 3,500 feet for runways 15, 27 and 33. 
(2)  The approach zone extends for a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet for runways 3, 21 and 9, and 10,000 feet for runways 15, 27 and 33. 
(3)  The slopes for the approach zones are 20 to 1 for runways 3, 21 and 9, and 34 to 1 for runways 15, 27 and 33. 
No structure shall be permitted in any approach zone that would penetrate the slope for the particular runway. 
(d)  Transitional zone. The transitional zone contains the land lying under the planes extending outward and upward at right angles to the runway centerline and the runway centerline extended at a slope of 7 to 1 from the sides of the primary surface and from the sides of the approach surface. No structure shall be permitted that would penetrate the transitional zone. 
(e)  Primary surface. The primary surface includes an area with respect to each runway, the length of which is the length of the runway along the centerline thereof plus 200 feet on each end thereof along such centerline, and the width of which, measured from such centerline, is 500 feet for all runways and which extends vertically upward perpendicular from the ground indefinitely. No structure or object of natural growth shall be allowed within the primary surface area. For purposes of measurement and determination of other zones covered hereby, the elevation of any point in the primary surface is the same as the elevation of the nearest point on the runway centerline. 
(f)  Structures. No structure shall be permitted within three statute miles of the airport which would raise an existing published minimum descent altitude or decision height for any instrument approach to any runway at the airport, nor shall any structure be permitted within such three mile radius that would raise or increase the enroute altitude. 
(Ord. of 6-2-75, § 7) 
Sec. 18-82. - Use restrictions. 
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this article or the county zoning ordinance, no use may be made of any land or water within a three-statute-mile radius of the airport in such a manner as to interfere with the operation of an airborne aircraft. The following special requirements shall apply to each permitted use: 
(1)  All lights or illumination used in conjunction with streets, parking, signs or land and structures shall be arranged and operated in such a manner that it is not misleading or dangerous to aircraft operating from the airport or in the vicinity thereof. 
(2)  No operation from any use shall produce smoke, glare or other visual hazards within three statute miles of any runway of the airport. 
(3)  No operations from any use within three-statute-mile radius shall produce electronic interference with navigational signals or radio communication by the airport and aircraft. 
(Ord. of 6-2-75, § 8) 
Sec. 18-83. - Nonconforming use. 
The regulations prescribed in this article shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering or other change or alteration of any structure or object of natural growth not conforming to this article as of the effective date of the ordinance from which this section derives, or to otherwise interfere with the continuance of any nonconforming use. Nothing contained in this article shall require any change in the construction, alteration or intended use of any structure, the construction or alteration of which was begun prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this section derives. 
(Ord. of 6-2-75, § 9) 
Sec. 18-84. - Changes in nonconforming structures or objects of natural growth. 
Notwithstanding the provisions of section 18-83 or any other provisions of this article, before any nonconforming structure or object of natural growth may be replaced, substantially altered or repaired, rebuilt, allowed to grow higher, or replanted, a permit must be secured from the zoning administrator authorizing such replacement, change or repair. No such permit shall be granted that would allow the structure or object of natural growth in question to be made higher or become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was when this article was adopted. Whenever the zoning administrator determines that a nonconforming structure or object of natural growth has been abandoned or more than 80 percent torn down, destroyed, deteriorated or decayed: 
(1)  No permit shall be granted that would allow the structure or object of natural growth to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from this article. 
(2)  Whether application is made for a permit under this section or not, the zoning administrator may by appropriate action compel the owner of the nonconforming structure or object of natural growth, at such owner's expense, to lower, remove, reconstruct or equip such structure or object as may be necessary to conform to this article; or, if the owner of the nonconforming structure or object of natural growth shall neglect or refuse to comply with such order for ten days after notice thereof, the zoning administrator may proceed to have the object so lowered, removed, reconstructed or equipped, and assess the cost and expense thereof upon the owner of the structure, and/or the land upon which it is located. Unless such assessment is paid within 90 days from the service of such notice to the agent or owner of such object, structure or land, the sum shall bear interest at the rate of seven percent per annum until paid and shall be collected in the same manner as are general taxes. Except as indicated, all applications for permits for replacement, change or repair of nonconforming uses shall be granted. However, in granting any such permit, the zoning administrator may, if he deems such action advisable to effectuate the purposes of this article and as reasonable under the circumstances, condition such variance so as to require the owner of the applicable structure or object of natural growth to permit the county or other state, federal or local agency of government at its own expense to install, operate and maintain suitable obstruction markers and observation lights upon such structure or object of natural growth. 
(Ord. of 6-2-75, § 10) 
Sec. 18-85. - Lighting. 
Notwithstanding the provisions of this article, the owner of any structure over 200 feet above ground level must install on such structure lighting in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration Advisory Circular 70/7460-1C and amendments thereto. 
(Ord. of 6-2-75, § 11) 
Sec. 18-86. - Variances. 
(a)  Any person desiring to erect any structure, to increase the height of any structure, to permit the growth of any object of natural growth, or otherwise use his property in a manner which is in violation of or not in accordance with this article may apply to the county board of zoning appeals, hereafter known as board of appeals, for a variance to the standards and regulations set forth in this article. 
(b)  No application for a variance to the regulations and requirements of this article shall be considered by the board of appeals unless a copy of the application has been furnished to the county airport authority for advice as to the aeronautical effects of any such variance. If the county airport authority does not respond to the application for a variance within 15 days after receipt, the board of appeals may act on its own to grant or deny such application. 
(c)  Variances shall be allowed where a literal application or enforcement of this article's provisions will result in practical difficulty and unnecessary hardships and the relief granted would not be contrary to the public interests but would be in accordance with the spirit of this article. 
(d)  In granting any variance the board of appeals may, if it deems such action advisable to effectuate the purposes of this article and as reasonable under the circumstances, condition such variance so as to require the owner of the applicable structure or object of natural growth to permit the county or other state, federal or local agency of government, at its own expense, to install, operate and maintain suitable obstruction markers and observation lights upon such structure or object of natural growth.

Sec. 22-126. - Definitions. 
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this division, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
Approved means accepted by the county. 
Auxiliary water supply means any water supply on or available to the premises other than the purveyor's approved public potable water supply. These auxiliary waters may include water from another purveyor's public potable water supply or any natural sources such as a well, spring, river, stream, harbor, etc., or used waters or industrial fluids. These waters may be polluted or contaminated or they may be objectionable and constitute an unacceptable water source over which the water purveyor does not have sanitary control. 
Backflow means the flow of water or other liquids, mixtures, or substances under pressure into the distributing pipes of a potable water supply system from any source other than its intended source. 
Backflow by backpressure means the reverse flow of water caused when the downstream pressure becomes greater than the pressure in the potable water supply system. 
Backflow by backsiphonage means the flow of water or other liquids, mixtures or substances into the distributing pipes of a potable water supply system from any source other than its intended source caused by the sudden reduction of pressure in the potable water supply system. 
Backflow preventer means a device or means designed to prevent backflow, as follows: 
(1)  Air-gap means the unobstructed vertical distance through the free atmosphere between the lowest opening from any pipe or faucet supplying water to a tank, plumbing fixture, or other device and the flood level rim of said vessel. An approved air-gap shall be at least double the diameter of the supply pipe, measured vertically, above the top of the rim of the vessel, and in no case less than one inch. When an air-gap is used at the service connection to prevent the contamination or pollution of the public potable water system, an emergency bypass shall be installed around the air-gap system and an approved reduced pressure principle device shall be installed in the bypass system. 
(2)  Reduced pressure principle device means an assembly of two independently operating approved check valves with an automatically operating differential relief valve between the two check valves, tightly closing shutoff valves on either side of the check valves, plus properly located test cocks for the testing of the check and relief valves. The entire assembly shall meet the design and performance specifications and approval of a recognized and county-approved testing agency for backflow prevention assemblies. The device shall operate to maintain the pressure in the zone between the two check valves at a level less than the pressure on the public water supply side of the device. At cessation of normal flow, the pressure between the two check valves shall be less than the pressure on the public water supply side of the device. In case of leakage of either of the check valves the differential relief valve shall operate to maintain the reduced pressure in the zone between the check valves by discharging to the atmosphere. When the inlet pressure is two pounds per square inch or less, the relief valve shall open to the atmosphere. To be approved, these devices must be readily accessible for in-line maintenance and testing and be installed in a location where no part of the device will be submerged. 
(3)  Double check valve assembly means an assembly of two independently operating approved check valves with tightly closing shutoff valves on each side of the check valves, plus properly located test cocks for the testing of each check valve. The entire assembly shall meet the design and performance specifications and approval of a recognized and approved testing agency for backflow prevention devices. To be approved these devices must be readily accessible for in-line maintenance and testing. 
Building official means building official of the county. 
Contamination means an impairment of the quality of the potable water by sewage, industrial fluids or waste liquids, compounds or other materials to a degree which creates an actual hazard to the public health through poisoning or through the spread of disease. 
Cross connection means any physical connection or arrangement of piping or fixtures between two otherwise separate piping systems one of which contains potable water and the other nonpotable water or industrial fluids of questionable safety, through which, or because of which, backflow may occur into the potable water system. A water service connection between a public potable water distribution system and a customer's water distribution system which is cross connected to a contaminated fixture, industrial fluid system or with a potentially contaminated supply or auxiliary water system, constitutes one type of cross connection. Other types of cross connections include connectors such as swing connection, removable sections, four-way valves, spools, dummy sections of pipe, swivel or change-over devices, sliding multiport tube, solid connections, etc. 
Cross connection control by containment means the installation of an approved backflow prevention device at the water service connection to any customer's premises where it is physically and economically infeasible to find and permanently eliminate or control all actual or potential cross connections within the customer's water system; or it shall mean the installation of an approved backflow prevention device on the service line leading to and supplying cross connections which cannot be effectively eliminated or controlled at the point of cross connection. 
Cross connection control coordinator means the cross connection control coordinator of the county. 
Cross connections, controlled means a connection between a potable water system and a nonpotable water system with an approved backflow prevention device properly installed that will continuously afford the protection commensurate with the degree of hazard. 
Hazard, degree of means derived from an evaluation of the potential risk to public health and the adverse effect of the hazard upon the potable water system of the county. 
(1)  Hazard, contamination means any condition, device, or practice in the water supply system and its operation which could create or, in the judgement of the county, may create a danger to the health and well-being of the water consumer. An example of a health hazard is the structural defect, including cross connections, in a water supply system. 
(2)  Hazard, plumbing means a plumbing type cross connection in a consumer's potable water system that has not been properly protected by a vacuum breaker, air-gap separation or backflow prevention device. Unprotected plumbing type cross connections are considered to be a health hazard. 
(3)  Hazard, pollutional means an actual or potential threat to the physical properties of the water system or to the potability of the public or the consumer's potable water system, but which would constitute a nuisance or be aesthetically objectionable or could cause damage to the system or its appurtenances, but would not be dangerous to health. 
(4)  Hazard, system means an actual or potential threat of severe damage to the physical properties of the public potable water system or the consumer's potable water system or of a pollution or contamination which would have a protracted effect on the quality of the potable water in the system. 
Industrial fluids system means any system located within the unincorporated area of the county containing a fluid or solution which may be chemically, biologically or otherwise contaminated or polluted in a form or concentration such as would constitute a health, system, pollutional or plumbing hazard if introduced into an approved water system. This may include, but not be limited to: polluted or contaminated waters; all types of process waters and used waters originating from the public potable water system which may have deteriorated in sanitary quality; chemicals in fluid form; plating acids and alkalies, circulated cooling waters connected to an open cooling tower and/or cooling towers that are chemically or biologically treated or stabilized with toxic substances; contaminated natural waters such as from wells, springs, streams, rivers, bays, harbors, seas, irrigation canals or systems, etc.; oils, gases, glycerine, paraffins, caustic and acidic solutions and other liquids and gaseous fluids used in industrial or other purposes or for firefighting purposes. 
Pollution means the presence of any foreign substance (organic, inorganic, or biological) in water which tends to degrade its quality so as to constitute a hazard or impair the usefulness or quality of the water to a degree which does not create an actual hazard to the public health, but which does adversely and unreasonably effect such waters for domestic use. 
Water, potable means any water which, according to recognized standards, is safe for human consumption.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Secs. 46-1—46-35. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE II. - PHILLIPSBURG-UNIONVILLE REDEVELOPMENT PROGRAM 

Sec. 46-36. - Findings. 
(a)  Phillipsburg-Unionville is an urbanized area located in the county immediately south of the city limits of Tifton. The characteristics of this area are representative of both slum and blight. Predominately, the vast majority of the housing structures in the area are in various stages of deterioration. Also, the problems that exist as a result of overcrowding, poor drainage, inadequate sewage disposal, unpaved streets, and the lack of decent, safe and sanitary housing are quite evident. 
(b)  Regardless of the conditions mentioned in subsection (a) of this section, remarkable improvements have been made in the area over the past ten years. The county, with the assistance of funds from HUD, GRFA, EDA, FmHA as well as local funds, has extended sewer lines, improved drainage, paved streets and improved housing. However, much is left to be done. We find it necessary to implement a plan under the Urban Redevelopment Act as the county enters into a new phase of improvements involving the purchase and subsequent resale of property. The following plan describes the steps that will be taken to correct the deficiencies noted by the county and detailed in subsection (a) of this section. 
(Res. of 2-2-87, § A) 
Sec. 46-37. - Objectives of article. 
The objectives of the county redevelopment plan detailed in section 46-36 are compatible with the community development program currently operated by the county. The objectives are as follows: 
(1)  Provide adequate sewage disposal for all citizens in the redevelopment area; 
(2)  Bring the housing stock of the redevelopment area up to minimum standards; 
(3)  Improve the drainage system in the area; 
(4)  Pave residential streets in the area; and 
(5)  Acquire and demolish dilapidated houses in the area. 
(Res. of 2-2-87, § B) 
Sec. 46-38. - Resources. 
(a)  The county has demonstrated a willingness to spend local money in order to solve problems in the redevelopment area with the knowledge that their funds are limited. As a result of this, federal funds will be needed in order to make a true impact that will make the objectives in section 46-37 attainable. 
(b)  The first and of utmost importance are those funds that are derived from the community development block grant monies from the department of community affairs. EDA, FmHA and GRFA are other important agencies that have resources for potential use in the redevelopment area. At the present, GRFA funds are being used in conjunction with community development block grant and local funds in order to make needed improvements in Phillipsburg-Unionville. 
(Res. of 2-2-87, § C) 
Sec. 46-39. - Plan of action. 
(a)  Using a variety of the funds mentioned in this article, the county will continue to make significant improvements in the redevelopment area. The sewer system will be expanded until all homes are connected. Drainage improvements will be made and streets will be paved. Due to the establishing of a housing rehabilitation fund, rehabilitation of owner-occupied housing will continue. Also, the acquisition of dilapidated structures will not cease as long as funds are available to acquire and demolish such structures. 
(b)  In some cases, both the property and dilapidated structure will be acquired. When this should arise the property will be conveyed in such a manner as follows to ensure the county board of commissioners proper development of such property: 
Will to be a part of the deed 
This property is conveyed subject to the following restrictions: 
(1)  Declaration of reuse; i.e. residential, commercial, industrial. 
(2)  The property conveyed for redevelopment purposes under the provisions of O.C.G.A. § 36-61-10(a), and the second party shall not sell, lease, or otherwise dispose of such property without written consent of the board of commissioners until completion of the construction as stated in section (1). 
(3)  Construction of the redevelopment improvements shall be commenced by the second party within 180 days from the date of this deed. 
(4)  All requirements of O.C.G.A. § 36-61-10(b) have been complied with. Notices of sale were published in "The Tifton Gazette" on ;daterule; and ;daterule;, 19 ____________ . 
(c)  Any developer desiring to acquire property for redevelopment must state in his redevelopment bid package the intended use of the property. The redeveloper's reuse plan will in most cases make the deciding factor on bid awards; price alone cannot ensure a successful bid. 
(d)  If it is necessary to acquire dilapidated property by legal action, the property owner will first be given the opportunity to develop the property according to this plan. If the owner of the property is not willing to redevelop his property, the county may initiate legal action to acquire the property in question. 
(Res. of 2-2-87, § D) 
Sec. 46-40. - Coordination. 
This plan is in basic agreement with the county's community development goals and objectives, the land use plan, the areawide housing element and the areawide water/sewer plan. There are some inconsistencies with the county zoning ordinance and the intended reuse map, but these problems will be acted upon when necessary by the local planning commission.

(Am. of 11-14-16, § III) 
Sec. 58-34. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices. 
(a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the ordinance and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of section 58-34(b), (c) of this article. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit. 
(b)  Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
(1)  Best management practices as set forth in subsections (b) and (c) of this section shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act." As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
(2)  A discharge of storm water runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to of O.C.G.A 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
(3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-530(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs. 
(4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land-disturbing activities occur. 
(5)  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsection (c)(15) and (16), and (17) in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
(c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et. seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
(1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
(2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
(3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
(4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
(5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
(6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
(7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
(8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
(9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et. seq.; 
(10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
(11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
(12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
(13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
(14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments onsite or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection 58-34(b)(2)of this section; 
(15)  Except as provided in paragraph (16) and (17) of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or where bulkheads and sea walls are installed to prevent shoreline erosion on Lake Oconee and Lake Sinclair; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term 'ephemeral stream' means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow, unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
1.  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
2.  Stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
(16)  There is established a 50 foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
1.  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
2.  Stream crossings for sewer lines. 
(17)  There is established a 25-foot buffer along coastal marshlands, as measured horizontally from the coastal marshland-upland interface, as determined in accordance with chapter 5 of title 12 of this title, the "Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1970" and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where an alteration within the buffer area has been authorized pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-286, for maintenance of any currently serviceable structure, landscaping, or hardscaping, including bridges, roads, parking lots, golf courses, golf cart paths, retaining walls, bulkheads, and patios; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, where a drainage structure or roadway drainage structure is constructed or maintained; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, on the landward side of any currently serviceable shoreline stabilization structure, or for the maintenance of any manmade stormwater detention basin, golf course pond, or impoundment that is located entirely within the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. For the purposes of this paragraph maintenance shall be defined as actions necessary or appropriate for retaining or restoring a currently serviceable improvement to the specified operable condition to achieve its maximum useful life. Maintenance includes emergency reconstruction of recently damaged parts of a currently serviceable structure so long as it occurs within a reasonable period of time after damage occurs. Maintenance does not include any modification that changes the character, scope or size of the original design and serviceable shall be defined as usable in its current state or with minor maintenance but not so degraded as to essentially require reconstruction. 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activates on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner of his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to crossings for utility lines that cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet with the buffer, provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
c.  The buffer shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity conducted pursuant to and in compliance with a valid and effective land-disturbing permit issued subsequent to April 22, 2014, and prior to December 31, 2015; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented or any lot for which the preliminary plat has been approved prior to December 31, 2015 if roadways, bridges, or water and sewer lines have been extended to such lot prior to the effective date of this Act and if the requirement to maintain a 25-foot buffer would consume at least 18 percent of the high ground of the platted lot otherwise available for development; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
d.  Activities where the area within the buffer is not more than 500 square feet or that have a "minor buffer impact" as defined in 391-3-7-.01(r), provided that the total area of buffer impacts is less than 5,000 square feet are deemed to have an approved buffer variance by rule. Bank stabilization structures are not eligible for coverage under the variance by rule and notification shall be made to the division at least 14 days prior to the commencement of land-disturbing activities. 
(d)  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et. seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsection (b) and (c) of this section. 
(e)  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
(Am. of 11-14-16, § IV) 
Sec. 58-35. - Application/permit process. 
(a)  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
(b)  Application requirements. 
(1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of Tift County without first obtaining a permit from the Tift County Development Support Services/Code Enforcement Department to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
(2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the Tift County Development Support Services/Code Enforcement Department and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection (c) of this article. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land-disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of 54-34 (b), (c) of this article will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by two copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
(3)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
(4)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by section 58-34(c)(15) and (16) has been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per subsection (b)(6), have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
(5)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this article section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
(6)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
(c)  Plan requirements. 
(1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in section 58-34(b) and (c) of this section, or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this article. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and storm water management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land-disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
(2)  Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
(d)  Permits. 
(1)  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
(2)  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this article, any variances required by section 58-34(c)(15), (16) and (17) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per subsection 58-35 (b)(6) are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
(3)  Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this article, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
(4)  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
(5)  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this article. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
(6)  The LIA may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(f)(1). 
(Am. of 11-14-16, § V) 
Sec. 58-36. - Inspection and enforcement. 
(a)  The Tift County Development Support Services/Code Enforcement Department will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article. 
(b)  The local issuing authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within 12 months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975. 
(c)  The Tift County Development Support Services/Code Enforcement Department shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this article, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities. 
(d)  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
(e)  The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). The district or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
(f)  The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within 90 days after notification by the division, the division shall revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority. 
(Am. of 11-14-16, § VI) 
Sec. 58-37. - Penalties and incentives. 
(a)  Failure to obtain a permit for land-disturbing activity. If any person commences any land-disturbing activity requiring a land-disturbing permit as prescribed in this article without first obtaining said permit, the person shall be subject to revocation of his business license, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a business and associated work activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. 
(b)  Stop work orders. 
(1)  For the first and second violations of the provisions of this article, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have five days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within five days, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a stop-work order requiring that land-disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided, however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land-disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order in lieu of a warning; 
(2)  For a third and each subsequent violation, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop work order; and 
(3)  All stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. 
(4)  When a violation in the form of taking action without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer, or significant amounts of sediment, as determined by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee, have been or are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained, a stop work order shall be issued by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee. All such stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop work orders shall apply to all land-disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls. 
(c)  Bond forfeiture. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities has failed to comply with the approved plan, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to have forfeited his performance bond, if required to post one under the provisions of section 58-35(b)(6). The local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. 
(d)  Monetary penalties.

Editor's note— An ordinance adopted July 12, 2010, not being specifically amendatory of the Code, has been treated by the editor as superseding art. II, §§ 62-31—62-80, which had derived from an ordinance adopted April 6, 1987. 

DIVISION 1. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES 

Sec. 62-31. - Authorization. 
Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a) have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the county commission of Tift County, Georgia, does ordain as follows. 
(Ord. of 7-12-10) 
Sec. 62-32. - Findings of fact. 
(1)  The flood hazard areas of Tift County, Georgia, are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(2)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
(Ord. of 7-12-10) 
Sec. 62-33. - Statement of purpose. 
It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
(3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; and 
(4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; 
(5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters. 
(Ord. of 7-12-10) 
Sec. 62-34. - Objectives. 
The objectives of this article are to: 
(1)  Protect human life and health; 
(2)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(3)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; 
(4)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(5)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(6)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; and 
(7)  Insure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to two feet above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in section 62-45(6). 
(2)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles: Where base flood elevation data are available: 
a.  All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on: 
1.  Individual lots or parcels; 
2.  In new and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions; 
3.  In expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions; or 
4.  On a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than two feet above the base flood elevation. 
b.  Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than two feet above the level of the base flood elevation; or 
2.  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement (ref. section 62-46(6) above). 
d.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
1.  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; 
2.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions); or 
3.  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "new construction," including the anchoring and elevation requirements of section 62-47(a) and (c), above. 
(3)  Floodway: Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 62-35, are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
b.  Only if section 62-47(4)(a) above is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of division 4.

Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 62-36, where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A zones), or where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions apply: 
(1)  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 62-36, then the administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of division 4. Only if data are not available from these sources, then the following provisions (2) and (3) shall apply: 
(2)  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 20 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in more than a one-foot increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(3)  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than two feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 62-46(4), elevated buildings. 
a.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than two feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. 
b.  The administrator shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
(Ord. of 7-12-10) 
Sec. 62-49. - Standards for areas of special flood hazard (zones AE) with established base flood elevations without designated floodways. 
Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 62-36, where streams with base flood elevations are provided but no floodways have been designated, (zones AE) the following provisions apply: 
(1)  No encroachments, including fill material, new structures or substantial improvements shall be located within areas of special flood hazard, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community. The engineering certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles.

DIVISION 5. - VARIANCE PROCEDURES 

Sec. 62-53. - Variance procedures. 
(1)  The Tift County Zoning Board of Appeals as established by the county shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this article. 
(2)  The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the administrator in the enforcement or administration of this article. 
(3)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Tift County Zoning Board of Appeals may appeal such decision to the county superior court, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1. 
(4)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(5)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
(6)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(7)  In reviewing such requests, the board of zoning appeals shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article. 
(8)  Conditions for variances: 
(a)  A variance shall be issued only when there is a: 
1.  Finding of good and sufficient cause; 
2.  Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
3.  Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(b)  The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
(c)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(d)  The administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
(9)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the board of zoning appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
Mean sea level means the average height of the sea for all stages of the tide. It is used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain. For purposes of the national flood insurance program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are referenced. 
National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) as corrected in 1929 is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
New construction means, for the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the start of construction commenced after June 1, 1982 (the effective date of the initial FIRM), and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the start of construction commenced after September 10, 1979, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed after September 10, 1979. 
North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) has replaced the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 in existing and future FEMA flood modernization maps. 
Recreational vehicle means a vehicle which is: 
(a)  Built on a single chassis; 
(b)  Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection; 
(c)  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and 
(d)  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (NOTE: Accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance requirements.) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
Subdivision means the division of a single lot into five or more lots for the purpose of sale or development. Tift County Subdivision Ordinance article II, section 2-1.kk. as amended February 12, 2007. 
Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the start of construction of the improvement. (NOTE: The market value of the structure should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring.) This term includes structures, which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include (1) those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project, or (2) any alteration of a historic structure provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this article, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article. 
Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

(3)  Failure to comply with any part of this policy will result in serious adverse personnel action, including possible dismissal from employment.

(Mo. of 5-10-93(1)(B)) 
Sec. 86-68. - Procedure. 
(a)  Placement on agenda; opening. All public hearings on zoning matters shall be placed on the board of commissioners' agenda under a section entitled public hearings. The board of commissioners' chairman, or his designee, shall officially declare the public hearing open and shall note that the county's written public hearing procedures, the county's standards for exercise of zoning powers, and a copy of the state's conflict of interest law are available to the attending public as a handout and are posted for public review. 
(b)  Announcement of matter for consideration; report of zoning administrator; public input procedures. The zoning administrator and/or designee shall then announce the matter for consideration. The chairman shall then call for acknowledgement of a potential conflict of interest by members of the board of commissioners. The zoning administrator will then report the staff recommendation and the recommendation of the Greater Tift County Planning and Zoning Commission. The chairman shall then allow public input. General procedures to be followed will require citizen comments to be heard in an orderly fashion. Citizens speaking in favor of the request shall be heard first, followed by those opposed to the issue. All speakers will be asked to provide his name and address for the public record. Citizens are requested to keep their comments as brief as possible so that all who wish to be heard will have adequate time. When there is a large number of citizens wishing to testify at a given hearing, the presiding officer may invoke reasonable time limitations on both the proponents and opponents of a request. In such cases, these time limits shall apply to both sides of an issue equally. Citizens shall address their comments to the board of commissioners as a whole. Individual attacks or cross examination of commission members, county employees or other citizens will be ruled out of order. The board of commissioners retains the privilege to ask any questions of staff or any citizen present for clarification. 
(c)  Closing of hearing; consideration by board; rendering of decision; approval, denial, tabling. After all citizen comments have been received, all further discussion of the specific application is reserved for the board of commissioners. The chairman shall then declare the public hearing closed, and no further public comment will be entertained. The board of commissioners will then render a decision on the application. Decisions may include approval, denial or tabling of the decision to a time, place and date specific. In the case of tabling of a matter, no further public comment will be entertained upon further consideration of the matter. 
(d)  Basis for decision to table issue. When, in the opinion of the board of commissioners, the official public hearing has brought forth substantial new evidence or testimony not available to the Greater Tift County Planning and Zoning Commission at the time of their review of a zoning matter, or should the board of commissioners desire to request further study by the planning and zoning commission of a particular aspect of an application, it shall be the policy of the board of commissioners to table the issue and request that the planning and zoning commission restudy the issue and affirm or amend its recommendation, which action shall be reported to the board of commissioners prior to making a final decision. Under no circumstances will public comment be entertained by the board of commissioners following the closing of the public hearing.

Footnotes: 
--- (4) --- 
Editor's note— Copies of the forms referred to in this division are available in the office of the zoning administrator. 

Sec. 86-81. - General procedure. 
(a)  Violations brought to zoning administrator. Alleged violations of the county zoning ordinance typically are brought to the attention of the zoning administrator by routine field inspections by various county code enforcement personnel or by citizens' complaints. 
(b)  Filling out of form no. 1; assignment of case number. Once a complaint about an alleged violation has been received, zoning staff will fill out an enforcement inspection report (form no. 1) and assign a case number. This report may require additional background work such as identification of property owners, specific property location and size, as well as zoning classification in order to determine specific limitations or requirements for particular properties mandated by the county zoning ordinance. 
(c)  Field inspection. Staff will then, as soon as possible, make a field inspection of the alleged violation. Photographs generally should be taken if an alleged violation is noted in order to document field observations. It is generally recommended that field inspections of alleged violations be conducted by two members of the zoning/codes enforcement staff so that inspection report findings can be collaborated in case a specific case might require judicial review or action. 
(d)  Time constraint. Staff will attempt to complete steps 1, 2, and 3 in a timely fashion, but generally, these steps can be accomplished in 15 working days. 
(Ord. of 9-9-91(1)) 
Sec. 86-82. - First contact (voluntary compliance). 
(a)  Form no. 2; abatement request. If a violation is noted, staff will attempt to make personal contact with the violator, noting the specific actions required to abate the violation. Staff will specify a 15-workday period to correct the violation. A letter (form no. 2) will be sent providing appropriate information and requesting abatement within 15 working days. Dates and requirements, as well as suspense deadlines, will be logged on form no. 1. This letter (form no. 2) will be sent certified mail, return receipt requested. 
(b)  Request by violator for extension. If a violator requests extension of time to abate the violation, a 15-workday extension will automatically be granted. 
(c)  Reinspection. Staff will utilize a suspense file, and upon contact by the alleged violator, or upon completion of the 15-day waiting period, staff will reinspect the premises for abatement of the violation. Should the inspection indicate that the violation has been abated, the case file will then be closed. 
(Ord. of 9-9-91(1)) 
Sec. 86-83. - Second contact (matter requiring involuntary compliance); notice of violation (form no. 3); enforcement (form no. 4). 
Staff will review the case file to date and prepare a certified letter, return receipt requested, notice of violation (form no. 3). This notice will, like the first notice, allow 15 working days for abatement, and a followup field inspection is required. If not utilized during first contact procedure, a 15-workday extension can be granted, upon request by alleged violator, to allow time to abate alleged violation. If the violation has been corrected, the case file will be closed. If not corrected, enforcement action punchlist (form no. 4) will be prepared, an informational copy given to the county administrator, and a full copy of the file forwarded to the county attorney for formal action. 
(Ord. of 9-9-91(1)) 
Sec. 86-84. - Stay of enforcement. 
Filing of an appeal to determination of zoning administrator to the zoning board of appeals or filing of an application for rezoning with the board of commissioners will automatically stay enforcement until the appeal or rezoning question is resolved.

(6)  Availability of other means of travel to take place of vehicular traffic using roadway. (a) public transportation; (b) adjoining landowners' assistance; (c) neighborhood; (d) emergency vehicles; (e) garbage pickup; or (f) other. 
(7)  Benefit to public in continuing public usage of roadway (a) serves adjoining landowners; (b) serves neighborhood traffic needs; (c) provides access for emergency vehicles; (d) allows garbage pick-up and other services; and (e) other. 
(8)  Benefit to public in closing road. (a) eliminates road grading expense; (b) eliminates traffic movement hazards; (c) allows better land use plan for development of adjoining land; and (d) other. 
(9)  Adverse impact to public in closing road. (a) prevents landowner(s) from accessing public road; (b) interrupts comprehensive transportation plan project; (c) interrupts neighborhood to neighborhood transportation connection; and (d) other.

(h)  Review by planning commission: The planning commission shall review the preliminary plat, giving due consideration to the reviews of the staff development review committee and the director of roads and pubic works. The planning commission shall then recommend to the Tift County Commission for preliminary approval, conditional approval, postponement or disapproval within 30 days of submission. If after 30 days the planning commission has failed to act, the preliminary plat will be forwarded to the Tift County Commissioners for their action, unless the subdivider may waive in writing this requirement and consent to an extension of such period. 
(i)  Review by county commission: Final review of the proposed preliminary subdivision plat shall be made by the county commission at their next regular meeting. The zoning administrator shall be responsible for coordination of information to be brought before the county commission, which at a minimum shall include the recommendations of the staff development review committee, the director of roads and public works, the commissioner of health, and the recommendation of the planning commission. The county commission may grant preliminary approval, conditional approval, postponement of disapproval within 30 days of submission.

Lots shall not be sold nor shall building construction begin at this time. Preliminary approval grants the developer a maximum time of 18 months within which he shall submit his improvements plan and final plat for approval unless a time extension is granted by the county commission before the expiration of the 18-month period. If such time extension is granted, it shall be for not more than 12 additional months. Failure to submit improvements plan and final plat within this time period, including extension if any, shall invalidate preliminary plat approval, and require resubmission of preliminary plat. Additionally, if, in the opinion of the staff development review committee, substantial changes have been made to the approved preliminary plat, the revised plat shall be resubmitted as a new preliminary plat. 
(2)  Conditional approval by the county commission means the developer may proceed after written notice from the zoning administrator, as outlined under "preliminary approval" but only after he has submitted at least five copies of the corrected preliminary plan to the zoning administrator, noting thereon the condition or changes required by the approval of the county commission. 
(3)  Postponement by the county commission means action is delayed for specific reasons which shall be noted and transmitted in writing to the developer by the zoning administrator. Postponed preliminary plans may be reconsidered by the county commission without resubmittal to the staff development review committee, the director of roads and public works, the commissioner of health and the planning commission. 
(4)  Disapproval by the county commission means denial of the application for subdivision because the developer's plans are not in compliance with this article. For further consideration, the developer must rework and resubmit his plans as though they were a completely new preliminary plan. The specific reasons for disapproval shall be stated to allow for correction.

c.  Allowable leakage shall be no greater than as calculated in L-SD (P) ½/13,200 where L is allowable leakage in gallons/hour, S is the length of pipe tested in feet, D is pipe diameter in inches and P is test pressure during the leakage test in pounds per square inch (psi). 
(5)  Disinfection. 
a.  Disinfection of water mains. 
1.  All new water mains, as well as those taken out of service for inspection, repair or other activities that might lead to contamination of water shall be disinfected before they are placed in or returned to service. 
2.  Disinfection of the new mains and the disposal of the heavily chlorinated water following the disinfection shall be accomplished in accordance with the latest edition of AWWA Standard C651. 
3.  The "tablet method" of disinfection which consists of placing calcium hypochlorite granules or tablets in the water main as it is being installed and then filling the main with potable water when installation is complete is not allowed. 
4.  Before the main is chlorinated, it shall be filled to eliminate air pockets and shall be flushed to remove particulates. A flushing velocity of not less than 2.5 feet/second is usually maintained in pipe sizes less than 24 inches in diameter. For larger diameter mains, an alternative to flushing, such as broom-sweeping of the main, is acceptable prior to chlorinating the main. 
5.  During disinfection of the water mains, an appropriate cross-connection control device, consistent with the degree of hazard, shall be provided for backflow protection of the active distribution system. 
6.  The quality of the water used during the disinfection procedures shall meet the required drinking water standards. 
7.  The chlorine solution used for disinfection of water mains shall have a free chlorine residual concentration not less than 25 mg/L. This heavily chlorinated water shall be retained in the main for at least 24 hours, during which time all valves and hydrants shall be operated to ensure disinfection of the appurtenances. At the end of the 24-hour period, the treated water in all portions of the main shall have a residual of not less than 10 mg/L free chlorine. Rechlorinate if required results are not obtained on all samples. 
8.  After the applicable retention period, the heavily chlorinated water must not be disposed in a manner that will harm the environment. Neutralizing chemicals, such as sulfur dioxide, sodium bisulfite, sodium sulfite or sodium thiosulfate can be used to neutralize the chlorine residual remaining in the water to be wasted. 
9.  Flush all lines until residual is equal to existing system. After final flushing and before the water main is placed into service, water samples shall be collected from the main and tested for microbiological quality in accordance with the Georgia Rules for Safe Drinking Water, Chapter 391-3-5. The laboratory results must show the absence of coliform organisms in the water. Reflush and redisinfect the lines, as necessary, until satisfactory bacteriological results are obtained. 
b.  Disinfection when cutting into or repairing existing mains. 
1.  Shall be performed when mains are wholly or partially dewatered; 
2.  Shall follow the current AWWA C651 Standards, including trench treatment, swabbing with hypochlorite solution, flushing and/or slug chlorination as appropriate; 
3.  Bacteriological testing shall be performed after the repairs are complete. However, depending upon the circumstances, the water main may be returned to service prior to completion of testing to minimize the time the customers are out of service. 
4.  Leaks or breaks that are repaired with clamping devices while the mains remain full of water under pressure may require no disinfection. 
c.  Amount of chlorine necessary for disinfection. 
1.  Chlorine required to produce 25 mg/L concentration in 100 feet of pipe by diameter: 

 
Note: 1 percent chlorine solution may be prepared with sodium hypochlorite (contains five percent to 15 percent available chlorine) or calcium hypochlorite (contains approximately 65 percent available chlorine by weight). To prepare one percent chlorine solution using calcium hypochlorite, add one pound (454 grams) of calcium hypochlorite in approximately eight gallons of water. 
2.  Amounts and types of chemicals advised to be used for neutralizing various residual chlorine concentration in 100,000 gallons of water. 

 
(6)  Separation of water mains and sewers. 
a.  General. The following factors should be considered in providing adequate separation: 
1.  Materials and type of joints for water and sewer pipes; 
2.  Soil conditions; 
3.  Service and branch connections into the water main and sewer line; 
4.  Compensating variations in the horizontal and vertical separations; 
5.  Space for repair and alterations of water and sewer pipes; 
6.  Off-setting of pipes around manholes; 
7.  Water mains and sanitary or storm sewers shall not be laid in the same trench. 
b.  Parallel installation. Water mains shall be laid at least ten feet horizontally from any existing or proposed sanitary sewer, storm sewer or sewer manhole. The distance shall be measured edge-to-edge. When local conditions prevent a horizontal separation of ten feet, the water main may be laid closer to a sewer (on a case-by-case basis) provided the water main is laid in a separate trench or on an undisturbed earth shelf located on one side of the sewer at such an elevation that the bottom of the water main is at least 18 inches above the top of the sewer. It is advised that the sewer be constructed of materials and with joints that are equivalent to water main standards of construction and be pressure tested to assure water-tightness prior to backfilling. 
c.  Crossings. 
1.  Water mains crossing house sewers, storm sewers or sanitary sewers shall be laid to provide a separation of at least 18 inches between the bottom of the water main and the top of the sewer. At the crossings, one full length of water pipe shall be located so that both joints will be as far from the sewer as possible. Special structural support for the water and sewer pipes may be required. 
2.  When local conditions prevent a vertical separation of 18 inches, the sewer passing over or under water mains shall be constructed of materials and with joints that are equivalent to water main standards of construction and shall be pressure tested to assure water-tightness prior to backfilling. 
3.  When water mains cross under sewers, additional measures shall be taken by providing: 
(i)  A vertical separation of at least 18 inches between the bottom of the sewer and the top of the water main; 
(ii)  Adequate structural support for the sewers to prevent excessive deflection of joints and settling on and breaking the water mains; 
(iii)  The length of water pipe be centered at the point of crossing that the joints will be equidistant and as far as possible from the sewer; and 
(iv)  Both the sewer and the water main shall be constructed of water pipe materials and subjected to hydrostatic tests, as prescribed in this document. Encasement of the water pipe in concrete shall also be considered. 
(c)  Surface water crossings. Surface water crossings, both over and under water, may present special concerns and should be discussed with the division before the final plans are prepared. 
(1)  At above water crossings, the pipe shall be adequately supported and anchored, protected from damage and freezing, and accessible for repairs or replacement. 
(2)  At underwater crossings, a minimum of two feet of cover shall be provided over the pipe. 
(3)  The installation of ductile iron pipe with restrained push-on joints and encased in concrete, may be considered with the prior approval of the division.

f.  Solvent cemented joints are not allowed for buried pipes. 
g.  Detection tape shall be placed along all PVC water mains. 
(3)  Valve, air relief, meter and blow-off chambers. 
a.  Sediment accumulations may be removed through a standard fire hydrant. In addition, compressed air and pumping may be used for dewatering mains through hydrants. 
b.  At high points in water mains where air can accumulate, provisions shall be made to remove the air by means of hydrants or air relief valves. Automatic air relief valves shall not be used in areas where flooding of the manhole or chamber may occur. 
c.  The open end of an air relief pipe from automatic valves shall be extended to at least one foot above grade and provided with a screened, downward-facing elbow. The pipe from a manually operated valve should be extended to the top of the pit. 
d.  Chambers of pits containing valves, blow-offs, meters or other such appurtenances to a distribution system, shall not be connected directly to any storm drain or sanitary ewer, nor shall blow-offs or air-relief valves be connected directly to any sewer. 
e.  Such chambers or pits shall be drained to the surface of the ground where they are not subject to flooding by surface water, or to absorption pits underground. 
f.  Valves are to be placed at all intersections of water mains. Valves should be located at not more than 500 foot intervals in commercial districts and at not more than one block or 800 foot intervals in other districts. Where systems serve widely scattered customers, the valve spacing should not exceed 4,000 feet. 
g.  Valves shall meet the current AWWA Standards. 
(g)  Fire fighting. 
(1)  Fire hydrant flow. Aside from the general purpose of delivering water for fire fighting, the fire hydrant must be based on a number of operational elements. Some issues to consider include: 
a.  How much water (GPM or L/min) is needed for fire fighting. 
b.  How many and what size hose connections are required. 
c.  The established hose sizes and coupling threads in the region. 
d.  Current (and future) configuration of fire apparatus. 
e.  Issues of clearance and visibility. 
f.  Operating characteristics of the hydrants. 
g.  Amount of head (static pressure) that is present in the system. 
h.  Climatic conditions in the area. 
Generally speaking, water supply systems in residential areas should be designed to deliver no less than 1,000 GPM (3,785 L/min) at each individual hydrant. In commercial and multistory apartment zones, this volume should increase based on the required fire flows for the buildings being protected. If the required fire flows are several thousand GPM, the required flow will usually have to be met by two or more hydrants flowing simultaneously. 
(2)  Design criteria. While there are numerous published minimum standards, design criteria for water systems should be based upon the expected service needs over the life of a particular system. Storage and water delivery capacities should include peak domestic consumption combined with peak anticipated fire flows. Storage capacity should be sufficient to hold two days' peak domestic use plus a minimum of two hours of peak fire flow in ordinary hazard zones, and a minimum of three hours (or greater) in high hazard zones. 
Calculations for pipe sizing should take into account a minimum of 50 years subsequent community growth and its increased demands on the system. Over the life of a system it is less costly to install a proper system that has sufficient capacity for future community needs than it is to remove and replace pipes every few years. 
(3)  Water tanks and storage reservoirs. Water for fire fighting should be provided by gravity storage wherever possible. Using elevation as the means for developing proper water pressure in water mains and hydrants is reliable, not dependent on pumps that could fail or be shut down as a result of an electrical outage. Storage can be provided through one or more large storage reservoirs or by multiple smaller reservoirs throughout the community that are linked together. In determining the desired storage tank elevation, one can assume that every foot of head will produce 0.434 psi of pressure (1 meter of elevation will produce 9.813 kPa). Therefore to generate 65 psi (450 kPa) in the water distribution system, storage tanks must be located at an elevation of approximately 150 feet (45 meters) above the service area. Adequate system pressures are generally accepted to be between 65 and 85 psi (450 and 585 kPa). Accordingly, storage tanks should be placed at elevations between 150 and 200 feet (45 and 60 meters) above serve areas. Since most communities are not perfectly flat, there will be some variation in service pressure. While it may not be possible to establish a storage tank elevation to service most of a hilly community, it is often possible to design a system where the majority of the community falls within the 65 to 85 psi (450 and 585 kPa) range with pressures in some portions experiencing less desirable but acceptable ranges as low as 50 psi (345 kPa) and as high as 120. 
(h)  Street crossings. Open cutting of streets shall be allowed only where permitted by the county engineer. At locations where open cutting is not permitted, the crossing shall be made by boring or tunneling. Crossings may be boring or tunneling shall require a casing pipe unless otherwise approved by the county engineer. All work and materials shall be in conformity with all requirements of the technical specifications of Tift County. The diameter and length of the casing pipe to be used shall be as determined by the county engineer. All temporary surfacing shall consist of cold-mix asphalt at a minimum. 
(1)  Borings without casing pipe shall be a maximum size of two-inch pipe. Borings without casing pipe is used only with the recommendation of the design engineer and approval of the county engineer. Sand shall be blown into the bore hole to fill the remaining voids. 
(2)  Fire flow requirements. Public improvement plans for waterline projects serving development sites other than single-family or duplex subdivisions shall be reviewed for fire protection sufficiency as determined by the fire marshall for Tift County. The fire marshall shall determine the amount of water that is required for fire protection based on I.S.O. guidelines for the proposed type of structures to be built within the development. The design engineer shall obtain the flow requirement and then determine if the existing and proposed waterlines can provide this flow based on existing operating conditions. Calculations verifying that the required flows can be met shall accompany the drawings when submitted for approval. 
(i)  Water supply. 
(1)  Credit for the water system. For maximum credit in the schedule, the needed fire flows should be available at each location in the district. Needed fire flows of 2,500 gpm and less should be available for two hours, 3,000 and 3,500 gpm for three hours and all others for four hours. See the table at subsection (4). 
All AWWA standard hydrants within 1,000 feet of a building, measured as hose can be laid by apparatus, are credited; 1,000 gpm for hydrants within 300 feet; 670 gpm for 301 to 600 feet; and 250 gpm for 601 to 1,000 feet. Credit is reduced when hydrants lack a pumper outlet, and is further reduced when they only have only a single 2½-inch outlet. 
(2)  Credit for hydrants. For maximum credit in the schedule, all hydrants should have a pumper outlet, six-inch or larger branch connection, uniform size operating nut and should operate in a uniform direction. 
(3)  Credit for inspection and condition of hydrants. For maximum credit in the schedule, all hydrants should be inspected twice a year, the inspection should include operation and a test at domestic pressure. Records should be kept of the inspections. Hydrants should be conspicuous, well located for use by a pumper, and in good condition. 
(4)  Calculation of needed fire flow (NFFi). 
NFFi — (Ci)(Oi)(X+P)i 
When a wood shingle roof covering on the building being considered, or on exposed buildings, can contribute to spreading fires add 500 gpm to the needed fire flow. 
The needed fire flow shall not exceed 12,000 gpm nor be less than 500 gpm. 
The needed fire flow shall be rounded off to the nearest 250 gpm if less than 2,500 gpm and to the nearest 500 gpm if greater than 2,500 gpm. 
NOTE 1: For one-family and two-family dwellings not exceeding two stories in height, the following needed fire flows shall be used: 

 
NOTE 2: Other habitational buildings, up to 3,500 gpm maximum.

The city manager and county manager and their staffs shall cooperate in developing and implementing "basic extensions" and "system improvements" using the strategic plan adopted by the city council of the City of Tifton and the board of commissioners of Tift County as a general guide; but both the city council and the county board of commissioners must approve any revisions or modifications to the strategic plan as well as any "capital extension" or "economic extension." The terms set forth hereinabove related to extensions are hereby defined as follows: 
Basic water extension: Basic water or wastewater (i.e., sewer) extension is a customer requested extension, normally 1,000 feet or less, which accommodates an immediate development of a specific project. This extension is paid for by the customer, the developer or other external sources, but shall not be amortized into basic rates. 
Capital extension: Capital extension is a programmed/planned extension that is part of a long range capital improvement program for the water and/or wastewater system. The improvements to be constructed are to improve overall operation, enlarge customer base and service area, aid in economic development, and provide fire protection. These projects can be funded through SPLOST, capital revenues, and/or loans/grants. 
Economic extension: Economic extension is an extension to accommodate a proposed industrial, commercial, or residential customer. These extensions can be funded through capital revenues, SPLOST, loans/grants, and/or a private developer or individual.

The project may be an extension or replacement of an existing water or wastewater (i.e., sewer) main within the service area. The work is to improve overall quality, eliminate maintenance problems, or improve reliability of the water system. These improvements are to be paid for out of budget funds. 
(b)  All costs of easements, jacking and/or boring, fire hydrants or other related costs which may be required for the water or wastewater main extension are the responsibility of the applicant. The governing authority shall have no obligation or responsibility for the costs of any on-site facilities either inside or outside the corporate limits. 
(c)  All water main extensions shall include the installation of fire hydrants at a distance of not more than 600 feet apart unless otherwise approved by the fire official. The cost of the hydrants and related appurtenances shall be paid in accordance with the provisions herein and any applicable resolutions of the governing authority relating thereto. 
(d)  All water main extensions with hydrants attached or wastewater main extensions shall be of a minimum of eight inches. The governing authority may, in its discretion, require the installation of water or wastewater mains larger than eight inches, in which case the governing authority will be responsible for the additional costs directly resulting from the oversizing. 
(e)  Prior to any application being approved and the work authorized, the applicant shall pay all estimated costs required under the provisions of these regulations. Any difference between the actual and estimated costs of the extension, either upward or downward, shall be reconciled as necessary upon completion of the project. 
(f)  In the event that a water or wastewater main extension makes service available to other property owners abutting said extension, such other property owners shall be required to pay to the governing authority their proportionate share, if any, of the costs of the extension borne by the original applicant on a front foot basis before being permitted to connect to said extension. The charges collected will be refunded by the governing authority to the original applicant, but in no case will the refunds exceed the amount paid by the original applicant. Any refunds due to the original applicant will be paid, without interest, on March 31 and September 30, as appropriate. 
(g)  All liability for payment of refunds by the governing authority shall cease three years from the date of payment by the applicant for water or wastewater main extension. The assignment by the applicant of any money due under the provisions of this refund policy without the written consent of the governing authority is prohibited. 
(h)  In the event that a water or wastewater main is extended, either inside or outside the corporate limits, the costs of which is paid in part or in full by the governing authority, applicants who wish to connect to the main shall be required to pay a connection charge in addition to the meter installation fee as referenced in section 110-143. The connection charge shall be applicant's proportionate share, on a footage basis, of the governing authority's share of the cost of the extension. If the water or wastewater main installed is larger than eight-inch, the applicant shall be required to pay only its proportionate share of the cost of an eight-inch main. 
(i)  All water and wastewater mains extended under the provisions of these regulations shall become the sole property of the governing authority upon the connection with the city-county water system and shall thenceforth be maintained by the city-county governing authority. 
(j)  Anything in these regulations to the contrary notwithstanding, the governing authority in its sole discretion, shall have the right to disapprove any application for water service when it determines that it is not in its best interest to do so based on monetary or manpower constraints or on other considerations such as the unavailability of water or wastewater supply. Furthermore, the governing authority reserves the right to extend its water system on a planned basis in the best interest of orderly community-wide growth.

At least 15 but not more than 45 days' notice of the time, place and purpose of said hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation within Tift County, Georgia. Such notice shall also state the application number and date, and shall contain a summary of the proposed amendment, if a text amendment, and in the case of a map amendment, the location of the property, its area, the name of the owner or their authorized agent and the present and proposed zoning classification for the property affected. 
Further, such advertisement shall advise the public pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 36-67A-3 that any opponent of a proposed rezoning action who has made campaign contributions aggregating $250.00 or more to a local government official of the local government which will consider the application within two years of the date of the application shall be required to file a disclosure with the governing authority of the respective local government showing: (1) The name and official position of the local government official to whom campaign contributions were made; and (2) the dollar amount and description of each campaign contribution made by the opponent to the local government official during the five years immediately preceding the filing of the application for the proposed rezoning action and the date of each contribution. Such disclosure shall be required to be filed at least five calendar days prior to the scheduled hearing. 
b.  Notice to interested parties. A notice shall be given to the applicant and the planning commission of the date, time and place of the public hearing. All application files shall be placed in the custody of the zoning administrator and be open to public inspection during regular office hours. 
c.  Public hearing procedure. All public hearings on zoning matters shall be placed on the county commission agenda under a section entitled "public hearings." The county commission chairman, or his designee, shall officially declare the public hearing open and shall note that Tift County's written public hearing procedures, Tift County's standards for exercise of zoning powers and a copy of Georgia's conflict of interest law [O.C.G.A. § 36-67A-1 et seq.] are available to the attending public as a handout and are posted for public review. 
The zoning administrator and/or designee shall then announce the matter for consideration. The chairman shall then call for acknowledgement of a potential conflict of interest by members of the commission. The zoning administrator will then report the staff recommendation and the recommendation of the Greater Tift County planning and zoning commission. The chairman shall then allow public input. General procedures to be followed will require citizen comments to be heard in an orderly fashion. Citizens speaking in favor of the request shall be heard first, followed by those opposed to the issue. All speakers will be asked to provide his or her name and address for the public record. Citizens are requested to keep their comments as brief as possible so that all who wish to be heard will have adequate time. When there is a large number of citizens wishing to testify at a given hearing, the presiding officer may invoke reasonable time limitations on both the proponents and opponents of a request. In such cases, these time limits shall apply to both sides of an issue equally. Citizens shall address their comments to the county commission as a whole. Individual attacks or cross examination of commission members, county employees or other citizens will be ruled out of order. The commission retains the privilege to ask any questions of staff or any citizen present for clarification. 
After all citizen comments have been received, all further discussion of the specific application is reserved for the county commission. The chairman shall then declare the public hearing closed and no further public comment will be entertained. The county commission will then render a decision on the application. Decisions may include approval, denial or tabling of the decision to a time, place and date specific. In the case of tabling of a matter, no further public comment will be entertained upon further consideration of the matter. 
When, in the opinion of the county commission, the official public hearing has brought forth substantial new evidence or testimony not available to the Greater Tift County planning and zoning commission at the time of their review of a zoning matter, or should the commission desire to request further study by the planning and zoning commission of a particular aspect of an application, it shall be the policy of the commission to table the issue and request that the planning and zoning commission restudy the issue and affirm or amend its recommendation, which action shall be reported to the county commission prior to making a final decision. 
Under no circumstances will public comment be entertained by the county commission following the closing of the public hearing. 
d.  Standards for exercise of zoning powers. In order to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of Tift County against the unrestricted use of property, the following standards, and other factors relevant to balancing the above-stated public interests, shall be considered as they apply to any rezoning application brought before the county commission for decision: 
1.  The existing land use pattern; 
2.  The possible creation of an isolated district unrelated to adjacent and nearby districts; 
3.  The existing population density pattern and the possible increase or overtaxing of the load on public facilities; 
4.  Whether changed or changing conditions make the passage of the proposed amendment reasonable; 
5.  Whether the proposed change will adversely influence existing conditions in the neighborhood or the county at large; 
6.  Potential impact on the environment, including but not limited to drainage, soil erosion and sedimentation, flooding, air quality and water quality and quantity; 
7.  The reasonableness of the costs required of the public in providing, improving, increasing or maintaining public utilities, schools, streets and public safety necessities when considering the proposed changes; 
8.  Whether the proposed change will be detrimental to the value or improvement of development of adjacent or nearby property in accordance with existing requirements; 
9.  Whether the proposed change is out of scale with the needs of the neighborhood or Tift County; 
10.  Whether the proposed change will constitute a grant of special privilege to the individual owner as contrasted with the adjacent or nearby neighborhood or with the general public; and 
11.  The extent to which the zoning decision is consistent with local planning efforts of Tift County. 
e.  Public hearings records standards. The county clerk shall mechanically record the proceedings of all rolling public hearings. If requested by any party, verbatim transcripts of the public hearing can be prepared, but only if requested and purchased in advance by the requesting party, who must arrange at his expense for a certified court reporter to record and transcribe the hearing and furnish the original of the transcript to the commission for its records. The record of the public hearing and all evidence (e.g., maps, drawings, traffic studies, etc.) submitted at the public hearing shall be noted as such and shall become a permanent part of the particular zoning amendment's file.
