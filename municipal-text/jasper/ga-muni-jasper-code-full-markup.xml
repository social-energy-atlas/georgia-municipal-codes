PREFACE 
</p>
        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Jasper, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1979 Code, as supplemented through November 20, 1994, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1979 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation that represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves that stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Sandra S. Fox, Code Attorney, and Deborah J. Heath, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to John Weaver, Mayor; Ramona Roper, City Clerk; Tacie Jo Williams, Finance Director; Shane Sosebee, Grant Administrator; Michael Castagna, Planning and Development Director; and Lonnie Waters, Utility Development Planner, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances that will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

            <p>PART I - CHARTER AND SPECIAL ACTS                   Subpart A - CHARTER[1] 
                  Footnotes: 
                  --- (1) --- 
                  Editor's note— Printed herein is the most recent Charter of the city, as adopted by 1983 Ga. Laws (Act No. 14), p. 3534. The sequence of sections within each article are the same as in the act comprising it. Amendments to the Charter are indicated by history notes following amended provisions, except for 1957 Ga. Laws (Act No. 414), p. 3128, § 1, which amended the charter by directing that the word "city" be substituted throughout the charter for the word "town." That substitution has been accomplished without history note. Otherwise, the absence of a subsequent history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original act. Obvious misspellings have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes, a uniform system of headings, catchlines and citations to state statutes has been used. The title, enactment, severability, repealer, transitional, ratification, publication and effective date provisions have been omitted, and where a section has been amended or repealed by a later provision, only the current language has been printed. Additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets. 
                  State Law reference— Requirement for incorporation, dissolution, merger, or consolidation of municipalities by local act, O.C.G.A. § 36-35-2; standards for original incorporation, O.C.G.A. § 36-31-1 et seq.; limitations on local control by municipalities, O.C.G.A. § 36-34-1 et seq., O.C.G.A. § 36-35-1 et seq.; amendment of municipal charters, O.C.G.A. § 36-35-3(b), O.C.G.A. § 36-35-6; terms "city", "town", and "municipality" declared synonymous, O.C.G.A. § 36-30-1; municipal home rule, O.C.G.A. § 36-35-3; limitations on municipal home rule, O.C.G.A. § 36-35-6. 

                  ARTICLE I. - CHARTER, CITY LIMITS, AND CORPORATE POWERS 

                  Sec. 1.10. - Incorporation. 
                  This Act shall constitute the whole charter of the City of Jasper repealing and replacing the charter provided by an Act of the General Assembly, approved December 22, 1953 (1953 Ga. Laws (Act No.), p. 206) [1953 Ga. Laws (Act No. 837), p. 3120], as amended. The City of Jasper, Georgia, in the County of Pickens, and the inhabitants thereof are constituted and declared a body politic and corporate under the same name and style of Jasper, Georgia, and by that name shall have perpetual succession, may sue and be sued, may plead and be impleaded in all courts and in all actions whatsoever, and may have and use a common seal and change it at pleasure. 
                  Editor's note— The citation in the charter to the previous charter is incomplete and incorrect. The correct cite is 1953 Ga. Laws (Act No. 837), p. 3120, as provided in brackets. 
                  Sec. 1.11. - Corporate boundaries.

The corporate boundaries of the City of Jasper as set forth in the Act approved December 22, 1953 (1953 Ga. Laws (Act No.), p. 206) [1953 Ga. Laws (Act No. 837), p. 3120], as amended, are incorporated into and made a part of this charter, notwithstanding the repeal of said 1953 Act, as amended, by Section 7.17. The current boundaries of the City of Jasper, at all times, shall be shown on a map to be retained permanently in the city hall. Alterations in these boundaries shall be indicated by appropriate entries upon or additions to such map. Such entries or additions shall be made by and under the direction of the mayor. Copies of such map certified by the mayor shall be admitted in evidence in all courts and shall have the same force and effect as the original map. 
                  (b)  The city council may provide for the redrawing of any such map. A redrawn map shall supersede for all purposes the earlier map or maps which it is designated to replace.

                  Sec. 6-1. - Purpose. 
                  The purpose of this chapter is to regulate certain types of businesses, including, but not limited to, adult entertainment establishments, to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses will be curtailed; provided, however, it is recognized that such regulation cannot de facto approach prohibition; otherwise, a protected form of expression would vanish. As to adult dance establishments, this chapter represents a balancing of competing interests, reduced criminal activity and protection of the neighborhoods, through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments and patrons.

If the evidence for the city council shall demonstrate a violation is likely to continue which poses an immediate threat to the health, safety or welfare of any citizen, then it shall be grounds for an immediate suspension of the license pending a full administrative hearing on the issue. 
                  (b)  Regardless of whether immediate suspension of the license has been imposed, in the event of any violation of this chapter, the city staff shall provide written notice of the nature of the violations to the applicant/licensee not less than ten days prior to the hearing before the city council.

                  (d)  The enumerated periods of mandatory minimum suspension in this subsection shall be imposed and enforced for each violation determined by the city council as follows:

                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection 26-116(b)2. of this article; 
                  (15)  Except as provided in paragraph (16) of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal streamflow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the groundwater table year-round; for which groundwater is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow, unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the streambed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the streambed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal streamflow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the streambed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the streambed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines. 
                  (d)  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections 26-116(b) and (c) of this article. 
                  (e)  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
                  (Ord. of 7-12-2010(1), § IV) 
                  Sec. 26-117. - Application/permit process. 
                  (a)  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this ordinance [article], and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
                  (b)  Application requirements. 
                  (1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the City of Jasper without first obtaining a permit from the building and zoning department to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
                  (2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the building and zoning department and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection 26-117(c) of this article. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land-disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of subsection 26-116(b) and (c) of this article will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by two copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
                  (3)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(5)(a), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  (4)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by subsection 26-116(c)(15) and (16) has been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per subsection 26-117(b)(6), have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
                  (5)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this article section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
                  (6)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  (c)  Plan requirements. 
                  (1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in subsection 26-116(b) and (c) of this article, or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this article. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and stormwater management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land-disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
                  (2)  Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate Erosion, Sedimentation and Pollution Control Plan Review Checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
                  (d)  Permits. 
                  (1)  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
                  (2)  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this article, any variances required by subsections 26-116(c)(15) and (16) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per subsection 26-117(b)(6) are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
                  (3)  Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this article, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
                  (4)  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
                  (5)  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this article. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
                  (6)  The LIA may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(f)(1). 
                  (Ord. of 7-12-2010(1), § V) 
                  Sec. 26-118. - Inspection and enforcement. 
                  (a)  The building and zoning department will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article. 
                  (b)  The local issuing authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within 12 months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975. 
                  (c)  The building and zoning department shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this article, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities. 
                  (d)  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
                  (e)  The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). The district or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
                  (f)  The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to Code § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within 90 days after notification by the division, the division shall revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority.

                  Sec. 26-119. - Penalties and incentives. 
                  (a)  Failure to obtain a permit for land-disturbing activity. If any person commences any land-disturbing activity requiring a land-disturbing permit as prescribed in this article without first obtaining said permit, the person shall be subject to revocation of his business license, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a business and associated work activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. 
                  (b)  Stop-work orders. 
                  (1)  For the first and second violations of the provisions of this article, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have five days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within five days, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a stop-work order requiring that land-disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided, however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land-disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order in lieu of a warning; 
                  (2)  For a third and each subsequent violation, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order; and 
                  (3)  All stop-work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. 
                  (4)  When a violation in the form of taking action without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer, or significant amounts of sediment, as determined by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee, have been or are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained, a stop-work order shall be issued by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee. All such stop-work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop-work orders shall apply to all land-disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls. 
                  (c)  Bond forfeiture. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities has failed to comply with the approved plan, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to have forfeited his performance bond, if required to post one under the provisions of subsection 26-117(b)(6). The local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. 
                  (d)  Monetary penalties. 
                  (1)  Any person who violates any provisions of this article, or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant to this article, or who negligently or intentionally fails or refuses to comply with any final or emergency order of the director issued as provided in this article shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 per day. For the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this article, notwithstanding any provisions in any City Charter to the contrary, municipal courts shall be authorized to impose penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Notwithstanding any limitation of law as to penalties which can be assessed for violations of county ordinances, any magistrate court or any other court of competent jurisdiction trying cases brought as violations of this article under county ordinances approved under this article shall be authorized to impose penalties for such violations not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Each day during which violation or failure or refusal to comply continues shall be a separate violation.

                  Sec. 26-120. - Education and certification. 
                  (a)  Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspection or any land-disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on their level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
                  (b)  For each site on which land-disturbing activity occurs, each entity or person acting as either a primary, secondary, or tertiary permittee, as defined in the state general permit, shall have as a minimum one person who is in responsible charge of erosion and sedimentation control activities on behalf of said entity or person and meets the applicable education or training certification requirements developed by the commission present on site whenever land-disturbing activities are conducted on that site. A project site shall herein be defined as any land-disturbance site or multiple sites within a larger common plan of development or sale permitted by an owner or operator for compliance with the state general permit. 
                  (c)  Persons or entities involved in projects not requiring a state general permit but otherwise requiring certified personnel on site may contract with certified persons to meet the requirements of this article. 
                  (d)  If a state general permittee who has operational control of land-disturbing activities for a site has met the certification requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-19(b)(1), then any person or entity involved in land-disturbing activity at that site and operating in a subcontractor capacity for such permittee shall meet those educational requirements specified in O.C.G.A § 12-7-19(b)(4) and shall not be required to meet any educational requirements that exceed those specified in said paragraph.

                  (c)  Liability. 
                  (1)  Neither the approval of a plan under the provisions of this article, nor the compliance with provisions of this article shall relieve any person from the responsibility for damage to any person or property otherwise imposed by law nor impose any liability upon the local issuing authority or district for damage to any person or property. 
                  (2)  The fact that a land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
                  (3)  No provision of this article shall permit any persons to violate the Georgia Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act or the rules and regulations promulgated and approved thereunder or pollute any waters of the state as defined thereby.

                  ARTICLE I. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES 

                  Sec. 34-1. - Authorization. 
                  Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a) have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the Mayor and Council of Jasper, Georgia, do ordain as follows: 
                  (Ord. of 7-12-2010(2), Art. 1, § A) 
                  Sec. 34-2. - Findings of fact. 
                  (a)  The flood hazard areas of Jasper, Georgia, are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
                  (b)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
                  (Ord. of 7-12-2010(2), Art. 1, § B) 
                  Sec. 34-3. - Statement of purpose. 
                  It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; and 
                  (4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; 
                  (5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters. 
                  (Ord. of 7-12-2010(2), Art. 1, § C) 
                  Sec. 34-4. - Objectives. 
                  The objectives of this ordinance are: 
                  (1)  To protect human life and health; 
                  (2)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
                  (3)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas, 
                  (4)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
                  (5)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
                  (6)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; and 
                  (7)  To insure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

                  (Ord. of 7-12-2010(2), Art. 2, § D) 
                  Sec. 34-25. - Abrogation and greater restrictions. 
                  This ordinance [chapter] is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing ordinance, easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this ordinance [chapter] and another conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.

                  Sec. 34-27. - Warning and disclaimer of liability. 
                  The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur; flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the City of Jasper or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.

                  Failure to comply with the provisions of this chapter or with any of its requirements, including conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants of variance or special exceptions shall constitute a violation.

                  (2)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage; 
                  (3)  New construction or substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
                  (4)  Elevated buildings. All new construction or substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully-enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater. 
                  a.  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
                  1.  Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
                  2.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and

                  b.  So as not to violate the "lowest floor" criteria of this chapter, the unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area; and 
                  c.  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms. 
                  (5)  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
                  (6)  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces. 
                  (7)  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system; 
                  (8)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters; 
                  (9)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding; and 
                  (10)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure, which is not compliant with the provisions of this chapter, shall be undertaken only if the non-conformity is not furthered, extended or replaced.

                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and/or substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and/or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 34-71(4), "elevated buildings". 
                  a.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  (2)  Non-residential construction. New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH zones, may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in subsection 34-53(6). 
                  (3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
                  a.  All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on: (1) individual lots or parcels, (2) in new and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, (3) in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or (4) on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  b.  Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
                  1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation, or 
                  2.  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
                  c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (Ref. subsection 34-71(6) above) 
                  d.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
                  1.  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days. 
                  2.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick-disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions), or 
                  3.  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "new construction", including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsections 34-72(3)a—c., above. 
                  (4)  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 34-22, are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
                  b.  Only if subsection 34-72(4)a., above, is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of article IV.

                  Sec. 34-101. - [Variance procedures.] 
                  (a)  The planning and zoning board of appeals as established by city shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this chapter. 
                  (b)  The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the building official in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. 
                  (c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the planning and zoning board of appeals may appeal such decision to the Superior Court of Pickens County, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1. 
                  (d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (g)  In reviewing such requests, the planning and zoning board of appeals shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this chapter. 
                  (h)  Conditions for variances: 
                  (1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
                  b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  (2)  The provisions of this chapter are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (4)  The building official shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (i)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this chapter, the planning and zoning board of appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

                  National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) as corrected in 1929 is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
                  * New construction means, for the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced after 9/29/2010 [the effective date of the initial FIRM] and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced after 7/19/1993 [the effective date of the first floodplain management ordinance adopted by the community] and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
                  * New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed after 7/19/1993. [the effective date of the first floodplain management regulations adopted by a community]. 
                  North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) has replaced the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 in existing and future FEMA Flood Modernization Maps. 
                  Recreational vehicle means a vehicle, which is: 
                  (1)  Built on a single chassis; 
                  (2)  Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection; 
                  (3)  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light-duty truck; and 
                  (4)  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
                  Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. (Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (Note: accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance requirements) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
                  Subdivision means the division of a single lot into two or more lots for the purpose of sale or development. 
                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
                  Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the "start of construction" of the improvement. Note: The market value of the structure should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
                  For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include (1) those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project, or (2) any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure". 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. 
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  (5)  Notify law enforcement in the event that someone other than the customer has accessed the customer's account causing additional charges to accrue or accessing personal identifying information; or 
                  (6)  Take other appropriate action to prevent or mitigate identity theft. 
                  (b)  In the event that any city employee responsible for, or involved in, opening a new covered account becomes aware of red flags indicating possible identity theft with respect an application for a new account, such employee shall use his or her discretion to determine whether such red flag or combination of red flags suggests a threat of identity theft. If, in his or her discretion, such employee determines that identity theft, or attempted identity theft, is likely or probable, such employee shall immediately report such red flags to the city clerk. If, in his or her discretion, such employee deems that identity theft is unlikely or that reliable information is available to reconcile red flags, the employee shall convey this information to his or her supervisor, who may in his or her discretion determine that no further action is necessary. If the supervisor in his or her discretion determines that further action is necessary, a city employee shall perform one or more of the following responses, as determined to be appropriate by the supervisor:

                  Sec. 39-10. - Updating the program. 
                  The city council shall annually review and, as deemed necessary by the council, update the identity theft prevention program, along with any relevant red flags, in order to reflect changes in risks to customers or to the safety and soundness of the city and its covered accounts from identity theft. In so doing, the city council shall consider the following factors and exercise its discretion in amending the program: 
                  (1)  The city's experiences with identity theft;

Any recommended material changes to the program shall be submitted to the city council for consideration by the council. 
                  (1)  The HR coordinator will report to the city clerk, at least annually, on compliance with the red flag requirements. The report will address material matters related to the program and evaluate issues such as: 
                  a.  The effectiveness of the policies and procedures of city in addressing the risk of identity theft in connection with the opening of covered accounts and with respect to existing covered accounts; 
                  b.  Service provider arrangements;

                  Sec. 82-354. - Connection of private sewers to the public system. 
                  Whenever a private sanitary sewer line, whether truck or lateral, which services private residences or businesses, is to be connected into the city sewerage system, a hearing must be held before the city council before assessing each abutting property owner for a sewer tap fee. Notice shall be given to the affected property owners of the time and place of this hearing at least 20 days prior. The clerk of the water and wastewater department shall comply with the intent of this section by mailing all notices to the appropriate owners listed on the latest ad valorem tax digest of the county at the addresses indicated. Records of the water and wastewater department indicating the mailing of notices shall be prima facie evidence and failure of the owner of any property concerned to receive his notice shall in no way affect the validity of either the meeting or the assessments. If the property owners abutting the private sanitary sewer desire immediate connection and consent to paying the appropriate fees and assessments, then the connection shall be made without the necessity of a notice or a hearing.

                  Sec. 82-355. - Public hearing regarding connection of private sewer. 
                  At the hearing for the connection of the private sanitary sewer into the city sewerage system any person whose property or interests are affected may appear before the city council in person or through his agent or attorney. The city council shall determine whether or not the connection sought will provide a necessary service, and if the public welfare will profit from it. All evidence either in support or objection to the connection will be heard. The city council's decision shall be final and conclusive, and all fees or assessments levied against the abutting property owners as a result of the decision shall be legal and binding.

                  Whenever a person provides service to his own property by constructing a sanitary sewer line along any public road in the city or county, then if he desires cost refunds he must file an itemized cost sheet with the water and wastewater department. Then if property owners abutting this sanitary sewer desire connection within 25 years after constructing, provided they have not previously contributed to the sanitary sewer costs, the city may assess them on a prorated basis to recover expenditures. At the time the cost sheet is filed, the clerk of the water and wastewater department shall be responsible to ensure that all itemized values do not exceed the amount currently paid by the county for similar construction. If a cost sheet is not filed within six months after the completion, the city shall be relieved of any responsibility to collect from abutting property owners who desire future connection. All monies collected shall be refunded to the person, his successors, heirs, or assignees who constructed the original line. If the clerk cannot locate the person, his successors, heirs, or assignees after five years he may remit funds collected to the water and sewer fund.

                  (a)  When a petition for the construction of a sanitary sewer line has been filed on behalf of a person, or when a recommendation for construction has been made by the head of any board or department of the city, then a public hearing must be held before the city council. 
                  (b)  The clerk of the water and wastewater department shall notify the city council of the impending petition. He shall then give notice to all persons concerned by publication of a notice in the newspaper where sheriff's notices are published for a period of at least 20 days prior to the hearing. The notice shall state the date and location of the proposed public hearing and shall give a general description of the proposed sanitary sewer construction. 
                  (c)  When the clerk of the water and wastewater department has received the plans, specifications, and necessary engineering data with regard to an application for construction of sewer facilities, he shall determine the names of all property owners affected and procure the necessary right-of-way for construction of the sanitary sewer line as specified. Before final approval of any plans he must also ensure that sufficient stub-out connections are designated to adequately serve the territory affected. 
                  (d)  All owners of property abutting the proposed sanitary sewer line who shall be assessed for the cost of construction shall be notified in writing by the clerk of the water and wastewater department at least 20 days prior to the hearing. The clerk shall comply with the intent of this section by addressing all notices to the owners listed on the latest ad valorem tax digest of the county at the addresses indicated. The records of the water and wastewater department showing evidence of the mailing of these notices shall be prima facie evidence, and failure of the owner of any property concerned to receive his notice shall in no way affect the validity of the proceedings or the assessment. 
                  (e)  At the hearing provided for in this procedure any person whose property or interests are affected by the proposed sanitary sewer may appear before the city council either in person or through his agent or attorney. All evidence relevant to the question, whether in support or in objection, may be presented. 
                  (f)  The decision of the city council with respect to the approval or rejection of the proposed sanitary sewer shall be final and conclusive. Any decision by the city council in favor of the construction shall indicate a public need for the sanitary sewer, and this shall make all matters pertaining to the construction of the sanitary sewer and the assessment of costs against the abutting property owners legal and binding.

                  (a)  After the construction of a sanitary sewer line has been completed, the clerk of the water and wastewater department shall make up an assessment roll properly describing the sanitary sewer line and containing the names of all owners of abutting property. Each owner's property abutting the sanitary sewer shall be correctly described as it pertains to the construction. 
                  (b)  The cost of the sanitary sewer line shall be shared among the various property owners on a prorated basis depending on the number of linear feet each has abutting the sanitary sewer line. 
                  (c)  The actual assessment shall be calculated using a value in dollars and cents per linear foot based on the average cost for construction of all petitioned sanitary sewer lines in the city the previous year. 
                  (d)  The minimum assessment shall be for 65 feet whether or not a sanitary sewer line has to extend that distance to serve a property or not. 
                  (Code 1979, § 21-106.11) 
                  Sec. 82-451. - Certain specific computations. 
                  (a)  Whenever a tract of land abuts a sanitary sewer line on both the front and the rear, and the tract of land cannot be subdivided into two or more separate lots fronting each of the abutting sewers, then the property shall be assessed only for the side with the greater frontage. 
                  (b)  Several considerations shall be made before determining whether or not a tract of land can be subdivided. If the topography of the land makes it impractical to construct a building on one of the lots, or to provide sanitary sewer service to one of the lots, then the tract of land is not suitable for subdivision. 
                  (c)  Property owners who have contributed to the cost of existing sanitary sewers, whether by private contract, the original subdivision, or previous city assessment shall be exempted from current assessment. However, if property owners or previous owners did not contribute to the construction cost of existing sanitary sewers, they shall be assessed in the same manner as any other abutting property owner. 
                  (Code 1979, § 21-106.12) 
                  Sec. 82-452. - Assessment of corner property. 
                  Corner properties shall be assessed in the following manner: 
                  (1)  Where the sanitary sewer abuts the property only on the front, the property shall be assessed for the amount of frontage. 
                  (2)  Where the sanitary sewer abuts the property on both the front and side, the property shall be assessed for the frontage; the first 150 feet of the side abutting shall be exempted from assessment; the next 100 feet of the side abutting shall be subject to assessment; and the remainder of the side abutting beyond 250 feet shall be treated as outfall sewer and not assessed. 
                  (3)  Where the sanitary sewer abuts the property on the side only, the property shall be assessed for the frontage; the first 150 feet abutting on the sides shall be exempted; the next 100 feet of the sides abutting shall be subject to assessment; and the remainder of the side abutting beyond 250 feet shall be treated as outfall sewer and not assessed. 
                  (4)  Where the sanitary sewer abuts property that is pie-shaped or has an unusual frontage and that frontage is greater than the largest normal shaped and assessed property, the property will be assessed for the same number of front feet as the largest, normal shaped assessable property in the petitioned area. The clerk shall have the responsibility for determining what properties are to be considered pie-shaped or unusual.

                  Sec. 82-453. - Exception for outfall sewers. 
                  An outfall sewer is defined to be a section of sanitary sewer line, either in a public street or across private property, which normally does not provide direct service to the abutting property. Usually the outfall sewer is a section of a trunk sewer providing service to several street sanitary sewers serving properties. The cost of constructing an outfall sewer cannot be assessed against the abutting property owners; all expenses for laying and constructing this sanitary sewer shall be borne by the city.

                  Sec. 82-455. - Payment of assessments. 
                  (a)  Whenever a sanitary sewer line has been constructed in accordance with this article and the cost thereof has been assessed against the benefiting property, the respective owners shall be notified of the assessment and they shall be required to pay in cash within 60 days to the city the amount of the assessment. 
                  (b)  If the amount of the assessment causes a financial burden on the owner, then he may extend the assessment and pay it in annual installments. However, no less than one-fifth of the total assessment shall be paid within 60 days after notification. 
                  (Code 1979, § 21-106.16) 
                  Sec. 82-456. - Payment extension agreements. 
                  (a)  If the property owner requires an extension in the payment of his assessment, then he must execute in writing an extension agreement with the city council stating that he shall pay a 20 percent down payment and the remainder of the assessment in a maximum of four equal annual installments. 
                  (b)  The extension agreement must be executed on or before the due date of the assessment. 
                  (c)  In the agreement, the owner must acknowledge that throughout the term of the extension the assessment remains legal and valid, and all liens remain in force. 
                  (d)  The unpaid portion of the assessment shall bear current interest charges from the due date in the amount determined by resolution of the city council, and each annual installment shall include the portion of the assessment due and all interest accumulated through the date of payment of the installment. 
                  (e)  The agreement shall be negotiable in form, and the city shall reserve the right to transfer or assign it to third parties. 
                  (f)  If ever the owner defaults in the payment of any installment, then the entire assessment shall immediately become due and payable.

                  All assessments against property and the owners thereof for sanitary sewer construction shall be liens upon the property from the date the city council adopts the resolution authorizing construction. All assessments shall be posted in an improvement docket and kept on file in the water and wastewater department. Properties assessed shall be described in the docket in a manner sufficient to identify them with the section of the sanitary sewer they abut.

                  Should the owner of any property against which a sanitary sewer assessment has been levied fail to pay the assessment in cash within 60 days or to execute and timely pay an extension agreement as provided herein plus interest, then an execution shall be issued in rem against the property and in personam against the owner in the name of the city council. The execution shall be recorded on the general execution docket in the office of the clerk of the superior court and shall include sums to cover principal, interest, and administrative costs. All adjoining property owned by the same party or parties shall be covered in the execution.

                  Sec. 82-459. - Assessments after previous exemptions. 
                  (a)  The city council may grant property abutting sanitary sewer lines an exemption from assessment. Often this occurs when the city, by negotiating an easement, uses private property in the laying of a sanitary sewer line. Property thus exempted can be connected to the sewerage system at any future date without being liable for assessment. 
                  (b)  If, however, the property was exempted for another reason, such as the elevation of the property, and it is improved at a later date to a condition whereby sanitary sewer service can be attained and is required; then, if this occurs within 25 years after the completion of the sanitary sewer, the property is subject to assessment under provisions of this article. If the improvement occurs more than 25 years after construction, then the property may not be assessed.

                  Sec. 82-460. - Connection—By contributing consumers. 
                  (a)  After sanitary sewer lines have been constructed and tied into the county sewerage system, each abutting property owner who has contributed to the costs of construction through assessment may seek a service connection. 
                  (b)  To make such a connection, the property owner shall hire, at his own expense, a plumber or contractor to lay pipe from the building drain to the stub-out provided by the city. 
                  (c)  Before the service line can be connected to the sanitary sewer, the owner shall secure a permit from the city by paying a plumbing fee and a sewer tap fee; provided, the service line then passes the inspection criteria of the water and wastewater department, the owner may have it connected into the sewerage system. 
                  (d)  When no stub-out or other means of connection is provided so as to service the building drain, it shall be the responsibility of the water and wastewater department to provide a stub-out for the property owner at no cost. 
                  (e)  Sewer contractors shall not tap any sanitary sewer mains or manholes within the jurisdiction of the department without prior authorization from the department. 
                  (Code 1979, § 21-106.21) 
                  Sec. 82-461. - Same—By noncontributing consumers. 
                  (a)  When a property owner desires connection to the sewerage system within 25 years after construction of the sanitary sewer line, and he or a previous owner has not contributed to the cost of constructing the sanitary sewer line, he must pay to the water and wastewater department a proportionate cost of construction based on the footage his property abuts the sanitary sewer. After payment, the owner may construct a service line, pay a plumbing fee and a sewer tap fee, and, after the line has been inspected and approved, connect to the system. 
                  (b)  If the connection is desired more than 25 years after completion of the sanitary sewer main, then there is no assessment for construction costs, and only the appropriate plumbing and sewer tap fees are paid.

                  (Code 1979, ch. 47(intro. ¶)) 
                  Sec. 82-492. - Sewer. 
                  (a)  Pipe specifications. The following are minimum specifications for sewer pipes: 

                   
                  (b)  Material. The following are minimum specifications for materials used in sewer construction: 
                  (1)  Pipe. Pipes shall be constructed of the following: 
                  a.  Polyvinyl chloride: ASTM 3034 classifications SDR 35. 
                  b.  Ductile iron: Push-on joint class 350. 
                  (2)  Manholes. Manholes shall be precast as per ASTM C478 with the following specifications: 
                  a.  Four-foot inside diameter. 
                  b.  Five-inch wall thickness. 
                  c.  Plastic steps with three-eighths-inch rebar. 
                  d.  Cast-iron manhole frame and cover. 
                  1.  Inside roadway 460#. 
                  2.  Outside roadways 360#. 
                  (c)  Construction. Sewers to be laid in graded ditch on good material (rock or other unsatisfactory material shall be removed and good material brought in as required). Pipe shall be bedded in select material (good bank material, clay or crushed stone) well compacted. Backfill should continue with the same material, using hand tools, up to six inches above the top of the pipe. The balance of the backfill may be ditch material, providing it does not contain any large rock particles. 
                  (d)  House service connections. In general, house service connections shall incline upward approximately 45 degrees above a horizontal line normal to the direction of flow in the street main. Service lines shall be laid on a straight line and grade from the sewer or riser to the property line and in no event shall service lines be less than 3½ feet deep to invert of the pipe at the property line. Where required, short radius bends shall be used to connect the service branch to the house service line. Pipe service connections together with bends, shall be placed on a compacted bed of crushed stone in such a manner as to be self-supporting and to relieve the strain on branches and bends. 
                  (1)  Risers. Where trench depths are such that risers are required, service lines shall be installed by excavating into ditch bank and installing riser in a vertical position against undisturbed earth, and the entire length of the pipe containing the riser encased in concrete. Risers shall extend to the heights directed and shall be encased in a Sonotube fibre form as manufactured by Sonoco Productions Company or a brick masonry stack. Bends shall be used to connect the riser to the house service lines. 
                  (2)  Stoppers, caps and plugs. All house service connections shall be closed with factory manufactured pipe stopper of such design and secured in such a manner as to not leak under a maximum hydrostatic head of ten feet or five psi air pressure. The pipe stopper shall be able to be removed without special tools, excessive force or breakage of the pipe bell. 
                  (e)  Deflection testing for PVC pipe. The maximum deflection in the installed PVC pipeline shall not exceed five percent of the pipes original internal diameter. Deflection testing will be required using either a deflectometer or a "Go-no-go" mandrel. Portions of the project shall be randomly selected to be deflection tested. Such portions shall consist of not less than five percent of the total reaches (reach being length of pipe between two manholes) in the project (excluding house leads). Where deflection is found to be in excess of five percent of the original pipe diameter, the line shall be excavated to the point of excess deflection and carefully compacted and around the point where excess deflection was found. The line shall then be retested for deflection. However, should after the initial testing the deflected pipe fail to return to the original size (inside diameter) the line shall be replaced. In the event that deflection occurs beyond the five percent limit in any section of five percent or more of the reaches tested, the entire system shall be tested. 
                  (f)  Testing. On completion of each block or section of sewer, sewer shall be cleaned, tested and inspected. All repairs shown necessary by the inspection shall be made. Broken or cracked pipe shall be replaced; defective joints, if any, replaced; all deposits removed, pavement replaced; and AC sewer left true to line and grade, entirely clean, free from lumps or producing jointing materials, etc., and ready for use. Each section of sewer between manholes. shall show, upon examination from either end, a reasonably full circle of light. The allowable limit of groundwater infiltration for any one or more sections of sewer with any type joint allowable under these specifications (all sizes), shall not exceed 100 gallons per 24 hours per mile of sewer line per inch of diameter. Any line that does not meet this specification will be rejected and must be repaired. No infiltration tests will be made until normal infiltration conditions are established. Tests shall be made before existing sewers are connected and measured by means of a V-notch weir. These tests will be conducted over a period of time sufficient to determine the correct rate of groundwater infiltration. When infiltration occurs in excess of the specified amount as hereinabove given, defective pipe or joints shall be located and repaired. If the defective portions cannot be located as much of the original work as necessary to obtain a sewer within the allowable infiltration limits upon retesting shall be removed and reconstructed. 
                  (1)  Exfiltration test. When lines are above the groundwater table, an exfiltration test may be required. For this test, the line shall be filled with water under a minimum head of two feet above the top of the outlet pipe of the upper manhole and the level maintained through the test. The rate of exfiltration shall not exceed the allowable rate for infiltration, except that an allowance of an additional ten percent of gallonage shall be permitted for each two feet of head over the basic two feet minimum head. When the leakage exceeds the specified amount, satisfactory corrections shall be made. 
                  (2)  Low-pressure air test. Where sewer grades are such that preclude performance of the ex-filtration test, a low-pressure air test shall be conducted on each section of sewer after completion and before acceptance. Prior to air testing, the section of sewer between manholes shall be thoroughly cleaned and wetted. Immediately after cleaning or while the pipe is water soaked the sewer shall be tested with low-pressure air. Sewers may be tested in lengths between manholes or in short sections (25 feet or less) using Air-Lock balls pulled through the line from manhole to manhole. Air shall be slowly supplied to the plugged sewer section until internal air pressure reaches approximately 4.0 psi. After this pressure is reached and the pressure allowed to stabilize (approximately two to five minutes), the pressure may be reduced to 3.5 psi before starting the tests. If a 1.0 psi drop does not occur within the test time, then the line has passed the test. If the pressure drops more than 1.0 psi during the test time the line is presumed to have failed the test, and it will be required to locate the failure, make necessary repairs and retest the line. Minimum test time for various pipe sizes, in accordance with ASTM C828, as amended to date, is as follows: 

                   
                  Required test equipment includes: Air-Lock balls, air hose, air source, timer, rotometer as applicable, cutoff valves, pressure reducing valve, 0-15 pressure gauge; 0-5 pressure gauge with gradations of 0.1 psi accuracy of plus or equal to two percent. Keep records of all tests made. Copy of such records will be given to the owner. Such records shall show date, line number and stations, operator and such other pertinent information as required by the owner. Observe proper safety precautions in performance of the air testing. It is imperative that plugs be properly secured and that care be exercised in their removal. Every precaution shall be taken to avoid the possibility of over pressurizing the sewer line. 
                  (3)  Repairs. All visible leaks shall be repaired regardless of whether infiltration, ex-filtration or air test is within allowable limits. No sewer will be accepted until leakage tests demonstrate compliance with one of the above leakage test methods.

The chairman or his delegate may describe the authority and role of the planning commission in any zoning decision. An individual requesting to be heard on a manner germane to the purpose of the hearing must be recognized by the chairman or his delegate before addressing the planning commission. The chairman or his delegate shall chair the hearing and shall determine germaneness of any proposed comment or presentation to the planning commission in the hearing and is authorized to rule any individual or a portion of any presentation out of order if not germane to the published purpose of the hearing. Any person requesting to address the planning commission, upon being recognized by the chairman or his delegate, shall state his name and residence address before proceeding with any comment, remarks, or presentation. Any person addressing the planning commission shall respond to questions of the chairman or any member of the commission. The chairman or his delegate may predetermine the length of any hearing allotting equal time to proponents and opponents of any proposed zoning amendment to the extent that there are both proponents and opponents who desire to be heard. The chairman or his delegate shall only be required to offer equal time to both proponents and opponents of any proposed zoning amendment, and the fact that equal time is not in fact utilized by either position shall not invalidate any proceedings or action taken on the proposed amendment. The chairman, however, shall allow a minimum time period to be no less than ten minutes per side for the presentation of data, evidence, and opinion. The chairman shall have the power to recess to a time and place certain so long as a newspaper of general circulation in the city is notified as soon as practicable of the date, time, and place of the continuance of the hearing.

The chairman or his delegate shall confirm the giving of proper public notice of the hearing on the proposed zoning amendment in accordance with this article. 
                  (3)  The chairman or his delegate shall allow the person initiating the proposed zoning amendment or his designee to present a description of the proposed zoning amendment and the reason for initiating the proposed zoning amendment. A failure of the applicant or his representative holding power of attorney to be present for the hearing shall result in automatic termination of any proceedings on the amendment and an adverse recommendation on the proposed amendment shall be forwarded to the mayor and council of the city, unless the applicant can show just cause by reason of health emergency, in which case the application may be refiled by the applicant for consideration at a later date. 
                  (4)  The chairman or his delegate shall enter into the record after the presentation of the applicant or his representative any written comment, petition, or similar written statement received by the planning commission prior to the hearing, and the same shall be considered by the mayor and council with comments and proceedings of the hearing in making any zoning decision concerning the proposed zoning amendment. 
                  (5)  The chairman or his delegate shall give persons opposed to the proposed amendment the opportunity to address the planning commission. 
                  (6)  The chairman or his delegate may alternate the presentations of persons speaking in favor of and opposed to the proposed zoning amendment beginning with the presentation of the applicant or his representative, or the chairman or his delegate may divide such presentations into blocks of time beginning with proponents of the proposed zoning amendment, and thereafter moving to the presentations of opponents of the proposed zoning amendment. Further, the chairman or his delegate may direct that proponents and opponents designate one or more spokesperson for presentations of favorable and opposing views of the proposed zoning amendment. The chairman or his delegate may poll the public assemblage at the hearing concerning their concurrence in the remarks of any speaker. 
                  (7)  Any remark amounting to attack on the character or personal integrity of another individual, or comment not factually supportable, or comment in the form of an emotional outburst, shall be non-germane to the purpose of any hearing and may be ruled out of order. 
                  (8)  Upon conclusion of the presentation of persons opposing the proposed zoning amendment, the chairman or his delegate shall afford the person initiating the petition an allotted time to address the planning commission in rebuttal of any issue raised by persons addressing the planning commission in opposition to the proposed zoning amendment. The chairman or his delegate may rule out of order the raising of any new issue in rebuttal unless he deems the raising of such new issue useful to the purposes of the hearing and in which case those persons present and opposing the proposed zoning amendment shall be allocated an equal amount of time through a spokesperson or otherwise to address such new issue. 
                  (9)  When proponents and opponents of the proposed zoning amendment have been heard in accordance with the foregoing procedures, the chairman or his delegate shall declare the public hearing closed. No further public hearing on the proposed zoning amendment shall be required prior to the zoning decision.

                  Sec. 94-43. - Zoning standards. 
                  Exercise of the zoning power of the city shall constitute an effort to balance the interest of the community in promoting the public health, safety, morality, or general welfare against the right of property owners to the unrestricted use of their property. The following factors are determined to be relevant in balancing the interest in promoting the public health, safety, morality, or general welfare against the right to unrestricted use of the property. 
                  (1)  The following general standards shall be considered: 
                  a.  Whether the proposed amendment would allow a use that is generally suitable for the site compared to other possible uses and the uses and zoning of adjacent and nearby properties; 
                  b.  Whether the proposed amendment would adversely affect the economic value or the uses of adjacent and nearby properties; 
                  c.  Whether the property to be affected by the proposed amendment can be used as currently zoned; and whether the value of the subject property are diminished by the current zoning; 
                  d.  Whether the proposed amendment, if adopted, would result in a use which would or could cause an excessive or burdensome use of existing streets, schools, sewers, water resources, police and fire protection, or other utilities; 
                  e.  Whether the subject property under the proposed amendment is in conformity with the policies and intent of the adopted 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan for Pickens County, Jasper, Nelson and Talking Rock, as amended; and 
                  f.  Whether there are other conditions or transitional patterns affecting the use and development of the subject property, if applicable, which give grounds for either approval or disapproval of the proposed amendment; the length of time the property has been vacant as zoned considered in the context of land development in the vicinity of the property. 
                  (2)  The city shall consider any proposed zoning amendment properly initiated in light of the factors set forth in subsection (1) of this section. In evaluating the factors set forth in subsection (1) of this section, it shall be the policy of the city to exercise its zoning power in conformity with the policy and intent of the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan for Pickens County, Jasper, Nelson and Talking Rock, as amended, insofar as that plan is current in its application to the specific property that is the subject of the proposed amendment. It is further the policy of the city to exercise the zoning power for purposes of assuring the compatibility of the use of adjacent and nearby properties and the preservation of the economic value of adjacent and nearby properties while enabling a reasonable use of all property. 
                  (3)  In addition, the granting of a conditional use does not constitute a permanent change in zoning or use. The conditional use may be forfeited if it does not meet the review criteria. To ameliorate the impact of a conditional use on surrounding property, no conditional use may be granted without special provisions for conditions, criteria, standards, and, or requirements, as to that particular use. 
                  (4)  In addition to considering the standards of subsection (1) of this section, a permit for a conditional use shall be approved or denied, provided that due consideration is given to the following objective criteria as applicable to the specific use proposed at the specific site requested: 
                  a.  Whether the proposed use impacts negatively or positively the anticipated volume of traffic flow or pedestrian safety in the vicinity; 
                  b.  Whether the hours and manner of operation of the conditional use have no adverse effects on other properties/uses in the vicinity; 
                  c.  Whether refuse areas, parking, or loading/service areas on the property will be located or screened to protect other properties in the vicinity from noise, light, glare, or odors; 
                  d.  Whether the height, size, or location on the building or other structures on the property are compatible with the height, size, or location of buildings or other structures on neighboring properties; 
                  e.  Whether the size of the lot is sufficient for the proposed use, accounting for growth opportunity that will not infringe upon the requirements of this chapter nor infringe upon the relationship to surrounding land uses; and 
                  f.  If satisfying the foregoing criteria, whether the benefits of and need for the proposed use are greater than any possible depreciating effects and damages to the neighboring properties.

                  Sec. 94-44. - Official action. 
                  Consideration of any proposed zoning decision properly initiated and subsequent to the public hearing shall be as follows: 
                  (1)  The planning staff of the city shall make a recommendation to the Planning commission as to the advisability of adoption of any proposed zoning amendment. The recommendation of the planning staff shall be in writing addressed to the planning commission and shall clearly state the planning staff's advice. Further, the planning staff's recommendation shall provide an evaluation of each of the factors set forth in section 94-43(1) (or section 94-43(3), as applicable) and describe how the planning staff's advice is considered to be consistent with the exercise of zoning power set forth in section 94-43(2). A summary of the proceedings of the public hearing shall accompany the planning commission's written recommendation to the mayor and council. 
                  (2)  Upon conclusion of the public hearing, the planning commission may approve, disapprove, or table the proposed zoning decision. 
                  a.  The planning commission may recommend and the mayor and council may amend an application prior to acting thereon to: 
                  1.  Reduce the size of the area affected by the amendment; 
                  2.  Change the requested zone district to a less intensive or lower density district than the requested zone; 
                  3.  Specify as part of the zone district classification the particular use or uses requested by the applicant; or 
                  4.  Specify conditions that are deemed relevant to the public interest regarding site plans, ingress/egress, buffers, and infrastructure related to drainage, utilities, traffic, and other matters. 
                  b.  If the planning commission fails to recommend action on the zoning decision in writing within 45 days and the applicant does not agree in writing to a waiver of the this time limit, the applicant may take the proposed zoning decision to the mayor and council without a planning commission recommendation. 
                  c.  If consideration of the proposed zoning amendment is tabled, it shall be reconsidered by the planning commission not later than its next regular monthly meeting. In any event, the commission shall have 45 days from the date of the public hearing before the planning commission to hear, review, and submit its recommendation to the mayor and council. Once an application for a zoning decision has been filed and the planning commission holds a public hearing, the planning commission shall make a recommendation on the proposed zoning decision and the mayor and council shall take a final action, regardless that the applicant withdraws his application for the proposed amendment. 
                  (3)  The authority of the planning commission and planning staff in any zoning decision shall be advisory only. Any zoning decision shall be made by the mayor and council of the city, who shall either approve or disapprove the proposed zoning amendment. Any approval of a proposed zoning decision may be subject to any and all lawful conditions determined by the city council that are attached to the ordinance approving the proposed zoning decision. 
                  (4)  If the mayor and council shall take official action defeating a proposed zoning amendment which seeks to rezone property, the same property may not be considered again for rezoning until the expiration of 12 months from the date of the official action of the mayor and council.

                  Sec. 94-51. - Establishment of districts. 
                  (a)  Specific names. In order to carry out the intent and purpose of this chapter, the city is hereby divided into the following districts: 

                   
                  (b)  Description of each district name. The description of each district is as follows: 
                  (1)  Residential agriculture (R-A). The purpose of the R-A district is to permit a combination of low density residential uses of various types, limited agricultural activities and associated activities. 
                  (2)  Low density single-family residential (R-1). The purpose of the R-1 district is to accommodate purely low density single-family residential development and to protect such development from unrelated and incompatible uses. 
                  (3)  Medium density multifamily residential (R-2). The purpose of the R-2 district is to accommodate medium density multifamily and single-family residential development in locations that would serve as transitions between higher density residential land uses and single-family neighborhoods. 
                  (4)  High density multifamily residential (R-3). The R-3 district is designed to accommodate high density multifamily and single-family attached developments. These districts will be located in areas with convenient access to collector and arterial streets and can be developed as transitional uses between single-family districts and commercial districts. 
                  (5)  Office-residential (C-1A). The C-1A district is narrowly defined as a transition between intense commercial areas and residential uses generally oriented to major streets. These districts are typically located in areas that have a history of residential uses, but growth and community changes seek the changeover to low traffic, low impact commercial uses, often occupying residential-looking structures. New building construction shall only include architectural designs using brick, stone, and wood materials that are compatible with general residential patterns in the vicinity and will have a minimal depreciating effect upon adjacent uses. Subdued signage and exterior lighting are complemented by less than 12 hours of operation per weekday. 
                  (6)  Neighborhood commercial (C-1). The C-1 district is designed to provide a high quality environment for offices, institutions, or research and development facilities and the limited commercial activities that are compatible with a residential area. 
                  (7)  General commercial (C-2). The purpose of the C-2 district is to provide appropriate locations for a wide variety of commercial activities that will serve a large market area. Emphasis should be placed on creating commercial nodes or cluster developments rather than strip developments. 
                  (8)  Central business district (CBD). The CBD district is intended to provide for the orderly development and redevelopment of the central business district for commercial, financial, office, and related uses to serve the entire community and trade area. 
                  (9)  General industry (M-I). The purpose of the M-I district is to provide suitable areas for warehousing, distribution, manufacturing and other intensive activities of an industrial nature.

In all other cases, the district boundary line shall be determined by use of the scale appearing on the zoning district map. 
                  (b)  When the boundary line of a district divides a lot or tract held in single ownership at the time of the adoption of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, the boundary line may be allowed to extend a distance of not more than 50 feet to the least restricted zone district.

                  Sec. 94-106. - Determinations and requirements. 
                  (a)  In all situations, when two adjoining properties are in dissimilar zone districts as indicated in the table in subsection (b) of this section, the property within the zone district allowing more intensive uses is required to provide the buffer when acquiring a building permit unless the buffer was preexisting. When two adjoining vacant parcels are in dissimilar zone districts as indicated in the table in subsection (b) of this section, no buffer is required when the parcel zoned for the less intensive use acquires a building permit. 
                  (b)  A buffer shall be required whenever two adjoining properties are in dissimilar zone districts as shown in the following table:

                  Sec. 94-107. - Buffer design. 
                  All buffers required by this article shall conform to the following specifications: 
                  (1)  Buffer plan. Prior to development, a buffer plan shall be required to show the types and locations of all screening devices within a required buffer. 
                  (2)  Screening of service areas, etc. Landscaping within buffer areas shall be used to screen objectionable views or nuisances, such as parking and service areas, refuse containers, air conditioning units and transformers. 
                  (3)  Existing trees and plants. Existing on-site trees and shrub plants may be credited as meeting the requirements of this article if the enforcement officer determines that such plant materials achieve the purposes of this article. 
                  (4)  Buffer A design. Buffer A as required in the table in section 94-106(b) shall consist of plantings or a fence, wall (not otherwise part of a structure or accessory structure), or a berm, which meets the screening standards of subsection (7) of this section. 
                  (5)  Buffer B design. Buffer B as required in the table in section 94-106(b) shall have not less than a 20-foot base width and shall consist of plantings plus a fence, wall (not otherwise part of a structure or accessory structure), or a berm, or any combination thereof, which meets the screening standards of subsection (7) of this section. 
                  (6)  Plant screening method, 12-foot minimum. If plantings are the chosen method of screening, the planting area shall have a minimum base width of 12 feet. 
                  (7)  Screening standards. Screening is a method of visually shielding or obscuring one use from another by fence, walls, berms or densely planted vegetation. 
                  a.  Plantings. Plantings shall consist of either trees or shrubs or any combination of both. Planted areas shall be located along the abutting property lines or in areas that will provide the best screening effectiveness. If trees or large shrubs are used solely as the screening device, they shall be any evergreen species from the list provided by the enforcement officer which, under normal growing conditions, will attain a minimum height of six feet and a canopy spread of ten feet within three years. They shall be planted a minimum 20 feet on center. If trees are used in combination with shrubs, they may be of any species from the list provided by the enforcement officer. Small trees shall be planted 30 feet on center, and large trees 40 feet on center. Shrubs shall be any evergreen species from the list provided by the enforcement officer planted four feet on center. Shrubs shall initially be of any size, which would normally attain a minimum height of six feet within three years after planting. 
                  b.  Walls. Walls shall be of masonry construction and a minimum height of eight feet. The wall shall be placed on the edge of the buffer nearest the most intense land use. 
                  c.  Fences. Fences shall be a minimum of eight feet in height and constructed of standard wood fencing materials and methods or chainlink with woven inserts that will provide 90 percent visual blockage. The fence shall be placed on the edge of the buffer nearest the most intense land use. 
                  d.  Berms. Earthen berms shall have a minimum height of six feet. 
                  (8)  Variances. The requirements of this article may be waived by the zoning board of appeals, if it is clearly demonstrated that the existing topography and/or vegetation will achieve the purposes of this article; or it clearly demonstrated that for topographic reasons, no required screening device could possibly screen the ground level activities of dissimilar use from the first floor view of such a residential structure abutting the use.

Such surety shall be in the amount and form satisfactory to the enforcement officer and shall certify the following: 
                  (1)  The creditor does guarantee funds in an amount to cover the cost of installing all buffers as estimated and approved by the enforcement officer; 
                  (2)  In case of failure of the developer to complete the specified improvements, the creditor shall pay the government immediately, and without further action, such funds as are necessary to finance the completion of those improvements up to the limit of the secured credit; and 
                  (3)  The letter of credit or other surety may not be withdrawn or reduced in amount until released by the enforcement officer after final inspection and certification of approval of the buffer.

                  Any lot of record which is legal at the time of the adoption or amendment of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, may be used, subject to the following exceptions and modifications: 
                  (1)  Use of substandard lots. Where the owner of a lot at the time of the adoption or amendment of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, does not own sufficient area and width to enable him to conform to the dimensional requirements of this article, such lot may be used as a building site. 
                  (2)  Individual lot not meeting minimum lot dimension requirements. In addition to subsection (1) of this section, in any residential district, any lot of record existing at the time of adoption or amendment of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived which has a width or area less than that required by this chapter may be used as a building site for a single-family dwelling only. In the case of such a lot, when it is not possible to provide the required side yards and at the same time build a minimum width single-family dwelling, the zoning board of appeals is empowered to hear the request for a minimum variance. 
                  (3)  Adjoining lots. When two or more adjoining lots of record with continuous frontage are in one ownership at any time after the adoption or amendment of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived and such lots, individually, have an area or width that is less than required by this chapter, then such contiguous lots shall be considered as a single lot or several lots of the minimum width and area required in the zoning district in which they are located.

                  The following requirements apply to all developers and/or owners of real property involved with the erection, repair, alteration or removal of any building or structure, as well as the grading in anticipation of such development in the C-2 and M-l districts: 
                  (1)  Tree planting. 
                  a.  Street frontage planting requirements. A tree planting strip, exclusive of access driveways, with an average width of eight feet is required along all property lines abutting the public right-of-way. If large maturing trees are used, the planting strip shall include two trees with a minimum of two inches of caliper and eight feet in height in the first 40 feet and one tree per 40 feet thereafter or fraction thereof. If small maturing trees are used, the same conditions apply; but the increment drops to 30 feet. When a building permit is requested for renovation of a previously developed site and where the required perimeter strip does not exist, trees are still required. However, in lieu of an eight-foot-wide planting strip, a pavement cutout of a minimum of 80 square feet and with a minimum dimension of five feet may be substituted. This substitution, if so agreed upon by all parties, must be constructed within the designated front setback area for the particular property as set forth in this chapter. When a railroad or utility right-of-way separates the perimeter from a city right-of-way, the planting strip requirement and the tree planting requirements must still be met. 
                  b.  Internal lot planting requirements. Whenever the impervious cover exceeds 10,000 square feet, an area equal to five percent of the total impervious surface must be provided for landscape purposes and tree planting. Tree planting is required at the rate of one tree per 10,000 square feet of impervious cover. Trees must be planted within the paved area so that no parking space is more than 90 feet from a tree. Minimum unpaved landscape area per tree shall be 160 square feet with a minimum dimension of eight feet. When a building permit is requested for the renovation of a site previously developed, internal tree planting is still required; and the minimum planting area shall be 160 square feet per tree. Five percent of the total impervious cover must be open for landscape purposes. 
                  c.  Tree specifications. The trees to be planted must be from an approved list supplied by the city. Minimum tree caliper measured six inches aboveground on all trees shall be two inches, and the minimum height shall be eight feet. No trees identified as large maturing shall be planted within 20 feet of an electrical transmissions or distribution line. This does not include low voltage insulated or covered lines of 240 volts or less of telephone or cable vision lines. 
                  (2)  Utility responsibility. Public and private utilities which install overhead and underground utilities including CATV installations, and water and sewer by or at the direction of all utility departments shall be required to accomplish all work on property subject to this article in accordance with the company's written pruning and trenching specifications or as mutually agreeable to the property owner and the utility. Written specifications shall have been first, approved by the city council.

                  The following requirements apply to all properties in the city: 
                  (1)  All buildings, structures, grounds and storage areas shall be maintained free of insect and rodent harborage and infestation. Extermination methods and other measures to control insects and rodents shall conform with the requirements of the appropriate state regulatory authority. 
                  (2)  Lumber, pipe, and other building materials shall be stored at least one foot above the ground. 
                  (3)  Where the potential for insect and rodent infestation exists, all exterior openings in or beneath any structure shall be screened with appropriate wire mesh or other suitable materials. 
                  (4)  The growth of brush, weeds, and grass shall be controlled to prevent harborage of ticks, chiggers, and other noxious insects. Open areas shall be maintained as to prevent the growth of ragweed, poison ivy, poison oak, poison sumac, and other noxious weeds considered detrimental to health.

                  The location of freestanding communication towers may be permitted under the provision of this section. The intent of this section is to provide for the appropriate location and development of communication towers to serve the residents and businesses of the city; minimize adverse visual impacts of towers through careful design, sitting, landscape and innovative camouflaging techniques; and to encourage and promote the location of new communication towers in areas which are not zoned for residential use. The following are regulations for telecommunication towers and antennas: 
                  (1)  Height requirements. 
                  a.  For a single user, no more than 70 feet in height; 
                  b.  For two users, no more than 100 feet in height; and 
                  c.  For three users, no more than 150 feet in height. 
                  (2)  Rooftop-mounted antennas. Rooftop-mounted communications towers and antennas may be located on any nonresidential buildings and alternative tower structures in the city so long as: 
                  a.  Such tower or antenna is set back from any existing or planned off-site residence and separated from any residentially zoned property at least a distance equal to two times the full height of the tower and antenna, but in no event less than 100 feet; 
                  b.  The existing freestanding nonresidential structure other than a tower on which such tower or antenna will be placed is 50 feet in height or greater and the tower and antenna will add no more than 20 feet total to the height of said existing structure; 
                  c.  The number and location of antennas, communication towers or other receiving or transmitting devices located on a single structure that is not excessive and does not adversely affect adjacent properties and views. 
                  (3)  Safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity of communication towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes and the applicable standards for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries Association, as amended from time to time. Tower owners shall conduct periodic inspections of communication towers at least once every three years to ensure structural integrity. Inspections shall be conducted by a structural engineer licensed to practice in the state. 
                  (4)  Regulatory compliance. All towers and antennas must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the state or federal government with the authority to regulate communications towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed then the owners of the communications towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six months of the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a more stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal agency. Tower owners shall provide documentation showing that each communication tower is in compliance with-all federal requirements. Evidence of compliance must be submitted every 12 months. 
                  (5)  Security. Communication towers shall be enclosed by decay-resistant security fencing not less than six feet in height and shall be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device. 
                  (6)  Lighting. No illumination is permitted on an antenna or tower unless required by the FCC, FAA or other state or federal agency of incompetent jurisdiction in which case the planning commission may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding uses and views. 
                  (7)  Advertising. No advertising is permitted on an antenna or tower. 
                  (8)  Visual impact. 
                  a.  Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or subject to any applicable standards of the FAA or other applicable federal or state agency, be painted a neutral color, so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness. 
                  b.  At a tower site the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and built environment. 
                  c.  If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible. 
                  d.  Towers clustered at the same site shall be of similar height and design. 
                  e.  Towers shall be at a minimum height necessary to provide parity with existing similar tower supported antenna, and shall be freestanding where the negative visual effect is less than would be created by use of a guyed tower. 
                  (9)  Landscaping. Landscaping shall be used to effectively screen the view of the tower compound from adjacent public ways, public property and residential property and shall be as follows: 
                  a.  For towers 150 feet tall or less, a buffer area no less than six feet wide shall commence at the property line. 
                  b.  The buffer zone is to consist of materials of a variety which can be expected to grow to form a continuous hedge at least five feet in height within two years of planting. 
                  c.  Trees and shrubs in the vicinity of guy wires shall be of a kind that would not exceed 20 feet in height or would not affect the stability of the guys, should they be uprooted, and shall not obscure visibility of the anchor from the transmission building or security facilities staff and maintenance. 
                  d.  Native vegetation on the site shall be preserved to the greatest practical extent. The applicant shall provide a site plan showing existing significant vegetation to be replanted to replace that lost. 
                  e.  In lieu of these standards, the enforcement officer may allow use of an alternate detailed plan and specifications for landscape and screening, including plantings, fences, walls and other features designed to screen and buffer towers and accessory uses. The plan shall accomplish the same degree of screening achieved by the provisions above, except as lesser requirements are desirable for adequate visibility for security purposes and/or for continued operation of existing bona fide agricultural or forest uses such as farms, nurseries and tree farms. In certain locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, such as remote agricultural or rural locations or developed heavy industrial areas, the landscaping requirement may be reduced or waived by the planning commission.

                  Sec. 94-148. - Planned unit development (PUD). 
                  The intent of a PUD is to encourage flexible and creative concepts in site planning and building arrangements under a unified plan of development rather than under conventional lot by lot regulations. The developer benefits from better land utilization, economy in the provision of roads and utilities, and flexibility in design. The community benefits from efficient use of land. preservation of natural amenities and environmentally sensitive areas, and lower maintenance costs after development. Review and approval of the development plan provides the opportunity to ensure that the development will be in harmony with the character of the neighborhood in which it is located. Innovation and ingenuity in design are encouraged. 
                  (1)  Creation of a PUD. A PUD is a conditional use within the residential agriculture (R-A) zone district and exists after approval of a properly filed conditional use application. As such, a zoning decision is required per the requirements of this chapter. 
                  (2)  General development criteria. 
                  a.  Minimum site area. A minimum site area of 15 acres is required for consideration of a PUD. If the PUD proposes to contain commercial uses of any type, then the minimum site area shall be 50 acres or more. 
                  b.  Minimum lot area and yard requirements. Such requirements for each use may be waived upon the approval of a final site plan and subsequent final plats. 
                  c.  One principal building per lot. Lots developed for single-family detached dwellings shall have only one principal building per lot. 
                  d.  Multiple buildings per lot. Areas of the PUD that are dedicated to serving condominiums, townhouses, multifamily dwellings, or commercial buildings, if applicable, may have more than one building per lot. 
                  e.  Dwelling size minimum floor area. 
                  1.  Single-family detached dwelling, 1,400 heated square feet (excluding basements, finished or nonfinished, and any floor areas below ground level(s), heated or nonheated); 
                  2.  Single-family attached dwelling, 1,000 square feet; and 
                  3.  Multifamily dwellings, 800 square feet. 
                  f.  Separation of buildings. The minimum distance between all buildings shall be 20 feet, except for zero lot line developments which shall be ten feet. Such distances shall be measured from the outermost projection of the any part of the building. 
                  g.  Gross density. The maximum gross density in a PUD shall not exceed eight dwelling units per acre. 
                  h.  Parking/loading. Individual uses within the PUD shall comply with the parking standards as required in article IX of this chapter. 
                  i.  Streets/utilities. The application for a PUD shall stipulate whether the streets within the development are to be public or private. If the streets are proposed to be private, the developer shall submit a legal instrument or instruments setting forth a plan for the perpetual maintenance and repair of the proposed private streets. Regardless, whether the streets are publicly or privately owned and maintained, they shall be constructed to the minimum standards specified by the city. All PUDs shall be served by a public water system and a public sewage disposal system. 
                  j.  Ownership. A PUD site shall be under single ownership and/or unified control until developed. If upon application, the applicant does not have a full ownership interest in the land, then evidence of full ownership by a single individual, a partnership, tenants in common, a corporation, or by some other legal entity must be provided before final plats are approved. 
                  k.  Buffers. When the uses proposed within a PUD are adjacent to existing dissimilar uses outside the PUD, no matter whether city or county jurisdiction, a buffer is required for the PUD boundary, consistent with the table in section 94-106(b). In order to maintain the community environment that is created by the PUD concept, the perimeter of the PUD should generally require a minimum "buffer A" design, 12 feet wide, with a combination of plantings or a fence or wall or a berm. Separation of unlike uses within the PUD with a buffer is discretionary for the land developer. If due to the topography or other conditions, the review process determines that the buffer requirements of article VI of this chapter are not adequate, then additional buffer requirements may be recommended for cause. Similarly, the review process may also waive the buffer. 
                  l.  Signage. Signage within a PUD is limited to ground, window, or wall signs as defined by this chapter. Signage on the PUD perimeter is limited to only one round sign per entrance/exit to the development. 
                  m.  Open space requirements. Common open space shall comprise at least ten percent of the gross area of the PUD. The open space area shall be used for recreational or park facilities or undeveloped natural areas, which adds environmentally to the development and the collective enjoyment of the residents. Common open space shall not include public or private streets, parking areas, driveways, or utility rights-of-way, unless the latter also serves as a part of a developed trail system for walking, hiking, or equestrian usage. 
                  n.  Covenants. The entire PUD shall be included within private deed covenants running with the land to assure the continuance of the PUD in accordance with the approved plans. 
                  o.  Homeowners' association. A declaration of covenants and restrictions that will govern the creation and continuation of a homeowners' association shall be submitted with the final development plans. The homeowners' association shall be established before any lots/homes are sold and shall include provisions that: 
                  1.  Membership must be mandatory for each buyer and any successive buyer; 
                  2.  The open space restrictions are permanent, not just for a period of years, and the perpetual maintenance of the open space, private streets, and other communally held areas is assured; 
                  3.  The association must be responsible for liability insurance and local taxes; and 
                  4.  The financial assessment of the association must be adjustable to meet changing needs. 
                  (3)  Permitted uses. 
                  a.  Single-family detached dwellings. 
                  b.  Single-family attached dwellings. 
                  c.  Multifamily dwellings. 
                  d.  Zero lot line dwellings. 
                  e.  Neighborhood/community centers. 
                  f.  Schools and fire stations, with the concurrence from the county board of education or mayor and council of the city, respectively. 
                  g.  Churches. 
                  h.  Country club/club house/swimming pool/tennis/playgrounds. 
                  i.  Golf course/driving ranges. 
                  j.  Government buildings. 
                  k.  Utility facilities (water, gas, electric, telephone, cable). 
                  l.  Parks and recreations facilities, including equestrian facilities and lakes for swimming, fishing, and boating; trail systems. 
                  m.  Cemeteries (five acres or larger). 
                  n.  Commercial uses. 
                  1.  Pastry shops; 
                  2.  Book, card, and stationary stores; 
                  3.  Convenience stores with fuel service;

                  13.  Public and private clinics; 
                  14.  Retails stores offering general merchandise; 
                  15.  Restaurants; 
                  16.  Assisted living facilities. 
                  o.  Accessory uses. 
                  (4)  PUD implementation. 
                  a.  Major revisions of the PUD. Major or substantial changes in an approved PUD that affects the intent and character of the development, the density or land use pattern, the location or dimensions of streets, or similar substantial changes shall require the developer to submit a written request for revision of the plan and shall require a new public hearing to review such changes consistent with this chapter. 
                  b.  Construction permits. After approval of the PUD plan and recording of the final plat, the enforcement officer shall issue permits for grading and the buildings and structures if they are in substantial conformity with the approved development plan and other applicable regulations. No building permit for any approved commercial facility shall be issued until at least 25 percent of all planned residential dwelling units have received a certificate of occupancy. 
                  c.  Lapse of approval. Under the following two conditions, a PUD approval is voided: 
                  1.  Lack of construction. Approval of a PUD shall lapse one year from the date of the zoning decision by the mayor and council unless actual construction has been initiated or a request for an extension of one year is granted by the mayor and council. Not more than one extension shall be granted. 
                  2.  Default of the developer. If the developer should default regarding the implementation of an approved PUD, the approval shall lapse one year from the date of the default, unless another developer initiate efforts to continue the approved PUD plan within the one-year period. The revised schedule of construction shall be acknowledged and approved by the mayor and council.

                  Sec. 94-149. - Outdoor lighting. 
                  (a)  General provisions. 
                  (1)  Purpose and intent. This section is intended to reduce the problems created by improperly designed and installed outdoor lighting. They are intended to eliminate problems of glare and minimize light trespass, with regulations that avoid unnecessary direct light from shining onto abutting properties or streets. 
                  (2)  Definitions. For purposes of this article, the following terms are defined: 
                  Direct light means light emitted directly from the lamp, off of the reflector or reflector diffuser, or through the refractor or diffuser lens, of a luminaire. 
                  Fixture means the assembly that houses the lamp or lamps and can include all or some of the following parts: a housing, a mounting bracket or pole socket, a lamp holder, a ballast, a reflector or mirror, and/or a refractor or lens. 
                  Footcandle means a unit of illuminance on a surface that is everywhere one foot from a uniform point source of light of one candle and equal to one lumen per square foot. One footcandle (FC) is the equivalent of 10.76 Lux (1 Lux = 0.0929 FC). 
                  Full cutoff luminaire means outdoor light fixtures shielded or constructed so that no direct light rays are emitted by the installed fixture at angles above the horizontal plane. 
                  Glare means light emitting from a luminaire with an intensity great enough to reduce a viewer's ability to see, and in extreme cases causing momentary blindness, or that causes annoyance or discomfort. 
                  Illuminance means the area density of the luminous flux incident at a point on the surface. It is a measure of light incident on a surface, expressed in lux or footcandles. 
                  Isofootcandle plan means a site plan of a proposed development showing proposed outdoor illuminance with a series of isofootcandle lines that join points on a surface where the illuminance is the same. 
                  Light trespass means the shining of light produced by a luminaire beyond the boundaries of the property on which it is located. 
                  Luminaire means a complete lighting system, including a lamp or lamps and a fixture. This term shall be interpreted broadly as applying to all outdoor electrically powered illuminating devices, outdoor lighting or reflective surfaces, lamps and similar devices, permanently installed or portable, used for illumination or advertisement. 
                  Outdoor lighting means the nighttime illumination of an outside area or object by any manmade device located outdoors that produces light by any means. 
                  Safety lighting means exterior lighting that involves ensuring proper levels of illumination to provide safe working conditions, safe passage, and the identification of outdoor hazards. 
                  (3)  Applicability. All public and private outdoor lighting installed in the city shall be in conformance with the requirements established by this section. 
                  (b)  Exemptions. The following shall be exempt from the provisions of this section: 
                  (1)  All temporary emergency lighting needed by police or fire departments or other emergency services; 
                  (2)  All hazard warning luminaires required by federal regulatory agencies; 
                  (3)  All vehicular luminaires; 
                  (4)  Safety lighting, as defined in this section; 
                  (5)  All outdoor light fixtures producing light directly by the combustion of natural gas or other fossil fuels; 
                  (6)  Aesthetic lighting limited to interior roadway lighting with a maximum height of two feet within a development, not intended to take the place of required street lighting, or lighting to be utilized within open space used to feature decorative plantings, sidewalks, walkways, or ornamental objects, such as fountains or similar features. Aesthetic lighting, although exempt from an isofootcandle plan, shall be identified on all design plans as to type of light and location to ensure appropriate use of aesthetic lighting in accordance with this section. 
                  (c)  Outdoor lighting regulations. 
                  (1)  Cutoff fixtures. All luminaires not exempted from this section hereafter installed for outdoor lighting shall be full cutoff luminaires, as defined by this section, or another luminaire which does not emit any direct light above a horizontal plane through the lowest direct-light-emitting part of the luminaire. 
                  (2)  Glare. See chapter 26, sections 26-57(11). 
                  (3)  Intensity specifications. Illuminance levels for outdoor lighting fixtures shall comply with the standards in table 1-1, measured at three feet above the ground or finished grade.

                  (d)  Lighting plan required. A lighting plan, approved by the planning and zoning director, shall be required for all nonsingle-family residential developments of three acres or more in size, and for community recreation, as defined, when lighting is proposed. It is the intent of this section that small sites with a limited number of fixtures should be exempted from preparing and submitting a professional lighting plan, and that the zoning director will exercise discretion to provide such relief where appropriate. When required, lighting plans shall illustrate proposed lighting. The plan shall show areas of night illumination and the amount of light at various places measured in footcandles. When required, the lighting plan shall consist of either isofootcandles (connecting points of equal light illumination levels, similar to a topographic contour) or a photometric grid with individual spot readings. No lighting plan shall be approved which will result in direct light that exceeds the requirements or is otherwise inconsistent with this section. Appeals for any plan not approved by the planning and zoning director shall be made to the mayor. Any further appeal shall be made to the city council. 
                  (e)  Type of lighting. Unless otherwise approved by the planning and zoning director, outdoor lighting shall be incandescent or high pressure sodium. 
                  (f)  Recommended practice. The planning and zoning director should consider and apply the following design standard in their review of outdoor lighting plans: 
                  The illuminated distance of any given luminaires shall not exceed three times the height of the given luminaire.

                  The intent of this article is to establish minimum development standards and criteria that will afford reasonable protection of environmentally sensitive natural resources found throughout the city. Based on the findings of the Joint Pickens County-Jasper-Nelson-Talking Rock Comprehensive Plan, it has been determined that the wise management of these resources as defined in this article is essential to maintaining the health, safety, general welfare and economic well-being of the public. 
                  (Code 1979, § 40-9.1) 
                  Sec. 94-181. - Establishment. 
                  The city environmental conservation districts shall include the following districts: 
                  (1)  Water supply watershed protection district; 
                  (2)  Wetlands protection district. 
                  The boundaries of these environmental conservation districts are shown on a set of maps designated as "Overlay District" and are included as part of the city's official zoning district map, which is on file with the city clerk for public use. 
                  (Code 1979, § 40-9.2) 
                  Sec. 94-182. - Definitions. 
                  In addition to the definitions provided in section 94-2, the following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Environmental conservation district means an environmental conservation district map overlay that imposes a set of requirements in addition to those of the underlying zoning district. 
                  Hazardous waste means any solid waste which has been defined as a hazardous waste in regulations, promulgated by the administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) pursuant to the federal act, which are in force and effect on February 1, 1988, codified as 40 CFR 261. 
                  Perennial stream means a stream or section of a river/stream that flows continuously throughout the whole year. 
                  Stream bank means the rising ground, bordering a stream, which serves to confine the water to the natural channel during the normal course of flow. 
                  Utility means public or private water or sewer piping systems, water or sewer pumping stations, electric power lines, fuel pipelines, telephone lines, roads, driveways, bridges, river/lake access facilities, stormwater systems and railroads or other utilities identified by a local government. 
                  Wetlands means those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas. The ecological parameters for designating wetlands include hydric soils, hydrological vegetation, and hydrological conditions that involve a temporary or permanent source of water to cause soil saturation.

                  Sec. 94-183. - Water supply watershed protection district. 
                  (a)  Findings of fact. In order to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within the city and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be ensured. The ability of natural systems to filter stormwater runoff can be threatened by unrestricted urban and suburban development. Land disturbing activities associated with development can increase erosion and sedimentation that threatens the storage capacity of reservoirs. In addition, stormwater runoff, particularly from impervious surfaces, can introduce toxicants, nutrients, and sediment into drinking water supplies, making water treatment more complicated and expensive and rendering water resources unusable. Industrial land uses that involve the manufacture, use, transport and storage of hazardous or toxic waste materials result in the potential risk of contamination of nearby public drinking water supplies. 
                  (b)  Purpose. The purpose of the water supply watershed protection district regulations is to establish measures to protect the quality and quantity of the present and future water supply for the city that will minimize the transport of pollutants and sediment to the water supply, and maintain the yield of the water supply watersheds. 
                  (c)  District delineation. Toe protected water supply watershed districts are hereby designated, and shall comprise the land areas that drain to the public water supply intake. The boundaries of these districts are defined by the ridge lines of the respective watersheds and the boundary of a radius seven miles upstream of the respective public water supply intakes. These districts shall be further delineated and denned on the water supply watershed protection district overlay map for the city official zoning district map, which is hereby incorporated and made a part of this chapter by reference. 
                  (d)  Permitted uses. All uses allowed in the underlying zoning districts as established by this chapter except for those listed in subsection (f) of this section are permitted in the water supply watershed protection district, subject to the following standards: 
                  (1)  Natural buffer requirements. 
                  a.  Within a seven-mile radius upstream of the public water intakes, a natural buffer, 100 feet wide shall be maintained on both sides of the stream, measured from the stream banks. Similarly, outside the seven-mile radius, a natural buffer of 50 feet shall be maintained on both sides of the stream. 
                  b.  A natural buffer shall be maintained for a distance of 150 feet from the boundary of any existing or future water supply reservoir. 
                  (2)  Impervious surface limitations. 
                  a.  No more than 25 percent of the land area of any parcel or lot on which new development is placed may be covered by impervious surface within a designated water supply watershed protection district. 
                  b.  Within a seven-mile radius upstream of all public water intakes, no impervious surface shall be constructed within a 150-foot setback area on both sides of the streams as measured from the stream banks. No septic tanks and/or septic tank drainfields shall be located within the 150-foot setback. 
                  c.  Outside a seven-mile radius upstream of all public water intakes, no impervious surface shall be constructed within a 75-foot setback area on both side of the stream, as measured from the stream banks. No septic tanks and/or septic tank drainfields shall be located within the 75-foot setback. 
                  (e)  Exemptions. The following uses are exempt from the stream corridor buffer and setback requirements if they meet the stipulated conditions: 
                  (1)  Utilities. 
                  a.  Utilities shall be located as far as reasonably possible from the stream bank, and shall not impair the quality of the drinking water stream. 
                  b.  Utilities shall be installed and maintained without changing the integrity of the buffer and setback areas as much as possible. 
                  (2)  Forestry and agricultural activities. 
                  a.  Agriculture activities involving the planting and harvesting of crops are exempted if they conform to the best management practices established by the state department of agriculture. 
                  b.  Silviculture activities must conform to the best management practices established by the state forestry commission. 
                  (f)  Prohibited uses. The following are prohibited uses within the water supply watershed protection district: 
                  (1)  All sanitary landfills with or without synthetic liners and leachate collection systems. 
                  (2)  All hazardous-waste manufacture, handling, storage, treatment or disposal facilities, which handle hazardous materials of the types listed in section 312 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (42 USC 6901 et seq.). 
                  (Code 1979, § 40-9.4) 
                  Sec. 94-184. - Wetlands protection district. 
                  (a)  Findings of fact. The wetlands within the city are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion, and soil limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife, and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; open space; and recreational opportunities. 
                  (b)  Purpose. The purpose of this district is co promote the wise use of wetlands and protect them from alterations that will significantly affect or reduce their primary functions for water quality, floodplain and erosion control, groundwater recharge, aesthetic natural areas and wildlife habitat areas. 
                  (c)  District delineation. These regulations shall apply to all lands within wetlands located within the city. The wetland protection district overlay map, adopted as part of this chapter, shows the general location of wetlands and should be consulted by persons contemplating activities in or near wetlands before engaging in a regulated activity. The wetland protection district map is an overlay map of the city's official zoning district map, which is hereby incorporated and made a part of this chapter by reference and shall be on tile with the enforcement officer. 
                  (d)  Wetland development permit requirements. No activity or use except those identified in subsection (e) of this section shall be allowed within the wetland protection district without written permission from the enforcement officer in the form of a local development permit. Issuance of a local development permit is contingent on full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations.

                  Sec. 94-265. - Limitations on continuance. 
                  (a)  Any structure or use of land existing at the time of enact or subsequent amendment of the zoning ordinance from which this chapter is derived, but not in conformity with its use provision may be continued with the following limitations:

                  (2)  A nonconforming use/structure may not be reestablished after discontinuance of use/structure for one year. 
                  (3)  A nonconforming use or structure may not be enlarged beyond its size at the time use or structure becomes nonconforming. This includes, but is not limited to, any of the building/structure, the number of employees, operation during other hours of the day or night, the use of additional land, and additional or more powerful equipment. 
                  (4)  A nonconforming structure may not be rebuilt, altered, repaired or replaced incurring damages exceeding 75 percent of the fair market value of the structure at the time immediately preceding such damage occurring. A nonconforming mobile home/manufactured home may not be replaced after it is removed from the property. 
                  (b)  The city council may grant the change, reestablishment or enlargement of a nonconforming use or the enlargement, rebuilding, alteration, repair or replacement nonconforming structure upon the following findings: 
                  (1)  The change, reestablishment, enlargement, rebuilding, alteration, repair or replacement would be no more detrimental to the surrounding area than the existing or present use; 
                  (2)  The structure cannot be economically modified so as to be suitable for uses in the district; 
                  (3)  The structure would have to be removed to permit development of the proper conforming uses; 
                  (4)  The structure has such value that removal to permit development of the conforming uses would cause economic hardship to the owner; 
                  (5)  The proposed change, reestablishment, enlargement, rebuilding, alteration, replacement or repair would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or purposes and intent of this chapter; and 
                  (6)  The requirements of this chapter for rezoning would prevent the zoning from being changed to a classification that would allow the proposed change reestablishment, enlargement, rebuilding, alteration, repair or replacement. 
                  (c)  Applications submitted to the city council requesting the reestablishment, enlargement, rebuilding, alteration, repair or replacement of a conforming use structure shall include the following information: 
                  (1)  The applicant shall bear the burden of providing conclusive evidence to the council that the use or structure is legally nonconforming. The evidence may include, but is not limited to, business licenses, tax receipts, utility bills, telephone bills documents and affidavits.

This description shall include hours of operation, number of employees, equipment used, products made or sold, type of signs, and information as needed for the city council to reach a decision. 
                  (4)  The applicant shall provide evidence to the city council on how the proposed reestablishment, enlargement, rebuilding, alteration, repair or replacement will conform with the current zoning, health and building requirements. 
                  (d)  If the requested change, reestablishment, enlargement, rebuilding, alteration, or replacement is approved, the city council may place conditions on the approval to ensure protection of the surrounding area. The applicant is responsible for conformance to these conditions.
