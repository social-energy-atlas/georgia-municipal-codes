            <p>PREFACE                   This volume contains the Charter (Part I) and the Code of Ordinances (Part II) of the City of Washington, Georgia. 
                  The Charter 
                  Since the existing Charter will be undergoing revision in 1999, it was not reprinted with the recodification of the Code in 1998. Therefore, certain enhancements to the Code of Ordinances, such as the new page numbering system, will not be implemented for parts of this volume that pertain to the Charter until such time as the Charter is republished in 1999. 
                  The Code of Ordinances 
                  In 1998, pursuant to a legal analysis of the Code of Ordinances, the general and permanent ordinances of the city were completely recodified. 
                  Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1989 Code, as supplemented through April 8, 1996, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the mayor and council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1989 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
                  The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
                  Chapter and Section Numbering System 
                  The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
                  Page Numbering System 
                  The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

                   
                  Indexes 
                  The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
                  Looseleaf Supplements 
                  A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
                  Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
                  Acknowledgments 
                  This publication was under the direct supervision of Milt Lefkoff, Supervising Editor, and Jody Wilson, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
                  The publisher is most grateful to Michael P. Eskew, City Administrator, for his cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that his efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the City of Washington, Georgia, readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

                  RESOLUTION 
                  WHEREAS The Mayor and Council of the City of Washington, Georgia authorized Municipal Code Corporation of Tallahassee, Florida to prepare a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Washington, Georgia in draft form for the thorough review, correction and approval by the Mayor and Council in accordance in Code Section 1-6.

                  NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that the Mayor and Council hereby approve and adopt the Code of Ordinances as revised, corrected and approved by each Council member and the Mayor and reviewed by the City Clerk, City Administrator and City Attorney and adopt the complete Code of Ordinances in its final form as submitted to [Municipal] Code Corporation adding the approved language in the sections indicated and amending the sections indicated and deleting the sections as indicated in accordance with Sections 1-5 and 1-7. 
                  Adopted by unanimous vote of Council at regular monthly meeting on August 10, 1998. 

                   
                  SUPPLEMENT HISTORY TABLE 
                  The table below allows users of this Code to quickly and accurately determine what ordinances have been considered for codification in each supplement. Ordinances that are of a general and permanent nature are codified in the Code Book and are considered "Includes." Ordinances that are not of a general and permanent nature are not codified in the Code Book and are considered "Omits." 
                  By adding to this table with each supplement, users of this Code of Ordinances will be able to gain a more complete picture of the Code's historical evolution.

                  (1)  The city administrator shall receive all complaints of racially discriminatory, insulting or offensive conduct against a contractor or a contractor's employees or agents at any time while under contract with the city for the provision of goods or services. 
                  (2)  Upon receipt of a complaint, the city administrator shall notify the contractor and conduct an investigation into the matter. After an investigation into the complaint, the city administrator shall provide the findings to the city council and mayor. A quorum of the city council, by majority vote, shall determine whether the findings warrant a full hearing into the matter. If so, a hearing shall be scheduled before a quorum of the city council. The parties shall be notified in advance of the hearing's date and time. At the hearing, each party shall have the opportunity to be represented by counsel and to present evidence on their behalf. 
                  (3)  If, at the conclusion of the hearing, the city council determines by majority vote that the conduct alleged was racially discriminatory, insulting or offensive, then the contract shall be deemed to be in material breach of the contract. The city council shall then determine, by majority vote, whether to void the contract. If the contract if voided, the city shall compensate the contractor for all goods and services provided up to the date of the voiding of the contract. 
                  (e)  Required contract language. Effective from the date of adoption of this section [May 14, 2008], all future contracts and requests for proposals involving the provision of goods or services to the city may include the following language: 
                  The City of Washington, Georgia (hereinafter "the City"), has a substantial interest in representing and promoting the values of its residents and providing quality services to its citizens. Racially discriminatory, insulting or offensive conduct does not promote this interest or reflect the values of the City's elected officials, employees or residents. Therefore, any party entering into a contract to provide goods or services for the City (hereinafter "Contractor") shall refrain from engaging in any racially discriminatory, insulting or offensive conduct. If at any time while under contract with the City a contractor or a contractor's employees or agents engage in conduct deemed by the City to be racially discriminatory, insulting or offensive, pursuant to the procedures set forth by ordinance, this conduct shall constitute a material breach making the contract voidable.

The fact that a dog may be owned by a minor child shall be no defense to a parent who is the head of a household. 
                  (c)  A dog not in a vehicle and securely confined therein, when away from the premises where habitually kept, shall be on a leash and under control of a person capable of controlling the dog and protecting others against harm. 
                  (d)  Whenever a dog is being transported in a vehicle, it shall not be taken under the vehicle or allowed to escape therefrom at any place other than where habitually kept, unless on a leash and in control of a capable person, as provided in subsection (c) of this section. 
                  (e)  Any person leading or allowing their leashed dog onto the property of another is guilty of the crime of trespassing, and can be charged in the municipal court of the city for this crime. 
                  (f)  It shall be the responsibility of the dog owner or whoever is in charge of the dog at the time to clean up behind their dog. All litter and feces shall be removed from any public or private property immediately, and deposited in a waste receptacle. Failure to clean up behind the animal can result in a citation for littering.

                  DIVISION 3. - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT 

                  Sec. 18-151. - Purpose. 
                  The purpose of this division is to regulate certain types of businesses, including but not limited to adult dancing establishments and adult entertainment establishments, to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses will be curtailed. However, it is recognized that such regulation cannot de facto approach prohibition. Otherwise, a protected form of expression would vanish. As to adult dancing establishments and adult entertainment establishments, this division represents a balancing of competing interests: reduced criminal activity and protection of the neighborhoods through the regulation of adult dancing establishments versus the protected rights of these establishments and their patrons.

Examples of structural erosion and sediment control practices are riprap, sediment basins, dikes, level spreaders, waterways or outlets, diversions, grade stabilization structures and sediment traps, etc. Such practices can be found in the publication Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia. 
                  Trout streams: All streams or portions of streams within the watershed as designated by the Wildlife Resources Division of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources under the provisions of the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, O.C.G.A. 12-5-20, in the rules and regulations for Water Quality Control, Chapter 391-3-6 at www.gaepd.org. Streams designated as primary trout waters are defined as water supporting a self-sustaining population of rainbow, brown or brook trout. Streams designated as secondary trout waters are those in which there is no evidence of natural trout reproduction, but are capable of supporting trout throughout the year. First order trout waters are streams into which no other streams flow except springs. 
                  Vegetative erosion and sedimentation control measures : Measures for the stabilization of erodible or sediment-producing areas by covering the soil with: 
                  a.  Permanent seeding, sprigging or planting, producing long-term vegetative cover; or 
                  b.  Temporary seeding, producing short-term vegetative cover; or 
                  c.  Sodding, covering areas with a turf of perennial sod-forming grass. 
                  Such measures can be found in the publication Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia. 
                  Watercourse : Any natural or artificial watercourse, stream, river, creek, channel, ditch, canal, conduit, culvert, drain, waterway, gully, ravine, or wash in which water flows either continuously or intermittently and which has a definite channel, bed and banks, and including any area adjacent thereto subject to inundation by reason of overflow or floodwater. 
                  Wetlands : Those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas.

                  (Ord. of 5-9-2011, § III) 
                  Sec. 26-29. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices. 
                  (a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the article and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of this section. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit. 
                  (b)  Minimum requirements/BMPS. 
                  (1)  Best management practices as set forth in subsections (b) and (c) of this section shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of storm water issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. 12-7-6(b). 
                  (2)  A discharge of storm water runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land-disturbing activities occur. 
                  (5)  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsections (c)(15) and (16), in light of O.C.G.A. 12-7-6(c). 
                  (c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regarding and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  (7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. 12-7-1 et seq.; 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection 26-29(b)(2); 
                  (15)  Except as provided in paragraph (16) of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow, Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing; within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped at the discretion of the landowner, purusant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer. 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream, cause of a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines. 
                  (d)  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections 26-29(b) and (c) of this article. 
                  (e)  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
                  (Ord. of 5-9-2011, § IV) 
                  Sec. 26-30. - Application/permit process. 
                  (a)  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, storm water management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this ordinance, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
                  (b)  Application requirements. 
                  (1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the city without first obtaining a permit from the office of the building official to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
                  (2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the office of the building official and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection (c) of this section. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land-disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of subsections 26-29(b) and (c) of this article will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by two copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
                  (3)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to paragraph (5) subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. 12-5-23, provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-8(a) half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the Division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  (4)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by subsection 26-29(c)(15) and (16) has been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per subsection 26-30(b)(6), have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
                  (5)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
                  (6)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  (c)  Plan requirements. 
                  (1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in subsections 26-29(b) and (c) of this article, or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia, is hereby incorporated by reference into this article. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and storm water management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land-disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-20. 
                  (2)  Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
                  (d)  Permits. 
                  (1)  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
                  (2)  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this article, any variances required by subsections 26-29(c)(15) and (16) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per subsection 26-30(b)(6) are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
                  (3)  Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this article, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
                  (4)  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
                  (5)  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this ordinance. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
                  (6)  The LIA may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. 12-7-7(f)(1).

                  Sec. 26-31. - Inspection and enforcement. 
                  (a)  The building official will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article. 
                  (b)  The local issuing authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within 12 months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975. 
                  (c)  The office of the building official shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this article, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities. 
                  (d)  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
                  (e)  The districts or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-8(a). The districts or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The districts or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
                  (f)  The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within 90 days after notification by the division, the division shall revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority.

All such stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop work orders shall apply to all land-disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls. 
                  (c)  Bond forfeiture. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities has failed to comply with the approved plan, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to have forfeited his performance bond, if required to post one under the provisions of subsection 26-30(b)(6). The local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. 
                  (d)  Monetary penalties. Any person who violates any provisions of this article, or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant to this article, or who negligently or intentionally fails or refuses to comply with any final or emergency order of the director issued as provided in this article shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 per day. For the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this article, notwithstanding any provisions in any city charter to the contrary, municipal courts shall be authorized to impose penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Notwithstanding any limitation of law as to penalties which can be assessed for violations of county ordinances, any magistrate court or any other court of competent jurisdiction trying cases brought as violations of this article under county ordinances approved under this article shall be authorized to impose penalties for such violations not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Each day during which violation or failure or refusal to comply continues shall be a separate violation.

                  ARTICLE III. - GROUNDWATER RECHARGE AREA PROTECTION 

                  Sec. 26-35. - Title. 
                  This article shall be known as the groundwater recharge area protection ordinance of the city. 
                  (Ord. of 10-9-00(1)) 
                  Sec. 26-36. - Definitions. 
                  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Aquifer means any stratum (rock layer) or zone of rock beneath the surface of the earth capable of containing or producing water from a well. 
                  Groundwater recharge area (synonymous with aquifer recharge area) means an area of the earth's surface where water infiltrated the ground, thereby replenishing the groundwater supplies within an aquifer. 
                  Pollution susceptibility means the relative vulnerability of groundwater to pollution from chemical spills, leaching of pollutants from dump sites, animal waste from agricultural operations or pollution generated by other human activities. 
                  Pollution susceptibility map(s) means maps prepared by the state department of natural resources (DNR) that show the relative susceptibility of groundwater to pollution. Pollution susceptibility maps categorize the land areas of the state into areas of high, medium and low groundwater pollution potential. 
                  Significant groundwater recharge areas means areas mapped by DNR in Hydrologic Atlas 18 (1989 edition). Mapping of recharge areas is based on outcrop area, lithology (chemical nature and form of the rock), soil type and thickness, slope, density of lithologic contacts, geologic structure, presence of "karst" topography (sinkholes, caves and fissures associated with limestone and other carbonate rocks), and potentiometric surfaces.

                  Functions means the beneficial roles that wetlands serve, including: storage, conveyance and attenuation of floodwater and storm water; protection of water quality and quality and reduction of erosion; habitat for wildlife, including rare, threatened and endangered species; food chain support for a wide variety of wildlife and fisheries; educational, historical and archaeological value protection; and scenic, aesthetic and recreational amenities. 
                  Generalized wetland map means a map showing the general locations of wetlands within the jurisdiction of the city. 
                  Hydric soils means soils that form as a result of saturated soils conditions. A list of these soils is maintained by the Soil Conservation Service. 
                  Hydrophytic vegetation means macrophytic plants tolerant of or dependent on saturated soil conditions. 
                  Jurisdictional determination means an official, written statement or map signed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers or, in the case of coastal marshlands, the state department of natural resources. 
                  Jurisdictional wetland means a wetland area that meets the definitional requirements for wetlands as determined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
                  Regulated activity means any activity which will, or which may reasonably be expected to, result in the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States excepting those activities exempted in section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act. 
                  Temporary emergency permit means a temporary permit that may be issued in certain circumstances specified in section 26-49(c). 
                  Wetland means an area that is inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and under normal circumstances does support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions, commonly known as hydrophytic vegetation.

                  Wetland delineation means the establishment of wetland boundaries by a representative of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers or an authority designated by the Corps. 
                  Wetland protection district all wetlands within the jurisdiction of the city and shown on the generalized wetland map. 
                  (Ord. of 10-9-00(2)) 
                  Sec. 26-48. - Wetland protection district. 
                  (a)  Generally. This article shall apply to all lands within wetlands located within the jurisdiction of the city. The generalized wetland map, adopted as part of this article, shows the general location of wetlands and should be consulted by persons contemplating activities in or near wetlands. The generalized wetland map, together with all explanatory matter thereon and attached thereto, is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this article. The generalized wetland map shall be on file in the office of the city. 
                  (b)  Wetland protection district boundaries. The generalized wetland map is a general reference document, and the wetland boundaries indicated on the map are approximations. The purpose of the generalized wetland map is to alert developers/landowners if they are within proximity to a wetland, which means that there is a high likelihood of the presence of a jurisdictional wetland and a need for the developer/landowner to seek U.S. Army Corps of Engineers guidance as to whether a section 404 permit will be required prior to any activity. The generalized wetland map does not represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the jurisdiction of the city and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this article does not relieve the land owner from federal or state permitting requirements. 
                  (Ord. of 10-9-00(2)) 
                  Sec. 26-49. - Local development permits. 
                  (a)  Local development permit requirements. No regulated activity will be allowed within the wetland protection district without written permission from the city in the form of a local development permit. Issuance of a local development permit is contingent on full compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable regulations. All activities that are not identified in section 26-49(b) below shall be prohibited without prior issuance of a local development permit. If the area proposed for development is located within 200 feet of the wetland protection district boundary, as determined by the building official using the generalized wetland map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required. If the Corps determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site and that a section 404 permit or letter of permission is required, a local development permit will be issued only following issuance of the section 404 permit or letter of permission. 
                  (b)  Permissible uses (uses as of right.) The following uses shall be allowed as of right within a wetland to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law, including laws of trespass, and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining or dredging except as provided herein. 
                  (1)  Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish and other wildlife, provided they do not affect waters of the state or of the United States in such a way that would require an additional 404 permit. 
                  (2)  Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding and canoeing. 
                  (3)  Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the state forestry commission and as specified in section 404 of the Clean Water Act. 
                  (4)  The continued cultivation of agricultural crops. Agricultural activities shall be subject to best management practices approved by the state department of agriculture. 
                  (5)  The pasturing of livestock, provided that riparian wetlands are protected, that soil profiles are not disturbed and that approved agricultural best management practices are followed. 
                  (6)  Education, scientific research and nature trails. 
                  (c)  Temporary emergency permit. A temporary emergency permit can be issued by the city for the following reasons: 
                  (1)  Maintenance or repair of lawfully located roads or structures and of facilities used in the service of the public to provide transportation, electric, gas, water, telephone, telegraph, telecommunication or other services, provided that such roads, structures, or facilities are not materially changed or enlarged and written notice prior to the commencement of work has been given to the city and provided that the work is conducted using best management practices to ensure that flow and circulation patterns and chemical and biological characteristics of the wetland are not impaired and that any adverse effect on the aquatic environment will be minimized. 
                  (2)  Temporary water-level stabilization measures associated with ongoing silvicultural operations. 
                  (3)  Limited ditching, tilling, dredging, excavating or filling done solely for the purpose of maintaining or repairing existing drainage systems necessary for the cultivation of agricultural crops, provided that the maintenance or repair activity does not result in the impairment, alteration or loss of wetlands not previously subject to agricultural and silvicultural use under the terms and provisions of section 26-49(b)(4). 
                  (4)  Limited excavating and filling necessary for the repair and maintenance of piers, walkways, nature trails, observation decks, wildlife management shelters, boathouses or other similar water-related structures, provided that they are built on pilings to allow unobstructed flow of water and preserve the natural contour of the wetland. 
                  (d)  Site plans. Applications for a local development permit within the generalized wetland protection district shall include a site plan, drawn at a scale of one inch equals 100 feet or larger scale, with the following information: 
                  (1)  A map of all planned excavation and fill, including calculations of the volume of cut and fill involved, cross-sectional drawings showing existing and proposed grades. Elevations, horizontal scale and vertical scale must be shown on the cross-sectional drawings. 
                  (2)  A map of any wetland boundaries occurring within the site must be provided. This boundary may be included on other maps provided by the applicant.

                  Sec. 30-9. - User fees for delivery of emergency fire department services. 
                  (a)  Purposes. The Washington Fire Department response activity to motor vehicle accidents and structure fires continues to increase each year and, along with new regulations, places increasing demands and costs on the Washington Fire Department. The Washington Fire Department has investigated different methods for maintaining a high level of quality fire department emergency services throughout times of constantly increasing service demands, and have determined that an effective response by the Washington Fire Department decreases the cost to insurance companies by saving lives and minimizing damage by fire. Raising the real property tax to meet the increase in service demands is inequitable, when many motor vehicular accidents involve individuals not owning property or paying property taxes in the jurisdiction of the Washington Fire Department. The mayor and city council of Washington desire to implement a fair and equitable procedure by which to collect user fees by establishing a billing system in accordance with state and federal laws, regulations and guidelines, for emergency services provided by the Washington Fire Department. 
                  (b)  Motor vehicle accidents. The Washington Fire Department, at the option of the governing authority of the fire department, is hereby authorized to initiate a user fee for the delivery of emergency services, personnel, supplies and equipment to the scene of motor vehicle accidents. The rate of the fee shall be the usual, customary and reasonable costs (UCR) for such emergency services, which include, but are not limited to, any services, personnel, supplies and equipment used by the Washington Fire Department in response to the motor vehicle accident and may fluctuate based on the needs of the accident. The user fee shall be presented to the motor vehicle, commercial or homeowner's insurance carrier of the owner of a vehicle, owner of the property, or party responsible for the accident, and shall represent an add-on-cost of the claim for damages to the vehicle, property and/or injuries to the occupants. 
                  (c)  Structure fires. The Washington Fire Department, at the option of the governing authority of the fire department, is hereby authorized to initiate a user fee for the delivery of emergency services, personnel, supplies and equipment to the scene of structure fires. The rate of the fee shall be the usual, customary and reasonable costs (UCR) for such services, which include, but are not limited to, any services, personnel, supplies and equipment used by the Washington Fire Department in response to the fire and may fluctuate based on the needs of the fire. The user fee shall be presented to the commercial or homeowner's insurance carrier of the owner of the property or party responsible for the fire, and shall represent an add-on-cost of the claim for damages to the property and/or injuries to the occupants. 
                  (d)  Oil and/or hazardous materials. The Washington Fire Department, at the option of the governing authority of the fire department, is hereby authorized to initiate a user fee for the delivery of emergency services, personnel, supplies and equipment to the scene of an incident involving oil and/or hazardous materials. The rate of the user fee shall be the usual, customary and reasonable costs (UCR) for such emergency services, which include, but are not limited to, any services, personnel, supplies and equipment used by the Washington Fire Department in response to an incident involving oil and/or hazardous materials and may fluctuate based on the needs of the incident. The user fee shall be presented to the motor vehicle, commercial or homeowner's insurance carrier of the owner of the property or party responsible for the incident, and shall represent an add-on-cost of the claim for damages to the property and/or injuries to the occupants. 
                  (e)  Authorization. The Washington Fire Department or their designees are hereby authorized to execute any and all documents and/or implement any and all procedures necessary to effectuate the collection of the user fee in order to enhance services by the Washington Fire Department. 
                  (f)  Fees collected. All fees collected per this section shall be placed into the City of Washington General Fund as revenue under the Washington Fire Department account to be used for personnel, supplies and equipment for the Washington Fire Department.

                  Sec. 34-1. - Authorization. 
                  Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and Section 36-1-20(a) of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the mayor and city council of Washington, Georgia, does ordain as follows: 
                  (Ord. of 6-14-10) 
                  Sec. 34-2. - Findings of fact. 
                  (1)  The flood hazard areas of City of Washington, Georgia are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (2)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
                  (Ord. of 6-14-10) 
                  Sec. 34-3. - Statement of purpose. 
                  It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
                  (4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and 
                  (5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters. 
                  (Ord. of 6-14-10) 
                  Sec. 34-4. - Objectives. 
                  The objectives of this chapter are: 
                  (1)  To protect human life and health; 
                  (2)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
                  (3)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas, 
                  (4)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
                  (5)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
                  (6)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; and 
                  (7)  To insure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

                  ARTICLE IV. - PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

                  Sec. 34-61. - General standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure; 
                  (2)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage; 
                  (3)  New construction or substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
                  (4)  Elevated buildings. All new construction or substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater. 
                  (a)  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
                  (i)  Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
                  (ii)  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and, 
                  (iii)  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both direction. 
                  (b)  So as not to violate the "lowest floor" criteria of this chapter, the unfinished or flood resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area, and 
                  (c)  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms.

                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and/or substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and/or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 34-61(4), "elevated buildings". 
                  (a)  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  (2)  Non-residential construction. New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH zones, may be flood-proofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in subsection 34-43(6). 
                  (3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
                  (a)  All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on: (1) individual lots or parcels, (2) in new and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, (3) in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or (4) on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  (b)  Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
                  (i)  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation, or 
                  (ii)  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
                  (c)  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (Ref. subsection 34-61(6) above) 
                  (d)  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
                  (i)  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days. 
                  (ii)  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions), or 
                  (iii)  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "new construction", including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsection 34-62(3)(a)(c), above. 
                  (4)  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 34-22, are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  (a)  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
                  (b)  Only if subsection 34-62(4)(a) above is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of article IV.

                  (1)  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 34-22, then the building official shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of article IV. Only if data are not available from these sources, then the following provisions (2) and (3) shall apply: 
                  (2)  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 20 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in more than a one foot increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
                  (3)  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. (NOTE: Require the lowest floor to be elevated one foot above the estimated base flood elevation in A-Zone areas where a limited detail study has been completed). Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 34-62(4) "elevated buildings". 
                  (a)  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site.

                  Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 34-22, where streams with base flood elevations are provided but no floodways have been designated (zones AE) the following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  No encroachments, including fill material, new structures or substantial improvements shall be located within areas of special flood hazard, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community. The engineering certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles. 
                  (2)  New construction or substantial improvements of buildings shall be elevated or flood-proofed to elevations established in accordance with section 34-62. 
                  (Ord. of 6-14-10)

                  Sec. 34-71. - Variance procedures. 
                  (a)  The board of zoning appeals as established by the City of Washington shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this chapter. 
                  (b)  The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the building official in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. 
                  (c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the board of zoning appeals may appeal such decision to the Superior Court of Wilkes County, as provided in O.C.G.A. 5-4-1. 
                  (d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (g)  In reviewing such requests, the board of zoning appeals shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this chapter. 
                  (Ord. of 6-14-10) 
                  Sec. 34-72. - Conditions for variances. 
                  (1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  (i)  A finding of good and sufficient cause, 
                  (ii)  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  (iii)  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  (2)  The provisions of this chapter are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (4)  The building official shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (5)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this chapter, the board of zoning appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

                  Flood insurance study the official report by the Federal Insurance Administration evaluating flood hazards and containing flood profiles and water surface elevations of the base flood. 
                  Floodplain means any land area susceptible to flooding. 
                  Flood proofing means any combination of structural and non-structural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures, which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents. 
                  Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
                  Freeboard means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of floodplain management. "Freeboard" tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed. 
                  Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, adjacent to the proposed foundation of a building. 
                  Historic structure means any structure that is;

                  2.  Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs. 
                  Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement. An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage, in an area other than a basement, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of other provisions of this Code. 
                  Manufactured home means a building, transportable in one or more sections, built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and similar transportable structures placed on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer and intended to be improved property. 
                  Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
                  Mean sea level means the average height of the sea for all stages of the tide. It is used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain. For purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map are referenced. 
                  National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) as corrected in 1929 is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
                  New construction means, for the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced after May 1, 1987 [the effective date of the initial FIRM] and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced after April 13, 1987 [the effective date of the first floodplain management ordinance adopted by the community] and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
                  New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed after April 13, 1987 [the effective date of the first floodplain management regulations adopted by a community].

                  Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. (Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (NOTE: accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance requirements) for a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
                  Subdivision means the division of a single lot into two or more lots for the purpose of sale or development. 
                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
                  Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the "start of construction" of the improvement. NOTE: The market value of the structure should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
                  For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include (1) those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project, or (2) any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure". 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. 
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations.

                  b.  Set forth the name of the owner of the designated property; 
                  c.  Require that a certificate of appropriateness be obtained from the historic preservation commission prior to any material change in appearance of the designated property; and

                  (3)  Required public hearings. The historic preservation commission and the mayor and council shall hold a public hearing on the proposed ordinance for designation. Notice of the hearing shall be published in at least three consecutive issues in the legal organ of the city, and written notice of the hearing shall be mailed by the historic preservation commission to all owners and occupants of such property. All such notices shall be published or mailed not less than ten nor more than 20 days prior to date set for the public hearing. A letter sent via the United States mail to the last known owner of the property shall constitute legal notification under this article. 
                  (4)  Requirements regarding historic boundaries. Any ordinance designating any property or district as historic shall require that the designated property or district be shown on the official city zoning map and kept as a public record to provide notice of such designation. 
                  (5)  Notification to state. Prior to recommending that the mayor and council designate any property or district as historic, the historic preservation commission must submit a report on the historic, cultural, architectural, or aesthetic significance of each place, district, site, building, structure, or work of art to the division of historic preservation of the department of natural resources; 30 days will be allowed to prepare written comments. 
                  (6)  Decisions. The mayor and council shall make a decision to accept or deny the ordinance for designation within 15 days following the public hearing. 
                  (7)  Notification of adoption of ordinance for designation. Within 30 days immediately following the adoption of the ordinance for designation, the owners and occupants of each designated historic property and the owners and occupants of each building, structure, site or work of art located within a designated historic district shall be given written notice of such designation by the mayor and council. The notice shall apprise the owners and occupants of the necessity of obtaining a certificate of appropriateness prior to undertaking any material change in appearance of the historic property designated or within the historic district. 
                  (8)  Notification of other agencies regarding designation. The historic preservation commission shall notify all necessary agencies within the city of the ordinance for designation, including the local historical organization. 
                  (9)  Moratorium while ordinance pending. If an ordinance for designation (application for an ordinance) is being considered, the historic preservation commission shall have the power to freeze the status of the involved property. 
                  (10)  Authority to amend or rescind designation. The historic preservation commission, with approval of the mayor and council, has the authority to amend and rescind the designation if necessary.

                  Sec. 42-131. - Commission actions. 
                  The historic preservation commission may approve the certificate of appropriateness as proposed, may approve the certificate of appropriateness with any modifications it deems necessary, or may reject it. The commission shall approve the application and issue a certificate of appropriateness if it finds that the proposed material change in the appearance would not have a substantial adverse effect on the aesthetic, historic, or architectural significance and value of the historic property or the historic district. In making this determination, the commission shall consider, in addition to any other pertinent factors, the following criteria for each of the following acts: 
                  (1)  Reconstruction, alteration, new construction or renovation. The commission shall issue certificates of appropriateness for the proposed actions if those actions conform in design, scale, building material, setback and landscaping to the character of the historic district or property. When considering applications for certificates of appropriateness impacting existing buildings, the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Historic Preservation Projects, including the Secretary's Standards for Rehabilitation, as revised as of the date of application for a certificate of appropriateness, shall be used as a criteria for design review along with any other standards or design review guidelines once developed or adopted by the commission for use in reference to specific historic districts or historic properties. Any guidelines not dealing with operating procedures developed by the commission shall receive approval of the mayor and council prior to their being adopted for use by the commission. The historic preservation commission shall provide the city administrator and the building official a current copy of the guidelines at all times. 
                  (2)  Relocation. The historic preservation commission shall have the authority to deny or approve relocation permits within its jurisdiction, through granting or denying a certificate of appropriateness, subject to the normal appeal process to the city council. 
                  (3)  Demolition. A decision by the commission approving or denying a certificate of appropriateness or permit for the demolition of buildings, structures, sites or objects shall be guided by the following: 
                  a.  The historic, scenic or architectural significance of the building or structure. 
                  b.  Whether the building or structure is one of the last remaining examples of its kind. 
                  c.  Whether there are definite plans for reuse of the property if the proposed demolition is carried out, and what the effect of those plans on the character of the surrounding area would be. 
                  d.  Whether reasonable measures can be taken to save the building or structure from collapse. 
                  e.  Whether the building or structure is capable of earning reasonable economic return on its value.

                  Sec. 42-132. - Undue hardship. 
                  When, because of unusual circumstances, the strict application of any section of this article would result in the exceptional practical difficulty or undue hardship upon any owner of a specific property, the historic preservation commission, in passing upon applications for certificates of appropriateness, shall have the power to vary or modify strict adherence to such sections or to interpret the meaning of such sections so as to relieve such difficulty or hardship, provided such variances, modifications or interpretations shall remain in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this article so that the architectural or historical integrity or character of the property shall be conserved and substantial justice done. In granting variances, the commission may impose such reasonable and additional stipulations and conditions as will, in its judgment, best fulfill the purpose of this article. An undue hardship shall not be a situation of the person's own making if: 
                  (1)  It is a problem unique to a specific property. 
                  (2)  In order to comply with this article, the person will conflict with another city ordinance.

                  Sec. 42-133. - Deadline for approval or rejection. 
                  (a)  The historic preservation commission shall approve or reject an application for a certificate of appropriateness within 45 days after the filing thereof by the owner or occupant of an historic property or of a building, structure, site, or object located within an historic district. Evidence of approval shall be by a certificate of appropriateness issued by the commission. Notice of the issuance or denial of a certificate of appropriateness shall be sent by United States mail to the applicant and all other persons who have requested such notice in writing filed with the commission. 
                  (b)  Failure of the historic preservation commission to act within the 45 days shall constitute approval, and no other evidence of approval shall be needed.

                  Sec. 42-134. - Necessary action upon rejection. 
                  (a)  If the historic preservation commission rejects an application for a certificate of appropriateness, it shall state its reasons for doing so and shall transmit a record of such actions and reasons, in writing, to the applicant. The commission may suggest alternative courses of action it thinks proper if it disapproves the application submitted. The applicant, if he so desires, may make modifications to the plans and may resubmit the application at any time after doing so. 
                  (b)  When the application covers a material change in the appearance of a structure that would require the issuance of a building permit, the rejection of the application for a certificate of appropriateness by the historic preservation commission shall be binding upon the building official or other administrative officer charged with issuing building permits and, in such a case, no building permit shall be issued.

                  Sec. 42-135. - Conformance of work. 
                  (a)  Under this division, all work performed pursuant to an issued certificate of appropriateness shall conform to the requirements of such certificate. If work is performed not in accordance with such certificate, the historic preservation commission shall issue a cease and desist order, and all work shall cease. 
                  (b)  The mayor and council or the historic preservation commission shall be authorized to institute any appropriate action or proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent any material change in appearance of a designated historic property or historic district, except those changes made in compliance with this article, or to prevent any illegal act or conduct with respect to such historic property or historic district.

                  The historic preservation commission shall keep a public record of every application for a certificate of appropriateness and of all the commission's proceedings in connection with the application. 
                  (Code 1989, § 9.1-26(l)) 
                  Sec. 42-138. - Appeals. 
                  Any person adversely affected by any determination made by the historic preservation commission relative to the issuance or denial of a certificate of appropriateness may appeal such determination to the mayor and council. Any such appeal must be filed with the mayor and council within 15 days after the issuance of the determination pursuant to section 42-133(a) or, if the commission fails to act, within 15 days of the expiration of the 45-day period allowed for commission action pursuant to section 42-133(b). The city may approve or reject the determination made by the commission or remand with instructions, if the mayor and council find the commission abused its discretion in reaching its decision. An abuse of discretion exists where the record presented to the mayor and council shows that the decision made by the commission was arbitrary, capricious, or clearly unreasonable. Appeals from decisions of the mayor and council may be taken to the superior court of the county in the manner provided by law for appeals from conviction for city or county ordinance violations.

                  Editor's note— An ordinance adopted June 10, 2019, set out provisions intended for use as art. II. To avoid duplicating article numbers and at the editor's discretion, these provisions have been included as art. V. 

                  Sec. 46-101. - Findings and purpose. 
                  It is the responsibility of the city council to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the city. The city council is concerned about the increase in criminal activity engaged in by minors, especially those crimes that occur after hours and/or at times in which juveniles should be at home. A child curfew ordinance is one initiative in protecting our children from being the victims and perpetrators of crime. In an effort to keep our communities drug-free and our streets safe by reducing the numbers of crimes that are committed by and against minors after hours, the city council believes that a child curfew ordinance is in the best interest of the citizens of the city. Accordingly, the city finds and declares that the purpose of this section is to reduce the number of crimes committed by and against juveniles after hours, and to safeguard the welfare of our citizens.

                  Sec. 58-1. - Purpose and scope. 
                  This chapter, "Signs" establishes standards and regulations for the placement of signs which are displayed for public viewing within the city; 
                  Whereas, the mayor and city council find that signs provide an important medium through which individuals may convey a variety of messages. However, left completely unregulated, signs can become a threat to public safety as a traffic hazard and detriment to property values and the city's overall public welfare as an aesthetic nuisance and 
                  Whereas, regulation of the location, size, placement, and certain features of signs is necessary to enable the public to locate goods, services, and facilities in the city without difficulty and confusion, to improve the general attractiveness of the community, to take advantage of the beauty of the community's natural environment, and to protect property values therein. Such regulation is also necessary to facilitate and aid in the identification and location of businesses in the city in the event of police, fire, or other emergencies and to avoid confusion and delay in response to such emergencies.

                  (a)  It shall be unlawful to erect or place any sign which does not conform to the requirements of this chapter. All signs shall be kept in a well-maintained manner from peeling paint, deterioration, etc., and all supports, braces, guys, and anchors shall be kept in constant repair. A sign shall be maintained in a secure and safe condition. If the building official is of the opinion that a sign is not secure, safe, or in a good state of repair, written notice of this fact shall be given to the person responsible for the maintenance of the sign. If the defect is not corrected within the time permitted by the building official, the building official may revoke the sign permit and take possession of the permit until the owner pays the cost of removal, thus placing the sign owner in violation of this chapter and liable for a fine as specified in section 1-8. 
                  (b)  All signs must be constructed in accordance with the adopted edition of the International Building Code, Appendix H, and the adopted edition of the National Electric Code.

                  Any sign existing on April 13, 1998, or at the time of enactment of any subsequent amendment of this chapter, but not in conformity with this chapter, shall be grandfathered in and shall remain in place as long as it is kept in good repair. If the condition of a sign deteriorates and is need of replacement, the new sign must conform to the standards set forth in this chapter. Text changes on billboards do not constitute revocation of the grandfathering permission in this section.

                  Sec. 58-12. - Franchise signs/logos. 
                  Often, franchise agreements require a business to display a franchise sign or national logo. To assist the business owner in meeting his agreement along with installing appropriate signage, the owner may consider the following line of questioning: 
                  (1)  Must the local business buy a sign from franchise? 
                  (2)  Does the franchise offer a sign that fits guidelines? 
                  (3)  If the franchise does not offer a sign that fits the guidelines, can one be produced to satisfy the local business agreement? 
                  (4)  Every attempt to meet the design guidelines should be made to meet the needs of the business owner as well as the overall good design. In extreme cases, variances can be considered for franchise agreements, national logos or established business logos. 
                  (Ord. of 4-13-1998, § 19-180; Ord. of 11-13-2017) 
                  APPENDIX A 
                  Signs are a vital part of any main street. With a sign, you call attention to your business and create an individual image for your store. But it is often forgotten that signs contribute to an overall image to downtown as well. A successful sign can reinforce the image of the downtown as well as serve the needs of the business.

                  1.  Applicants for certificates of appropriateness are required to conform to design guidelines requirements for type of materials, size of signs and lettering, and number of colors to be used. In addition, applicants will be required to limit the variety of typefaces or fonts displayed on signs to the following. 
                  2.  These guidelines do not apply to the applicants' logos. If an applicant has used a logo and does not wish to change the logo to conform to the guidelines, the logo may appear on the sign as it does on the applicant's business card or letterhead. The applicant must furnish the historic preservation commission with a piece of letterhead stationery or a business card for purposes of consideration by the commission. 
                  3.  Architectural features.

                  c.  If there are no photographs available to document a missing historic architectural feature, a simpler design of accurate scale found on building types of the same style and period will be used in the rehabilitation. 
                  d.  Non-historic decorative features and detailing should not be added to the building since they create an inaccurate historic appearance. 
                  e.  When repairing historic features, compatible materials and craftsmanship should be used to prevent additional damage to the architectural detailing. 
                  4.  Signs and awnings. 
                  a.  Preserve, maintain, or restore historic signs and awnings where they originally were located. 
                  b.  New awnings should be traditional and historically accurate for the time period of the building.

                  f.  Signs should be used in a historic location such as storefront bellcourses, flat building sections, and display windows.

They should be compatible with signs on adjacent buildings in terms of size and scale and have lettering in serif, sans serif, or script styles that do not exceed 18 inches in height or 60 percent of the sign area. Like the other components of building restoration, the sign must be accurate for the architectural style and time period of the building. There should be no more than two signs per building (excluding display windows) and no more than one freestanding sign per building front. It is recommended that logos and symbols representative of the business are used since this adds to commercial recognition, and is a historic form of advertising. 
                  i.  Floor, flashing, or internally-lit lighting, as well as lighting that is not easily visible from the pedestrian level, is not recommended. Incandescent spot or up-lit lighting visible from the street level is preferred.

                  Sec. 70-68. - Conformance to city plans. 
                  (a)  Required. All streets and other community facilities referenced or mapped in the city's comprehensive plan, major thoroughfare plan, official map, or other similar official planning document adopted by the mayor and city council shall be platted by the subdivider, or included within the land development plans, consistent with such planning document. 
                  (b)  Reservations. When community facilities other than streets, such as schools or other public building sites, parks, or other land for public uses, are located in whole or in part in a land subdivision; and, are referenced or mapped in the city's comprehensive plan or other official planning document adopted by the mayor and city council; such features community facilities shall be reserved by the developer or subdivider for acquisition by the appropriate public agency. 
                  (c)  Land not required or suitable. Whenever a plat or land development plan proposes the dedication of land or easement to public use that the mayor and council finds not to be required or suitable for such public use, the mayor and council shall refuse to approve the plat.

                  The requirements of this chapter may be modified for a large-scale community or neighborhood unit not subdivided into customary lots, blocks and streets, if the development is approved by the mayor and council and if deed covenants or other legal measures to ensure the completion of the plan are provided. 
                  (Ord. of 11-12-2012, § 1(Exh. A)) 
                  Sec. 70-70. - Conventional street design requirements. 
                  Subdivisions within the City of Washington requiring the construction of new streets shall adhere to the conventional design requirements contained within this section unless such subdivision is partially or entirely located within the boundaries of a character zoning district established in chapter 90 of this Code, or where otherwise excepted within this article. 
                  (1)  Street right-of-way widths. In a subdivision, street right-of-way widths shall be as follows: 
                  a.  Major street widths as shown on the master plan. 
                  b.  Minor streets, not more than two blocks in length, 50 feet. 
                  c.  Dead-end streets, 50 feet. 
                  d.  All other streets, 60 feet. 
                  (2)  Street pavement widths. Street pavement widths shall be as follows: 
                  a.  Major streets as designated in the master plan. 
                  b.  Minor streets not more than two blocks in length and dead-end streets, 28 feet. 
                  c.  All other streets, 36 feet. 
                  (3)  Street grades. Maximum and minimum street grades shall be as follows: 
                  a.  Major streets, not in excess of seven percent. 
                  b.  Minor streets, not more than two blocks long, and dead-end streets and alleys, 15 percent. 
                  c.  All other streets, ten percent. 
                  d.  No street grade shall be less than one-half of one percent. 
                  (4)  Horizontal curvature. The minimum radii of centerline curvature shall be as follows: 
                  a.  Major streets as indicated in the master plan, but in no case less than 800 feet. 
                  b.  Minor streets not more than two blocks long and dead-end streets and alleys, 100 feet. 
                  c.  All other streets, 200 feet. 
                  (5)  Tangents. Between reverse curves, there shall be a tangent having a length not less than the following:

                  a.  Major streets, 20 times. 
                  b.  All other streets and alleys, ten times. 
                  (7)  Curbline radius. The curbline radius at street intersections shall be at least 15 feet. Where the angle of street intersection is less than 90 degrees, a longer radius may be required. 
                  Those design components listed within this section represent the City of Washington's minimum design standards for conventional streets and should not be interpreted by the developer or subdivider as representing all street improvements that may be required of the city within streets and/or street rights-of-way during the review of applicable plans and plats; nor, those additional construction or road section improvement standards which may be adopted by the city independent of this chapter. 
                  (Ord. of 11-12-2012, § 1(Exh. A)) 
                  Sec. 70-71. - Character district street general parameters. 
                  Subdivisions located partially or entirely within a character zoning district as established in chapter 90 of this Code and requiring the construction of a new street shall adhere to the applicable street design standards contained within this section. The mayor and council may also require the application of the character district street design standards contained within this section to streets being constructed or reconstructed within, bordering, or in close proximity to the Washington Historic District as established by chapter 42 of this Code. 
                  (1)  Established. This section establishes the following two character district street types: 
                  a.  AVENUE. 
                  b.  STREET. 
                  (2)  Purpose. Character district streets are designed in a manner that equally accommodates the needs of motorized and non-motorized traffic including pedestrian, bicycle and automobile travelers. Design elements within character district streets provide an aesthetically pleasing gateway to Washington's various districts and neighborhoods, while balancing the standard need to convey persons to a destination with the use of the street right-of-way as a public space intended for multiple activities. 
                  (3)  Relationship to functional classification system. Character district streets are designed to facilitate safe and effective traffic flow and access to property consistent with the Federal Highway Administration's (FHWA) functional classification guidelines. Conversely, character area street design requirements also promote the compact and pedestrian-oriented context of Washington's existing neighborhoods and future planned development patterns. To balance these varied goals, the use of character district street types will relate to applicable FHWA functional classifications for small urban areas and Washington's conventional street types as provided in Figure 70-71-A: 
                  Figure 70-71-A: Character District Street/Functional  Classification (1) Relationship 

                   
                  (1)  As defined by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). 
                  (2)  Per section 70-70 (Conventional Street Design Requirements). 
                  •  Compatible street type. 
                  The conventional street design requirements contained in section 70-70 may be utilized where a character district street type is otherwise required but does not exist to meet the performance requirements of the FHWA's functional classification guidelines as presented in Figure 70-71-A, and as determined by the mayor and council. Where a design specification for a character district street is not provided for a provision related to grade, curvature, tangents, etc., the applicable provisions contained in section 70-70 shall be utilized. 
                  (4)  Specifications. Character district street type design specifications for STREET and AVENUE are located within sections 70-72 and 70-73, respectively. The specifications for each character district street address the following: 
                  a.  Intent. Identifies the purpose and function for which each character district street type is utilized. 
                  b.  Context. Establishes the general criteria under which varying character district street sub-types may be utilized and constructed. 
                  c.  Design components. Establishes the basic dimensional standards for each character district street type and street sub-type. 
                  d.  Streetscape elements. Provides additional information and options regarding the application of the design components to a street segment. 
                  (Ord. of 11-12-2012, § 1(Exh. A)) 
                  Sec. 70-72. - Character district street type (STREET). 
                  The application of STREETs as a component of a land development's character district street system shall be consistent with the provisions within this section. 
                  (1)  Intent. A STREET serves as a walkable low-speed local thoroughfare primarily serving abutting property. A STREET is designed to link residential neighborhoods, and to connect neighborhoods with commercial and other land use districts. STREET design balances vehicular access to abutting property with pedestrian movement and comfort. General STREETs are intended to serve primarily residential areas, but may support limited commercial activity at intersecting AVENUEs or other higher order thoroughfares where vehicular access to the commercial activity does not encourage increased traffic volumes through residential areas. Urban STREETs serve traditional commercial centers and contemporary high-density mixed-use districts, extend limited distances, and emphasize pedestrian comfort. 
                  (2)  STREET by type and context. The type of STREET to be utilized as part of a land development's character district street system shall adhere to the appropriate context and function as provided in figure 70-72-A, and as determined by the mayor and city council. 
                  STREETs as represented in figure 70-72-A shall function in one of the following two manners: 
                  a.  Slow-flow. Narrow travel lanes, parked vehicles and other design specifications serve to limit the speed of motor vehicles to promote orderly traffic flow which is harmonious with surrounding districts and suitable to encourage the use of other modes of transportation. 
                  b.  Yield-flow. Travel lanes are shared between users approaching from opposite directions—Requiring some traffic to stop and yield in the presence of parked vehicles. 
                  (3)  Design. STREETs are subject to the applicable design components provided in figure 70-72-B, and applicable streetscape elements provided in figure 70-72-C. 
                  (4)  Applicability. STREETs to be utilized as a component of a land development's character district street system must conform to the applicable zoning districts established by chapter 90 of City Code. STREETs are eligible street types within the following zoning districts: 
                  a.  Base zoning districts: N/A. 
                  b.  Character zoning districts: CD-1 (Rusher Street Revitalization District). 
                  The mayor and council may also require the use of a STREET type for one or more streets being constructed or reconstructed within, bordering, or in close proximity to the Washington Historic District as established by chapter 42 of this Code. 
                  In selecting the type of character district STREET segment which should be constructed within a land development, the developer must consult with the building official to ensure that their selection is consistent with the parameters of this section and chapter. The mayor and city council reserve the final authority in determining if a proposed STREET adheres to the context and function for which it is to be applied.

                  Sec. 70-73. - Character district street type (AVENUE). 
                  The application of AVENUEs as a component of a land development's character district street system shall be consistent with the provisions within this section. 
                  (1)  Intent. An AVENUE is a walkable low to moderate speed thoroughfare serving abutting property and accommodating local trips by connecting neighborhood streets with a community's primary internal destinations and principal arterial system. Alternatively serving the function of a collector or minor arterial thoroughfare, an AVENUE balances motor vehicle flow with access to adjacent parcels and the needs of non-motorized users. AVENUEs may be located within residential areas but also serve as the primary street type of central business districts, dense mixed use areas and other areas intended to be developed in a traditional manner. AVENUEs also serve as the principal component in the community's on-street bicycle system. 
                  (2)  AVENUE by type and context. The type of AVENUE to be utilized as part of a land development's character district street system shall adhere to the appropriate context and function as provided in figure 70-73-A, and as determined by the mayor and city council. 
                  AVENUEs as represented in figure 70-73-A shall function in one of the following two manners: 
                  a.  Free-flow. Travel lanes for traffic moving in opposite directions are clearly distinguishable and marked allowing for comfortable motor vehicle travel limiting instances where drivers must share space with opposing traffic or parked vehicles. 
                  b.  Slow-flow. Narrow travel lanes, parked vehicles and other design specifications serve to limit the speed of motor vehicles in an effort to promote orderly traffic flow which is harmonious with surrounding districts and suitable to encourage the use of other modes of transportation. 
                  (3)  Design. AVENUEs are subject to the applicable design components provided in figure 70-73-B, and applicable streetscape elements provided in figure 70-73-C. 
                  (4)  Applicability. AVENUEs to be utilized as a component of a land development's character district street system must conform to the applicable zoning districts established by chapter 90 of the City Code. AVENUEs are eligible street types within the following zoning districts: 
                  a.  Base zoning districts: N/A. 
                  b.  Character zoning districts: CD-1 (Rusher Street Revitalization District). 
                  The mayor and council may also require the use of an AVENUE type for one or more streets being constructed or reconstructed within, bordering, or in close proximity to the Washington Historic District as established by chapter 42 of this Code. 
                  In selecting the type of character district AVENUE segment which should be constructed within a land development, the developer must consult with the building official to ensure that their selection is consistent with the parameters of this section and chapter. The mayor and city council reserve the final authority in determining if a proposed AVENUE adheres to the context and function for which it is to be applied.

                  (Ord. of 11-12-2012, § 1(Exh. A)) 
                  Sec. 70-74. - Alleys. 
                  The application of alleys as a component of a land development's street system shall be consistent with the provisions within this section. 
                  (1)  Intent. An alley serves as a low speed and low traffic volume access lane primarily serving abutting property. An alley is designed to provide rear access to properties as well as allow space for services to be located. Alleys are not thoroughfares and should not be utilized as through-ways between two points. They are always intended to function in conjunction with adjacent streets and serve as an origination or termination point of all motor vehicle trips except for a small number of service vehicles. Alleys are required to be used in conjunction with certain character district streets, but are encouraged when any character district street type is being constructed. 
                  (2)  Applicability. Alleys will be utilized as a component of a land development under the following scenarios: 
                  a.  Alleys shall be required by the mayor and city council where subdivision lot widths within a block average 60 feet or less and the parcels front on a major street; except, that alleys shall always be required where such blocks and lots are within or bordering a character zoning district established in chapter 90 of City Code. 
                  b.  Alleys shall be required by the mayor and city council where necessary to meet the design criteria for the construction of a character district street. 
                  c.  Alleys may be required by the mayor and city council in conjunction with a subdivision proposed for property within a character zoning district, or within or bordering the Washington Historic District established by chapter 42 of this Code. 
                  d.  Alleys may be required by the mayor and city council at the rear of multi-purpose or commercial developments. 
                  e.  Where not otherwise listed herein, the mayor and city council may approve the use of an alley in conjunction with any other type of land development so long as it is determined that the alley will serve the applicable intent and context established in this section. 
                  (3)  Alley by type and context. The type of alley to be utilized as part of a land development shall adhere to the appropriate context as provided in figure 70-74-A, and as determined by the mayor and city council. 

                  (4)  Alley design components. The basic design components for each of the three alley types identified in subsection 70-74(c) is provided in figure 70-74-B. Those design components listed within the figure represent the City of Washington's minimum design standards for alleys and should not be interpreted by the developer or subdivider as representing all improvements that may be required of the city within alleys and/or alley rights-of-way during the review of applicable plans and plats; nor, those construction or road section standards which may be adopted by the city independent of this chapter.

                  (Ord. of 11-12-2012, § 1(Exh. A)) 
                  Sec. 70-75. - Street system requirements. 
                  All conventional and character district streets within the City of Washington shall be designed and platted in a manner that compliments the existing street system. New streets shall enhance traffic flow by maximizing interconnectivity within developments, and to adjacent properties and streets; shall respect the context of existing and future planned land uses and development patterns; and, shall promote design characteristics that allow streets to be safely used in a shared manner by motorists, bicyclists and pedestrians. To that end, all streets shall adhere to the street system configuration standards contained in this section. 
                  (1)  Street intersections. Streets shall be aligned to join with planned or existing intersecting streets. 
                  a.  Offset of intersection. Intersections shall be arranged so that planned or existing streets on opposing sides of a road, street or thoroughfare are aligned, unless prohibited by topographic conditions. All other street intersections shall be separated by at least 150 feet, measured from centerline to centerline. The mayor and council may require a greater separation of intersections where the functional classification of intersecting streets necessitates a larger offset. 
                  b.  Angle of intersection. Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles (90 degrees) unless prohibited by topographic conditions; except, that no street intersection be less than 75 degrees. 
                  The provisions of this subsection are illustrated in Figures 70-75-A and 70-75-B. 
                  Figure 70-75-A: Intersection Off-Set 

                  Figure 70-75-B: Angle of Intersection 

                  (2)  Dead-end streets. Streets shall be carried to the property line. Dead-end streets shall not be greater in length than 500 feet, except where topographic or other conditions make a greater length unavoidable. They shall be provided at the closed end with a turnaround having a property line radius of at least 50 feet with an outside pavement radius of at least 40 feet. 
                  (3)  Continuation of streets. 
                  a.  Existing streets. Existing streets and rights-of-way that project to the boundary of a tract being subdivided or otherwise developed shall be continued at the same or greater width; except, where the new subdivision is utilizing character district streets that serve the same function as the street to be extended. In such cases, a transition to the dimensions of the character district street to be utilized may be permitted. 
                  b.  Proposed streets. The arrangement of streets in new subdivisions shall make provision for the continuation of internal streets to existing and adjoining streets unless prohibited by topographic conditions. Internal streets shall also be continued to the property line where adjacent tracts are susceptible to future subdivision. Segments of internal streets lying between the property line and the first internal intersection within the proposed subdivision, and that serve as a continuation of an existing and adjoining character district street, shall be designed to the applicable character district street standard. 
                  The provisions of this subsection are illustrated in figure 70-75-C. 
                  Figure 70-75-C: Continuation of Streets 

                  (4)  Streets for future phases of the tract. Where the plat or land development plan proposes a subdivision or other type of land development on only a portion of a parent tract, a sketch plan of a future street system for that portion not slated for immediate development may be required by the mayor and city council. 
                  (5)  Street names. Street names shall require the approval of the mayor and council. Streets that are obviously in alignment with streets already existing and named shall be given the name of the existing street. Names of new streets shall not duplicate or closely approximate those of existing streets. 
                  (Ord. of 11-12-2012, § 1(Exh. A)) 
                  Sec. 70-76. - Block requirements. 
                  In a subdivision, block lengths and widths shall be as follows: 
                  (1)  Length. Blocks shall be not greater than 1,200 feet or less than 600 feet in length; except where character district streets are being utilized, in which case blocks shall not exceed 800 feet or less than 200 feet in length with an average block length within a development of not more than 600 feet. 
                  (2)  Width. Blocks shall be wide enough to provide two tiers of lots of minimum depth, except where fronting on major streets, limited access highways or railroads, or where other situations make this requirement impracticable. 
                  (3)  Conformance with character zoning districts. Where the dimensional requirements of this section conflict with the standards of a character zoning district as established in chapter 90 of this Code, the character district requirements shall apply. 
                  (Ord. of 11-12-2012, § 1(Exh. A))

                  Sec. 70-78. - Development along major streets, limited access highways or railroad rights-of-way. 
                  Where a land development abuts or contains a major street, a limited access highway or a railroad right-of-way, the mayor and council may require a street approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way at a distance suitable for an appropriate use of the intervening land, a non-access width. Parallel streets may be required by the planting combination of these. 
                  (Ord. of 11-12-2012, § 1(Exh. A)) 
                  Sec. 70-79. - Reserve strips. 
                  Reserve strips controlling access to streets, alleys and public grounds shall not be permitted in a land development unless their control is placed in the hands of the mayor and council, under conditions approved by the mayor and council. 
                  (Ord. of 11-12-2012, § 1(Exh. A)) 
                  Sec. 70-80. - Easements. 
                  (a)  Utility lines. In a land development, easements having a minimum width of ten feet and located along the side or rear lot lines shall be provided as required for utility lines. 
                  (b)  Drainage. Where a land development is traversed by a watercourse, drainage way, channel or stream, there shall be provided a storm sewer or drainage right-of-way of adequate width. Parallel streets may be required by the mayor and council in connection therewith. 
                  (c)  Active transportation facilities. Easements necessary for walkways and multi-use trails shall conform to the applicable provisions of section 70-83. 
                  (Ord. of 11-12-2012, § 1(Exh. A)) 
                  Sec. 70-81. - Improvements. 
                  (a)  Required. Every developer or subdivider shall be required to install or to have installed by the appropriate agency at his expense the following street improvements and utilities:

The mayor and council may, subject to the approval of the appropriate agency, also require that sidewalks be provided by the developer or subdivider along the entire frontage of existing streets which abut a proposed development or subdivision. The mayor and council may also require that sidewalks be provided on both sides of a new street segment where the provision of both sidewalks serves as a continuation of sidewalk segments on an adjoining street segment. 
                  (2)  Location. Sidewalks shall be included in the dedicated non-pavement right-of-way of roads and shall parallel the street pavement as much as possible; provided however, that the mayor and council may permit sidewalks to be designed and constructed so that they meander around permanent obstructions or deviate from a linear path for design purposes. 
                  (3)  Standards, typical. Sidewalks shall be constructed of concrete and be a minimum of five feet wide. A median strip of grassed or landscaped areas shall be provided in residential areas to separate all sidewalks from adjacent curbs. Where possible, median strips shall be at least six feet wide; but, shall in no case be less than two feet in width. 
                  (4)  Standards, central business district. Sidewalks to be constructed within, and in close proximity to, the central business district shall adhere to the provisions of this subsection, except that they shall be a minimum of eight feet in width and may be required to utilize planters and/or grated tree wells in lieu of a planting strip, subject to the approval of the mayor and council. 
                  (b)  Sidewalks, character district streets. Sidewalks shall be provided on all streets subject to the character street design requirements established in sections 70-71, 70-72, and 70-73 and constructed to the standards therein. The mayor and council may, subject to the approval of the appropriate agency, also require that sidewalks be provided by the developer or subdivider along the entire frontage of existing streets which abut a proposed development or subdivision. The mayor and council may also require that sidewalks be provided on both sides of a new street segment where such provision serves as a continuation of sidewalk segments on an adjoining street segment. 
                  (c)  Walkways, required. A developer or subdivider may be required by the mayor and council to provide walkways in the following instances and as illustrated in figure 70-83-A: 
                  (1)  To provide access between streets whenever a block exceeds 1,200 feet in length; 
                  (2)  To provide access to a school, park or other public facility; 
                  (3)  To provide access to a multi-use trail in accordance with subsection 70-83(e);

                  (d)  Walkways, standards. Walkways shall be located within a minimum 20 foot wide right-of-way or public pedestrian access easement and shall adhere to the following standards: 
                  (1)  Walkways to be constructed within a right-of-way shall adhere to the applicable standards for the design of sidewalks set forth within subsection 70-83(a); except, that they shall be a minimum of six feet in width. 
                  (2)  Walkways to be constructed within a public pedestrian access easement shall be a minimum of six feet in width but may be provided with alternative all-weather hard surface materials such as concrete, asphalt or pavers subject to the approval of the mayor and council. 
                  (e)  Walkway access to multi-use trails. Where a greenway, linear park corridor, or multi-use trail corridor identified in the Washington Multi-Use Trails Plan, or subsequent and overriding plans adopted by the mayor and council, is to be located within a land development or subdivision, or on an adjacent parcel, the mayor and council may require the developer or subdivider to provide pedestrian access to the planned or existing trail in the following instances and as illustrated in figure 70-83-B: 
                  (1)  Where the multi-use trail does not yet exist within the corridor, and a funding source for the construction of such trail has not yet been identified, the developer or subdivider may be required to provide the necessary right-of-way or public pedestrian access easement to accommodate a future walkway between the street right-of-way and the multi-use trail easement in accordance with the standards established in subsection 70-83(d). 
                  (2)  Where the multi-use trail exists or has an identified funding source for construction within the corridor, the developer or subdivider may also be required to provide a walkway between the street right-of-way and the multi-use trail in accordance with the standards established in subsection 70-83(d). 
                  (3)  The mayor and council may require additional walkways and/or the necessary walkway right-of-way or public pedestrian access easements connecting street rights-of-way within a subdivision to each other, or to a proposed or existing multi-use trail, where the layout or size of such subdivision or development does not provide sufficient access between the trail and all subdivision lots.

                  Sec. 75-51. - Granting authority. 
                  (a)  No person shall use or occupy the streets to provide any telecommunications services or private telecommunications services or operate a telecommunications system without a franchise or revocable license granted in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.

                  (b)  A person shall not use or occupy the streets to provide any telecommunications services or operate a telecommunications system without a franchise, except that such person may use or occupy specific streets without a franchise if the person obtains a revocable license in accordance with the terms of this chapter. A revocable license is intended to be a limited grant of authority to use and occupy specifically identified streets and: 
                  (1)  May be granted only if the use or occupation of such streets is for the sole purpose of providing private telecommunications services; or

                  In the event an application for a revocable license would cause a person to exceed or fail to comply with the limits specified in this subsection (b), then such person must apply for a franchise in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, and the use of specifically identified streets pursuant to all previously granted revocable licenses shall thereafter be pursuant to and in accordance with any such franchise that may be granted. 
                  (c)  The city council may grant one or more franchises or revocable licenses in accordance with this chapter, provided that the city council reserves the right to modify any provision of this chapter by amendment hereof. 
                  (d)  The grant of any franchise or revocable license shall be made by adoption of a separate ordinance by the city council and shall be on such terms and conditions as may be specified in said separate ordinance and/or a franchise or license agreement between the city and the grantee. 
                  (e)  Any franchise or revocable license granted shall be nonexclusive. The city specifically reserves the right to grant, at any time, such additional franchises or revocable licenses as it deems appropriate, and/or itself engage in the provision of telecommunications services or private telecommunications services. 
                  (f)  A franchise may be granted for all or any defined portion of the city. A revocable license may only be granted for use of specifically identified streets. 
                  (g)  The grant of franchises and revocable licenses to persons providing telecommunications services by the city shall be subject to the provisions of applicable law, such as the provisions in the 1996 Act, as amended, governing telecommunications franchises and renewals thereof.

No application for a new franchise or revocable license shall be considered without payment by the applicant of application fees as provided in this section.

                  Sec. 82-124. - Effluent limits. 
                  (a)  The city reserves the right to assign effluent limits based upon an industrial user's discharge flow. Limitations apply at the point where the industrial waste is discharged to the publicly owned treatment works. All limitations for metallic substances are for total recoverable metals unless indicated otherwise. The city shall develop the limits as necessary and shall effectively enforce such limits. When pollutants contributed by the user result in interference or pass through and such violation is likely to recur, the city shall develop and enforce specific effluent limits for industrial users and all other users, as appropriate, which, together with appropriate changes in the publicly owned treatment works treatment plant facility or operation, are necessary to ensure renewed and continued compliance with the publicly owned treatment work's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit or sludge use or disposal practices. Specific effluent limits shall not be developed and enforced without individual notice to persons or groups who have requested such notice and an opportunity to respond. Effluent limits are as follows: 

                   
                  (b)  The maximum levels listed in this subsection are based on fume toxicity standards. No person or user shall discharge or cause to be discharged any waters, wastewaters, or wastes containing concentrations in excess of the following: 

                   
                  (c)  Users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to comply with this article and shall achieve compliance with all federal categorical standards within the time limitations specified by the federal pretreatment regulations. New sources shall install and have in operating condition and shall start up all pollution control equipment required to meet applicable pretreatment standards before beginning to discharge. Within the shortest feasible time (not to exceed 90 days) new sources must meet all applicable pretreatment standards. 
                  (d)  No industrial user shall ever increase the use of process water or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The city may impose mass limitations on industrial users which are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. 
                  (e)  Where effluent is mixed prior to treatment with wastewaters other than those generated by the regulated process, fixed alternative discharge limits may be derived by the city. These alternative limits shall be applied to the mixed effluent. When deriving alternative categorical limits, the city shall calculate both an alternative daily maximum value using the daily maximum values specified in the appropriate categorical pretreatment standards and an alternative consecutive sampling daily average value using the monthly average values specified in the appropriate categorical pretreatment standards. The industrial user shall comply with the alternative daily maximum and monthly average limits fixed by the city until the city modifies the limits or approves an industrial user modification request. Modification is authorized whenever there is a material or significant change in the values used in the calculation to fix alternative limits for the regulated pollutant. An industrial user must immediately report any such material or significant change to the control authority. Where appropriate, new alternative categorical limits shall be calculated within 30 days. Alternative limits shall be calculated according to 40 CFR 403.6(e)(i).

                  Sec. 82-125. - Effect of federal standards. 
                  Upon the promulgation of the federal categorical pretreatment standards for a particular industrial subcategory, the federal standard, if more stringent than limitations imposed pursuant to this article for sources in that subcategory, shall immediately supersede the limitations imposed under this article. The city shall notify all affected users of the new standard and applicable reporting requirements.

                  Sec. 82-127. - Surcharges. 
                  (a)  Basis for establishing. All persons discharging industrial wastes into the public sewers shall be charged and assessed a surcharge, in addition to any sewer service charges, if these wastes have a concentration greater than the following: 
                  (1)  Water or wastes having a monthly average five-day biochemical oxygen demand in excess of 300 parts per million on a 24-hour composite basis. 
                  (2)  Water or wastes having a monthly average suspended solid content in excess of 300 parts per million on a 24-hour composite basis. 
                  The amount of the surcharge shall reflect the cost incurred by the city in handling the excess BOD and TSS. This surcharge shall include a proportionate share of charges for maintenance and operation of the water pollution control facilities, including depreciation and other incidental expenses. 
                  (b)  Formula determining surcharge. When any or all the BOD and TSS of wastewater or waste accepted for admission to the city's water pollution control facilities exceeds the values of the constituents set forth in subsection (a) of this section, the excess concentrations of any or all, as the case may be, shall be evaluated in terms of these values and shall be subject to a surcharge on the amount derived in accordance with the following formula: 
                  Amount of surcharge = (B + C) × Effluent flow (CCF) 
                  Where: 

                   
                  (c)  Determination of amounts. The rates of surcharge for each of the constituents mentioned in this section shall be determined annually by the city in order that the factors may correctly represent current treatment costs. A schedule of the surcharge shall be on file with the city. 
                  (Ord. of 9-9-1996, art. V, § 7) 
                  Sec. 82-128. - Hazardous discharges. 
                  If any waters or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be discharged to the public sewers which contain the substances or possess the characteristics enumerated in section 82-123, which are prohibited in section 82-124, or which in the judgment of the city may have a deleterious effect upon the sewer works, processes, equipment, or receiving water or which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the city may: 
                  (1)  Reject the waste; 
                  (2)  Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge into the public sewers; and 
                  (3)  Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge through a permit. 
                  (Ord. of 9-9-1996, art. V, § 8) 
                  Sec. 82-129. - Wastewater discharge permit; reports. 
                  (a)  Wastewater discharge permit required, procedures.

                  "I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system, or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment for knowing violations." 
                  (6)  Any person, including the industrial user, may petition the city to reconsider the terms of a wastewater discharge permit within 60 days of its issuance. 
                  a.  Failure to submit a timely petition for review shall be a waiver of the administrative appeal. 
                  b.  In its petition, the appealing party must indicate the wastewater discharge permit provisions objected to, the reason for this objection, and the alternative condition, if any, it seeks to place in the wastewater discharge permit. 
                  c.  The effectiveness of the wastewater discharge permit shall not be stayed pending the appeal. 
                  d.  If the city fails to act within 60 days, a request for reconsideration shall be deemed to be denied. Decisions not to reconsider a wastewater discharge permit or not to modify a wastewater discharge permit shall be considered final administrative action for purposes of judicial review. 
                  e.  Aggrieved parties seeking judicial review of the final administrative wastewater discharge permit decision must do so by filing a complaint with the superior court for the county within three years. 
                  (7)  The city may modify the wastewater discharge permit for good cause, including but not limited to the following:

                  1.  Identify the categorical pretreatment standard applicable to each regulated process. 
                  2.  Submit the results of sampling and analysis identifying the nature and concentration and mass, where required by the standard or by the city, of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process. Instantaneous, daily maximum, and longterm average concentrations or mass, where required, shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of daily operations and shall be analyzed in accordance with procedures set out in section 82-134. 
                  e.  Flow measurements. The industrial user shall submit information showing the measured average daily and maximum daily flow in gallons per day to the publicly owned treatment works from each of the following: 
                  1.  Regulated process stream; and 
                  2.  Other streams as necessary to allow use of the combined waste stream formula of 40 CFR 403.6(e). The city may allow for verifiable estimates of these flows where justified by cost or feasibility considerations. 
                  f.  Certification. A statement, reviewed by the user's authorized representative and certified by a qualified professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, whether additional operation and maintenance (OandM) and additional pretreatment is required to meet the pretreatment standard and requirements. 
                  g.  Compliance schedule. 
                  1.  If additional pretreatment or operation and maintenance will be required to meet the pretreatment standard, the industrial user shall submit the shortest schedule by which the industrial user will provide such additional pretreatment or operation and maintenance. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment standards. 
                  2.  A compliance schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the industrial user to meet the applicable pretreatment standards (e.g., hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts for major components, commencing and completing construction, beginning and conducting routine operations). No increments referred to shall exceed nine months. 
                  3.  The industrial user shall submit a progress report to the city no later than 14 days following each date for compliance, including at a minimum whether or not it complied with the increment of progress, if not the date on which it expects to comply with this increment of progress, the reason for delay, and, if appropriate, the steps being taken by the industrial user to return to the established schedule. In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress reports to the city. 
                  (c)  Ninety-day compliance report. Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards or, for a new source, following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the publicly owned treatment works, any industrial users subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the city a report containing the information described in subsection (b) of this section. For industrial users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR 403.6(c), this report shall contain a production rate. For all other industrial users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharges per unit of production or other measure of operation, this report shall include the industrial user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance reports must be signed and certified. 
                  (d)  Periodic compliance reports. 
                  (1)  Any significant categorical or noncategorical industrial user subject to a pretreatment standard shall, at a frequency determined by the city, but in no case less than twice per year in June and December, submit a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the effluent which are limited by pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified. 
                  (2)  All wastewater samples must be representative of the industrial user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of an industrial user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the industrial user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
                  (3)  If an industrial user subject to the reporting requirements of this section monitors any pollutants more frequently than required by the publicly owned treatment works, using the procedures specified in 40 CFR 136, the result of this monitoring shall be included in the report. 
                  (4)  Any person signing periodic compliance reports submitted pursuant to this subsection shall make the following certification: 
                  "I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system, or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment for knowing violations." 
                  (e)  Notice of significant changes. Each industrial user is required promptly to notify the city in advance of any planned significant changes to the industrial user's operations or system which might significantly alter the nature or volume of its wastewater at least 30 days before the change. 
                  (1)  The city may require the industrial user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application. 
                  (2)  The city may issue a wastewater discharge permit, modify an existing wastewater discharge permit, condition a wastewater discharge permit, or deny a wastewater discharge permit. 
                  (3)  No industrial user shall implement the planned changed conditions covered by this subsection until and unless the city has responded to the industrial user's notice. 
                  (4)  If an existing industrial user governed by the national categorical standards adds or changes a process or operation which may be included in a subcategory, the existing industrial user must make an application for certification prior to commencing discharge from the added or changed processes or operation. A new source must request this certification prior to commencing discharge. 
                  (f)  Reporting potential problems. 
                  (1)  For any discharge, including but not limited to accidental discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch discharge, or a slug load which may cause potential problems for the publicly owned treatment works, including a violation of the city's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit, it is the responsibility of the industrial user to immediately telephone and notify the city of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective action taken by the industrial user. 
                  (2)  Within five days following such discharge, the industrial user shall, unless waived by the city, submit a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the industrial user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the industrial user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the publicly owned treatment works, fish kills, or any other damage to person or property, nor shall such notification relieve the industrial user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this article or applicable state or federal law. 
                  (3)  Failure to notify the city of potential problem discharges shall be deemed a separate violation of this article. 
                  (4)  A notice shall be permanently posted on the industrial user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees of whom to call for a discharge described in subsection (f)(1) of this section. Employers shall ensure that all employees who may cause or suffer such a discharge to occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure. 
                  (g)  Notice of the bypass. 
                  (1)  If an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, the user shall submit written notification to the city at least ten days in advance and receive approval prior to the bypass. 
                  (2)  An industrial user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated bypass to the city within one hour from the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. 
                  (3)  A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain the following: 
                  a.  Cause and description of the bypass. 
                  b.  Exact dates and times of the bypass. 
                  c.  If the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. 
                  (h)  Prohibition of bypass. Bypass is generally prohibited, and the city may take enforcement action against the industrial user for a bypass. The city may approve a bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the city determines the following: 
                  (1)  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; and 
                  (2)  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the cessation of production or operation, operational changes to reduce the impact or duration of the bypass, the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass. 
                  (3)  The industrial user submitted notices as required under subsection (g) of this section. 
                  (i)  Hazardous waste notification. 
                  (1)  Any industrial user shall notify the publicly owned treatment works, the Environmental Protection Agency Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities in writing of any discharge into the publicly owned treatment works of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR 261, the Environmental Protection Agency hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch or other). If the industrial user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the publicly owned treatment works, the notification shall also contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the industrial user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the waste stream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste stream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge commences. Any notifications under this subsection need to be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed discharges must be submitted. The notification requirement in this subsection does not apply to pollutants already reported under the self-monitoring requirements. 
                  (2)  Discharges are exempt from the requirements of subsection (i)(1) of this section during a calendar month in which industrial users discharge no more than 15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes. Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e) requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the industrial user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
                  (3)  For any new regulations under section 3001 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substances as a hazardous waste, the industrial user must notify the publicly owned treatment works, the Environmental Protection Agency Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations. 
                  (4)  For any notification made under this section, the industrial user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
                  This subsection does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this article, a permit issued under this article, or any applicable federal or state law. 
                  (j)  Accidental discharge/slug control plan. The city may require any industrial user to develop and implement an accidental discharge/slug control plan. At least once every two years the city shall evaluate whether each significant industrial user needs such a plan. Any industrial user required to do so shall submit a plan which addresses, at minimum, the following: 
                  (1)  Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch discharges. 
                  (2)  Description of stored chemicals. 
                  (3)  Procedures for immediately notifying the publicly owned treatment works of any accidental or slug discharge. Such notification must also be given for any discharge that would violate section 82-123 regarding discharges prohibited by this article. 
                  (4)  Procedures to prevent adverse impacts from accidental spills or slug discharges. Such procedures must include, but are not limited to, inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants including solvents, and measures and equipment for emergency response. 
                  (k)  Date of submission of reports. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports that are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the U.S. Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern. 
                  (l)  Retention of records. Industrial users subject to the reporting requirements of this article shall retain and make available for inspection and copying all records and information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this article and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring undertaken by the user independent of such requirements. Records shall include the date; the exact place, method, and time of sampling; the name of the person taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or the city or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the city. 
                  (m)  Confidentiality. Information and data on an industrial user obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits and monitoring programs, and from inspections shall be available to the public or other governmental agency without restriction unless the industrial user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city that the release of such information would divulge information, processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the industrial user. When requested by the person furnishing a report and approved by the city, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public but shall be made available upon written request to governmental agencies for uses related to this article, the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit, the state disposal system permit and the pretreatment program; provided, however, that such portions of a report shall be available for use by the state or any state agency in judicial review or enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics will not be recognized as confidential information.

                  When preliminary treatment or flow-equalizing facilities are provided for any waters or wastes pursuant to this article, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operation by the owner at his expense. 
                  (Ord. of 9-9-1996, art. V, § 11) 
                  Sec. 82-132. - Control manhole. 
                  When required by the city, the owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control manhole together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and measurement of the wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessible and safely located and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the city. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at his expense and shall be maintained by the owner so as to be safe and accessible at all times. 
                  (Ord. of 9-9-1996, art. V, § 12) 
                  Sec. 82-133. - Removal, transportation and disposition of scavenger wastes. 
                  (a)  The city may require a permit for the discharge of scavenger wastes after submission of an application on forms supplied by the city. All other materials and substances, chemical or chemical compounds and industrial wastes will not be permitted to be discharged into the public sewer system except as provided in this article. 
                  (b)  The discharge of the wastes in subsection (a) of this section shall be made only at a location in the sewage treatment plant as shall be designated by the city. 
                  (c)  Scavenger wastes will be admitted into the sewer system only by permit and subject to payment of a fee which may be set by the mayor and council from time to time, a schedule of which is available in the office of the city clerk. 
                  (d)  The applicant shall be the owner of the vehicle discharging the wastes. 
                  (e)  Prior to discharging any scavenger wastes, the applicant shall be required to file a statement identifying the exact location of the waste source of each load discharged. Any false, misleading or untruthful statement as to the nature or source of the material shall be cause for rejection of any further discharge from the applicant. Discharges may also be suspended or terminated at any time by the city for the willful, continued or persistent violation of this article. 
                  (f)  All equipment, such as trucks, tanks, pumps, and hoses, used in the collection and transportation of scavenger wastes shall be modern equipment in good repair. When more than one vehicle is used by an applicant, each vehicle shall bear an identifying number. 
                  (g)  Every applicant for a permit shall furnish the following information with each application: 
                  (1)  Name and address of the applicant; 
                  (2)  Volume of scavenger waste for each numbered vehicle; and 
                  (3)  Number of scavenger vehicles in collection service.

                  Sec. 82-134. - Measurements, tests and analyses. 
                  All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of water and waste to which reference is made in this article shall be determined in accordance with 40 CFR 136 and shall be determined at the control manholes provided or upon suitable samples taken at the control manholes. If no special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer at the point where the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewer works and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb and property. The particular analyses involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are obtained from 24-hour composites of all outfalls, whereas pH measurements are determined from periodic grab samples.

                  Sec. 82-162. - Right of entry. 
                  (a)  The city and other duly authorized representatives of the city bearing proper credentials and identification shall be permitted to enter all properties at reasonable times for the purpose of inspection, observation, measurement, sampling and testing in accordance with this article. 
                  (b)  The city shall have the right to enter the facilities of any industrial user to ascertain whether the purpose of this article and any permit or order issued under this article is being met and whether the industrial user is complying with all requirements thereof. The city may randomly sample and analyze the effluent from industrial users and conduct surveillance activities in order to identify, independent of information supplied by industrial users, continuing compliance with pretreatment standards. The city shall inspect and sample all significant industrial users at least once a year. Industrial users shall allow the city or its representative ready access to all parts of the premises for the purpose of inspection, sampling, record examination and copying and performance of any additional duties. 
                  (1)  Where an industrial user has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the industrial user shall make necessary arrangements with its security guard so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the city, state, and Environmental Protection Agency will be permitted to enter without delay, for the purpose of performing their specific responsibilities. 
                  (2)  The city, state, and Environmental Protection Agency shall have the right to set up on the industrial user's property or require installation of such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and metering of the industrial user's operations. 
                  (3)  The city may require the industrial user to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the industrial user at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated on an annual basis to insure their accuracy. 
                  (4)  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the industrial facility to be inspected or sampled shall be promptly removed by the industrial user at the written request of the city and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the industrial user. 
                  (5)  Unreasonable delays in allowing the city access to the industrial user's premises shall be a violation of this article. 
                  (c)  If the city has been refused access to a building, structure or property or any part thereof and if the city has demonstrated probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this article or that there is need to inspect, as part of a routine inspection program of the city designed to verify compliance with this article or any permit or order issued under this article or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, upon application by the city attorney, the municipal court judge shall issue a search and seizure warrant which shall specify what, if anything, may be searched and seized on the property described. Such warrant shall be served at reasonable hours by the city in the company of a uniformed police officer. In an emergency affecting public health and safety, inspection may be made without the issuance of a warrant.

                  Sec. 82-166. - Notice of violation; plan for correction of violation. 
                  Whenever the city finds that any user has violated or is violating this article, a wastewater discharge permit or an order issued under this article or any other pretreatment requirement, the city or its agent may serve upon the user a written notice of violation. Within 30 days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the city. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the city to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation.

                  Sec. 82-170. - Suspension of discharge. 
                  (a)  Under this article, the city may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The city may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the publicly owned treatment works or which presents or may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to the environment. 
                  (b)  Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. If a user fails to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the city shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the publicly owned treatment works, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The city shall allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the city that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings set forth in section 82-171 are initiated against the user. 
                  (c)  A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence to the city, prior to the date of any show cause order of termination hearing under sections 82-165 and 82-171. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section.

                  (3)  Apply the enforcement response plan to the industrial user. Specify corrective action or other responses required of the industrial user, if any. Column three indicates personnel to take each response. The timeframe for each response is listed following the enforcement response guide. 
                  (4)  Follow up with escalated enforcement action if the industrial user's response is not received or violation continues.

                  DIVISION 8. - CD-1 RUSHER STREET REVITALIZATION DISTRICT[8] 

                  Footnotes: 
                  --- (8) --- 
                  Editor's note— An Ord. of May 27, 2009, set out provisions intended for use as §§ 90-636 and 90-637. Inasmuch as §§ 90-636 and 90-637 currently exist in the Code, and at the editor's discretion, these provisions have been included as §§ 90-620 and 90-621. 

                  Sec. 90-620. - General provisions. 
                  (a)  Purpose. The CD-1 Rusher Street revitalization district is a character district established to promote the renovation, rehabilitation and reuse of property in the vicinity of Washington's southwestern gateway. The district provides a design overlay for residential and nonresidential properties that promotes traditional parcel and building arrangements which are pedestrian-friendly and human in scale, fosters a lively mix of uses and generates interaction among neighbors. Building type standards incorporate traditional design elements that accentuate Washington's historic small-town character while allowing flexibility in how such components are applied to individual structures in order to allow for contemporary interpretations of historic building forms. 
                  (b)  Guiding principles. The Rusher Street revitalization district provides the framework to implement the vision established in the Southwest Washington Urban Redevelopment Plan. To effectively implement the redevelopment plan vision, interpretation of the provisions of this division should be such that the following guiding principles are advanced: 
                  (1)  The streetscape will be defined and framed by principal structures rather than parking or open areas. 
                  (2)  As the district develops, building form, arrangement and scale across streets should be complimentary and provide consistent streetscape definition. 
                  (3)  Underlying zoning districts shall be limited to those with uses in which the design provisions of this division can easily be interpreted and implemented. 
                  (4)  Layout and design of public spaces, private property, buildings and structures provides for the architectural compatibility of residential and nonresidential structures with applicable historic districts in Washington. 
                  (5)  New structures will be oriented toward the street and other public spaces, and to the rear of property — in order to provide visual security while subtly providing privacy to adjacent neighbors. 
                  (6)  Openings and entries are oriented to encourage pedestrian activity and direct interaction toward the street space. 
                  (7)  The boundaries of parcels will be defined — whether by building, structure, landscaping fencing or other buffering — but will done so in a manner that promotes visual interconnectivity rather than concealing activity or serving as barriers. 
                  (8)  Areas for vehicle storage and movement — and services and utilities — shall be largely kept from the street space. 
                  (c)  Base zoning districts. The Rusher Street revitalization district promotes the mixture of uses that would typically be found within a neighborhood setting. While the form of development within the district will result in areas which assume a more urban characteristic, the scale of development on individual parcels — particularly nonresidential development — will be limited. Uses that are regional in nature and/or require the compilation of large development tracts, or the construction of expansive buildings, parking or outdoor storage areas are not compatible with the guiding principles of the district. To reduce pressure for the development of property at a scale that is incompatible to the district, only specific underlying base zoning districts may be used in combination with the Rusher Street revitalization district. 
                  (1)  Permitted base zoning districts—Major streets. The base zoning districts identified in Figure V-8-A may be used in conjunction with the Rusher Street revitalization district when the parcel and principal structure face an existing major street as identified in section 70-71, of the Code, or an existing or proposed avenue as identified in section 70-72 of the Code. 

                   
                  (2)  Permitted base zoning districts—Minor streets. The base zoning districts identified in Figure V-8-B may be used in conjunction with the Rusher Street revitalization district when the parcel and principal structure face an existing minor street as identified in section 70-71, of the Code, or an existing or proposed street as identified in section 70-72 of the Code. 

                   
                  (3)  Permitted base zoning districts—Lots with multiple street frontages. The appropriateness of an underlying base zoning district consistent with the provisions of this subsection on a corner or through lot shall be determined by the mayor and city council on a case-by-case basis with due consideration given to the means of vehicular access to the site and the proposed orientation/location of the principal structure. 
                  (d)  Land uses. The base zoning district for each parcel within the Rusher Street revitalization district identifies an applicable list of uses that may be developed by right, or following the review and approval of the planning commission. Within the Rusher Street revitalization district, permitted and conditional land uses identified by the base zoning district shall be classified in one of three manners: 
                  (1)  Land uses prohibited. Land uses listed within Figure V-8-C shall be prohibited in the Rusher Street revitalization district even if typically allowed within the base zoning district. 
                  (2)  Land uses subject to building type standards. Land uses listed within Figure V-8-D shall be permitted by right in the Rusher Street revitalization district subject to the provisions of this division. 
                  (3)  Land uses subject to base zoning district. Land uses not listed in Figure V-8-C or Figure V-8-D shall conform to the requirements of the applicable base zoning district. 

                   

                   
                  (e)  Building type standards. New land uses and structures within the Rusher Street revitalization district will be developed consistent with one of the three building types identified in Figure V-8-D. These applicable building type standards address a range of design and development parameters including parcel arrangement and configuration; massing, scale, and location of buildings on a parcel; and, architectural components that create a uniform character of buildings and structures along the street. Building type standards are located in section 90-637. 
                  (1)  New structures. All uses established in new principal or accessory structures in accordance with the building type standards of this division — regardless of whether they are classified as permitted or conditional within the base zoning district - shall be permitted by right and are not subject to the review and approval of the planning commission. 
                  (2)  Existing structures. Permitted and conditional uses may be established or expanded within principal or accessory structures that are located in the Rusher Street revitalization district and existed before the CD-1 zoning designation was applied. In such instances, the building and structure may not conform to the applicable standards established in this division; and, the building official may require that pertinent building type standards contained within this division be met prior to the issuance of a building permit, use permit or certificate of occupancy. Existing structures and uses may also be subject to the provisions of subsection 90-620(h). 
                  (f)  Character district streets. All new streets within the Rusher Street revitalization district shall be designed and constructed as character district streets as established in section 70-72 of the Code, unless an applicable character district street type does not exist to meet the performance requirements of the Federal Highway Administration's functional classification guidelines. 
                  (g)  Conflicting provisions. Where the application of the character district requirements within this division will conflict or are inconsistent with the application of the requirements of the base zoning district, or with chapter 58 (Signs) of this Code, the character district requirements shall prevail. 
                  (h)  Nonconforming structures and uses. Any building, structure or use of land within the Rusher Street revitalization district which does not comply with or conform to the regulations of this division but complied to the provisions of the base zoning district at the time the building, structure or use of land was established shall be deemed to be a nonconforming use, and shall be subject to the standards contained in division 2, article VI of this chapter; except, that such nonconforming use shall also be subject to the provisions of this subsection. 
                  (1)  Discontinuance of nonconforming uses of land. In some instances, the nonconforming use of land within an existing building or structure in the Rusher Street revitalization district may be discontinued and be replaced by a conforming use of land. In such instances, the building and structure may remain nonconforming with the building type standards contained within this division. In these cases, the building official may require that pertinent building type standards of this division be met prior to the issuance of a building permit, use permit or certificate of occupancy. 
                  (2)  Rezoning of nonconforming uses. The rezoning of parcels within the Rusher Street revitalization district, which contain buildings or structures that do not conform to the provisions of this division, to a more intense base zoning district shall constitute a discontinuance of the nonconforming use and shall require conformance to all of the provisions of this division. 
                  (Ord. of 5-27-2009) 
                  Sec. 90-621. - Building type standards. 
                  (a)  Purpose. All construction within the Rusher Street revitalization district, unless otherwise exempted in subsection 90-636(d)(3), shall adhere to the building type standards contained in this section and accompanying appendices. The standards apply to three specific building types: detached house, multi-unit residential building and neighborhood commercial building. For all three building types, development standards are arranged into the following three categories: 
                  (1)  Building placement and site arrangement. 
                  (2)  Building height, massing and scale. 
                  (3)  Building elements. 
                  The vast majority of applicable building type standards can be found in the following appendices: 
                  (1)  Appendix 90-A.1 (Detached House). 
                  (2)  Appendix 90-A.2 (Multi-Unit Residential Building). 
                  (3)  Appendix 90-A.3 (Neighborhood Commercial Building). 
                  (b)  General principles of building placement and site arrangement. 
                  (1)  In addition to the applicable building type standards contained in Appendix 90-A.1, 90-A.2 and 90-A.3, all three building types shall adhere to the general principles contained in this subsection and illustrated on Figure V-8-E. 
                  a.  Buildings and structures shall be placed within the "buildable area" of a lot or parcel. The buildable area is defined by those portions of a parcel framed by the build-to line and setbacks. 
                  b.  All lots within the CD-1 district shall be subject to a build-to line on lot frontages facing a public street. 
                  c.  All lots within the CD-1 district shall be subject to a setback line on lot frontages facing an adjacent lot line or alley. 
                  d.  No detached house, multi-unit residential building, or neighborhood commercial building shall encroach on that portion of a parcel which lies between the build-to-line or setback line, and the lot line. 
                  e.  Accessory buildings and structures shall be located in the rear yard as established between the rear building line of the principal building and the rear. 

                  f.  Lot arrangement and building placement shall create frontages that frame the street while avoiding unbroken facades that form a monotonous wall. 
                  g.  Required off-street parking shall be provided for all residential and nonresidential uses in accordance with division 3 of article VI of this chapter, except as otherwise provided within this section. 
                  h.  Standards contained within this subsection are referenced in Figure V-8-E. 
                  APPENDIX 90-A.1: CD-1 BUILDING TYPE (DETACHED HOUSE) 
                  Building Placement and Site Arrangement: 
                  Build-to-Line and Setbacks: 
                  a.  The build-to-line for the street facing facade of a detached house shall be 15 feet. 
                  b.  A corner lot's side street build-to-line shall vary depending on the functional classification of the side street as established in chapter 70 of this Code. The side street build-to-line shall be 15 feet along minor streets, or the corresponding character district street type. The side street build-to-line shall be 20 feet along major streets, or the corresponding character district street type. 
                  c.  The minimum rear and side yard setback from corresponding property lines without vehicular access to an alley shall be 5 feet. The minimum rear or side yard setback from corresponding property lines with vehicular access to an alley shall be 15 feet. 
                  d.  Standards contained within this Subsection are referenced on FIGURE A. 

                  Street Facade and Frontages: 
                  a.  A detached house may have articulated facades which include projections of varying depth. While such variation is encouraged, at least 50 percent of the street facing building facade of a detached house shall be located at the build-to-line. 
                  b.  The width of a detached house's front building facade shall span between 50 and 70 percent of the lot width as established at the front building line. Where such a provision is impractical due to the dimensions of a lot existing before the application of the CD-1 district, the location of the proposed detached house and accessory structures on the lot shall allow for the future split or reconfiguration of the remaining balance of the lot in order to accommodate the long-term building placement and site arrangement objectives of the CD-1 district. 
                  c.  The front building facade of a detached house as viewed from the street shall emphasize the vertical dimension, shall not appear excessively wide; and, in no case shall exceed a width to height ratio of 1.5:1. The vertical dimension shall be calculated from the finished ground floor elevation at the build-to-line to a height equivalent with the peak of the roof. The horizontal dimension shall incorporate all structural building components including elements such as porches, bay windows, attached carports, etc. 
                  d.  Standards contained within this subsection are referenced on Figures B and C. 


                  Parking: 
                  a.  Required off-street parking for residential uses may be located within an accessory building used as a garage, an accessory structure such as a carport, an exposed parking pad; and/or, that portion of a driveway aisle located within the buildable area of the lot. 
                  b.  Required off-street parking for nonresidential uses may be located within an accessory building used as a garage, an accessory structure such as a carport, or on an exposed parking pad. On-street parking spaces located on that portion of a character district street directly adjacent to and abutting the frontage of the lot may be counted as meeting the applicable portion of the off-street parking requirement for the nonresidential use. 
                  c.  Parking for nonresidential uses shall be located in the rear yard; except, that a single row of parking extending perpendicular from the street may be located in the side yard behind the front building line. In such instances, the parking spaces shall be bordered by a low wall and/or plantings between three and six feet, sufficient to screen motor vehicle headlights, along the adjacent portion of the build-to-line and side lot line. 
                  d.  Portions of driveway aisles for residential uses between the build-to-line and the street right-of-way shall not exceed 12 feet in width. Portions of driveway aisles for nonresidential uses between street or alley right-of-way shall not exceed 12 feet in width for one-way traffic, or 16 feet in width for two-way traffic. 
                  e.  Where an alley is available, sole or secondary vehicular access to off-street parking via the alley may be required by the building official in lieu of access from the street. Motor vehicle access to a lot from an alley shall be restricted to paved driveway aisles and parking pads. All other portions of a lot adjacent to an alley shall be separated from the alley by a low wall and/or plantings between two and four feet in height. 
                  f.  The standards contained within this Subsection are referenced on Figures D.1 and D.2. 


                  Encroachments: 
                  a.  Encroachments of some building elements are permitted between the build-to-line and street right-of-way. Encroachments within side and rear yard setbacks are limited. 
                  b.  Porches, balconies, stairs, awnings and bay windows are permitted to encroach beyond the build-to-line up to 8 feet. 
                  c.  Overhanging eaves may encroach within the side and rear yard setback. 
                  Building Height, Massing and Scale: 
                  General Principles: 
                  a.  Detached houses shall be measured in stories. 
                  b.  A "story" within a detached house infers a habitable space. 
                  Detached Houses: 
                  a.  Detached houses shall include a crawl space, at least one story and an attic space. 
                  b.  Detached houses shall not exceed 2.5 stories, including habitable attic space. 
                  c.  Slab-on-grade construction of a detached house is not permitted — except for that portion of a detached house that is utilized as an attached garage. The minimum finished ground floor elevation is 30 inches above grade as established at the build-to-line. 
                  d.  The height of each story, excluding habitable attic space, shall be determined by the interior clearance height (floor to ceiling) and floor to floor height between stories. 
                  e.  The ground story height of a detached house shall provide for a floor to ceiling clearance of between nine feet and 12 feet. The maximum floor to floor height shall not exceed 16 feet. 
                  f.  The upper story height of a detached house shall provide for a floor to ceiling clearance of at least eight feet. The maximum floor to floor height shall not exceed 12 feet. 
                  g.  An attic space utilized as a habitable area shall be counted as a half story. The height of an attic space shall be variable depending on roof pitch. 
                  h.  The standards contained within this subsection are referenced on FIGURE E. 

                  Accessory Buildings: 
                  a.  Accessory buildings may utilize slab-on-grade construction. 
                  b.  Accessory buildings may not exceed a maximum height of 20 feet at the eave; however, in no case shall the peak of an accessory building's roof exceed that of the detached house. 
                  c.  Accessory buildings shall not exceed a building footprint of 650 square feet — or 50 percent of the finished habitable first floor area of the detached house - whichever is less. 
                  d.  The standards contained within this subsection are referenced on FIGURE E. 
                  Massing: 
                  a.  Each principal structure shall be designed as part of a larger composition of where it is situated. Adjacent or proximate buildings of similar type which were constructed consistent with the requirements of the CD-1 district shall exhibit a similar scale, height and configuration. 
                  b.  The ratio of height to width on front building facades constructed according to the provisions of the CD-1 district shall be similar. Front building facades which emphasize a horizontal dimension are unacceptable. 
                  Building Elements: 
                  The preferred building elements within this subsection provide minimum architectural standards to be incorporated into the construction of a "detached house" building type within the CD-1 district. The features required by this subsection provide for a coherent character within the district, and building elements which foster personal interaction, while promoting lasting quality and value within the neighborhood. 
                  Building Orientation and Access: 
                  a.  A detached house shall be oriented so that the front building facade faces the street. On corner lots, the orientation of the front building facade shall typically correspond with the narrower street frontage, but shall also be determined based on convenience of vehicular access and the site arrangement of adjacent lots developed consistent with the requirements of the CD-1 district. 
                  b.  The primary pedestrian entrance to a detached house shall be provided on the ground story of the front building facade. The functioning entry door shall face the street. 
                  c.  A minimum three-foot wide paved pedestrian path shall be provided from the primary pedestrian entrance to the sidewalk; or, in lieu of a sidewalk to the driveway aisle. 
                  d.  Where a detached house contains more than one independent leasable space (i.e. duplex, offices, etc.), the primary pedestrian entrance of only one of the units is required to be located on the front building facade. The primary pedestrian entrance of two units may face the street, but only if all other elements of the street facing facade provide the impression of a single-unit detached house. Alternatively, the primary pedestrian entrance may serve as a shared entrance to both units. 
                  e.  In addition to the primary pedestrian entrance located on a detached house's front building facade, at least one more pedestrian entrance shall be located on the rear or side facade for each unit to promote pedestrian flow through the house. The location of the second required pedestrian entrance for nonresidential uses shall correspond to the location of the majority of the use's required off-street parking. 
                  Fenestration: 
                  a.  Fenestration requirements are applicable to street facing building facades and building facades that face any other public or common area. 
                  b.  Fenestration — including doors and windows - shall comprise no less than 25 percent of the ground story facade. Fenestration is measured as the area comprising the opening in the faced. Framing elements with a dimension of greater than one inch are excluded from calculating ground story facade fenestration. 
                  c.  Blank lengths of wall on all habitable stories shall not exceed 15 feet in length as measured between openings. This provision is applicable to gabled habitable attic stories. 

                  d.  Double-hung windows are required on applicable building facades. Casement or sliding type windows are not permitted.

                  In all zoning districts, no discharge at any point into any private sewage disposal system, into the ground, or into any stream of any materials of such nature or temperature as can contaminate any water supply or otherwise create a harmful effect on groundwaters or surface waters shall be permitted, except in accord with city and county health standards or applicable state stream pollution control standards. No garbage, rubbish, or other solid wastes shall be stored outdoors or allowed to accumulate on any lot or in a street or alley adjoining the lot for periods in excess of the regular collection interval of public or contracted waste collection services.

                  Zoning district requirements for building line setbacks from street right-of-way lines may be modified where the majority of the frontage within 200 feet on each side of a lot within the same block and district and fronting on the same street with such lot is developed with less than the required setback. In such cases the required building setback shall be the average of existing setbacks, counting any undeveloped frontage as if it were developed at the required setback distance from the street. This modification shall not apply if such existing development is located within and scheduled for acquisition along any proposed right-of-way of a major street and road improvement included as part of any applicable major street and road plan and public improvement program.

                  In all zoning districts, all structures, shrubs, and outdoor uses in excess of 30 inches in height, except nonvision obstructive structural appurtenances, and of such character as to constitute a permanent, regular, or temporary obstruction to vision shall be set back beyond an intersection setback line, as determined in this section, so as to constitute neither hazard nor nuisance to the general public. For this purpose, an intersection sight triangle is established at each intersection at a grade determined by three points—the point of street intersection and two points at a prescribed distance therefrom measured along the centerline of each leg of the intersection. The leg dimensions for all minor streets shall be 40 feet; for all other streets leg dimensions shall be 60 feet. An open space shall be maintained in each such triangle and no vision-obstructive structures, shrubs, or other use in excess of 30 inches shall be allowed within the limits of the sight triangle. Exceptions shall be made for utility poles, lighting standards, post office boxes, traffic signs, and trees, the branches which are kept trimmed to a height of eight feet aboveground.

                  It is the intent of this division to avoid any unreasonable invasion of established private property rights; however, this chapter recognizes that the elimination, as expeditiously as is reasonable, of existing structures and uses that are not in conformity with this chapter is as much a subject of health, safety, and general welfare as is the prevention of the establishment of new uses which would violate the purpose, intent, and provisions of this chapter. Any lawfully existing nonconforming use of land or structure may be continued and maintained except as otherwise provided in this division.

                  A nonconforming building or structure shall not be added to or enlarged in any manner unless the building or structure, including additions, conforms to the regulations for the zoning district in which it is located. However, if a building or structure is conforming as to use, but nonconforming as to setback, height, or off-street parking requirements, the building may be enlarged or added to, provided that the enlargement or addition complies with all the requirements of the district in which the building is located. No nonconforming structure shall be moved in whole or in part to another location on the lot unless every portion of the building is made to conform to all the requirements of this chapter.

                  When a nonconforming use of any structure or land has been discontinued for a period of one year, it shall not be reestablished or changed to any use not in conformity with this chapter. No nonconforming use shall be changed to another nonconforming use.

                  Any nonconforming building or structure that is devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use and which has been damaged by fire, explosion, act of God, or other causes, to the extent of 75 percent of its fair market value, shall not be repaired or reconstructed except where such building or structure and the use thereof shall conform to all of the regulations of the zoning district in which it is located. When such damage equates to less than 75 percent of fair market value, no repairs or reconstruction shall be made unless authority is granted in conformity with this chapter and all other applicable sections of Washington City Code, and repairs are begun within one year after the date of such damage and are diligently pursued to completion.

                  The right to continue a nonconforming use is conditional and may be continued for only so long as the nonconforming activity is conducted lawfully and does not produce a condition which constitutes a nuisance. The use of any building, structure or land in a manner set forth within this section shall constitute abandonment of the nonconforming use, shall equate to immediate termination of the nonconforming use, and nothing contained in section 90-678 shall be construed to require such a condition to continue for a period of one year. Actions constituting abandonment and immediate termination of a nonconforming use shall include: 
                  (1)  Use in a manner which produces a condition constituting any type of nuisance established in chapters 38 or 46 of the Washington City Code.

Such sign shall be not less than nine square feet in area with not less than two-inch black letters upon a white background stating the required information. 
                  (4)  At least 15 days but not more than 45 days prior to the scheduled public hearing, the city clerk shall advertise such hearing in a newspaper of general circulation in the city and shall notify all property owners within 400 feet of the subject property by mail. 
                  (5)  Prior to the public hearing the planning commission shall prepare an assessment and recommendation on the proposal using the following criteria, and shall advise the mayor and council of its findings: 
                  a.  Existing uses and zoning of nearby property. 
                  b.  The extent to which property values are diminished by the particular zoning restrictions. 
                  c.  The extent to which the destruction of property values of the plaintiff promotes the health, safety, morals, or general welfare of the public. 
                  d.  The relative gain to the public, as compared to the hardship imposed upon the individual property owner. 
                  e.  The suitability of the subject property for the zoned purposes. 
                  f.  The length of time the property has been vacant as zoned considered in the context of land development in the area in the vicinity of the property. 
                  g.  Conformity with or divergence from the land use plan. 
                  (6)  Copies of the draft, zoning ordinance and map, plus the evaluation of the proposed district boundary changes, will be made available for public review during normal working hours between the date of the appearance of the public hearing notice and the time of the public hearing. 
                  (7)  The public hearing shall be conducted by the mayor and council. 
                  (8)  The mayor and council will review for those present procedures and set forth the operating procedures for the hearing as follows: 
                  a.  In order for a person in attendance to speak, the chair must recognize the person. Upon rising to speak, the person recognized will first identify himself. The chair may also request that the person furnish a home or business street address, as appropriate. 
                  b.  The person speaking will be allowed a reasonable time to express opinions and make points on each separate element of the proposed revisions which the person wishes to address, with a maximum total of ten minutes allowed per person.

                  (b)  Upon receipt of an application and payment of the variance fee, as prescribed from time to time by the mayor and council and filed in the office of the city administrator, with the city administrator, the board of zoning appeals shall hold a public hearing, after having first given public notice thereof in a newspaper of general circulation in the city 15 days prior to the date of the hearing, and will notify all property owners within 400 feet of the property in question by mail of the variance request.

                  (c)  Variances from the terms of this chapter may be granted in such individual hardship cases of practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship upon a finding by the board of zoning appeals based on the following criteria:

                  (3)  For reasons fully set forth in the findings of the board, the special circumstances or conditions are such that the strict application of this chapter would deprive the applicant of any reasonable use of his land. Mere loss in value shall not justify a variance. There must be deprivation of beneficial use of land. 
                  (4)  The granting of any variance shall be in harmony with the general purposes and intent of this chapter and shall not be injurious to the neighborhood, detrimental to the public welfare, or in conflict with the comprehensive plan for development. 
                  (5)  In reviewing an application for a variance, the burden of showing that the variance should be granted shall be upon the person applying therefor.
