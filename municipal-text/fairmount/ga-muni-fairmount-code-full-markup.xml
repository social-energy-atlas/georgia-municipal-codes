         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE                  This Code constitutes a codification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Fairmount, Georgia.
                  Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances adopted and provided by the City Council. The
                  source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note
                  indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code.
                  5/9/2019 Fairmount, GA Code of Ordinances
                  2/224
                  The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each
                  chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant
                  state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at
                  the back of this Code.
                  Chapter and Section Numbering System
                  The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government
                  codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number,
                  and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is
                  numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the
                  same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new
                  material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new
                  section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may
                  be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article
                  embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be
                  included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is
                  maintained when including new chapters.
                  Page Numbering System
                  The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which
                  represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that
                  portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case
                  of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are
                  typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

                  Indexes
                  The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings,
                  some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local
                  government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as
                  guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested.
                  Looseleaf Supplements
                  A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this
                  system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page
                  or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the
                  manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages.
                  Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are
                  received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached
                  instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to
                  avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.
                  Acknowledgments
                  This publication was under the direct supervision of Michael E. Raabe, Code Attorney, and Colleen Dalton, Editor, of the
                  Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their
                  sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project.
                  The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Aimee Abernathy, City Clerk, and Mr. William R. Thompson, City Attorney, for their
                  cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the
                  publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the City readily accessible to all citizens and
                  which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the City's affairs.

                  Editor's noteâ Printed herein is the Charter of the city, as adopted by 1975 Ga. Laws (Act No. 125), page 3136. Amendments to
                  the Charter are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates
                  that the provision remains unchanged from the original act. Obvious misspellings have been corrected without notation. For
                  stylistic purposes, a uniform system of headings, catchlines and citations to state statutes has been used. The title, enactment,
                  severability, repealer, transitional, ratification, publication and effective date provisions have been omitted, and where a section
                  has been amended or repealed by a later provision, only the current language has been printed. Additions made for clarity are
                  indicated by brackets.
                  ARTICLE I. - CREATION, INCORPORATION, POWERS

                  appropriate entries upon or additions to such maps or description. Such entries or additions shall be made by and

                  Mayor, shall be admitted in evidence in all courts and shall have the force and effect as with the original map or
                  description.
                  The City Council may provide for the redrawing of any such map. A redrawn map shall supersede for all purposes
                  the earlier map or maps which it is designated to replace.

                  this section if the emergency still exists. An emergency ordinance may also be repealed by adoption of a repealing ordinance in
                  the same manner specified in this section for adoption of emergency ordinances.

                  punishment shall not exceed $100.00 or three days in jail. The municipal court may fix punishment for offenses
                  within its jurisdiction not exceeding a fine of a reasonable amount or imprisonment for 30 days or both, and as an
                  alternative to fine or imprisonment, to sentence any offender upon conviction to labor in a city work gang on the
                  streets, sidewalks, squares, or other public works for a period not exceeding 30 days."
                  The Mayor's Court shall have authority to establish a schedule of fees to defray the cost of operation and shall be

                  cash so deposited shall be on order of the Judge declared forfeited to the City of Fairmount, or the property so
                  deposited shall have a lien against it for the value forfeited, which lien shall be enforceable in the same manner
                  and to the same extent as a lien for City property taxes.

                  probable causes that a State law has been violated.
                  The Mayor's Court shall have the authority to administer the oaths and to perform all other acts necessary or
                  proper to the conduct of said court.

                  issuance of summons, subpoena and warrants which may be served and executed by any officer as authorized by
                  this Charter or by State law.

                  Georgia law governing sales and transfers of tax fi. fas. Provided that, upon levy of execution and sale of property pursuant to
                  such tax fi. fas., whether assigned, transferred, or executed by the City, the owner of such property, in fee simple or lesser
                  interest, shall not lose his right to redeem the property in accord with the requirements of redemption of property sold under
                  State or county ad valorem tax fi. fas., as said requirements now exist or as may hereinafter be provided by law.

                  as it shall deem equitable and just for the City.
                  The Council may quitclaim any rights it may have in property not needed for public purposes upon report by the
                  Mayor and adoption of a resolution, both finding that the property is not needed for public or other purposes and
                  that the interest of the City has no readily ascertainable monetary value.
                  Whenever in opening, extending or widening any street, avenue, alley, or public place of the City, a small parcel or
                  tract of land is cut off or separated by such work from a larger tract or boundary of land owned by the City, the
                  Council may authorize the Mayor to execute and deliver in the name of the City a deed conveying said cut-off or
                  separated parcel or tract of land to an abutting or adjoining property owner or owners in exchange for rights-ofway of said street, avenue, alley, or public place or in settlement of any alleged damages sustained by said abutting
                  or adjoining property owner. All deeds and conveyances heretofore and hereafter so executed and delivered shall
                  convey all title and interest the City has in such property, notwithstanding the fact that no public sale after
                  advertisement was or is hereafter made.

                  The provisions appearing in this Code, so far as they are the same as ordinances adopted prior to this Code and included in
                  such Code, shall be considered as continuations and not as new enactments.
                  Sec. 1-8. - Amendments to Code.
                  All ordinances passed subsequent to this Code that amend, repeal or in any way affect this Code may be
                  numbered in accordance with the numbering system of this Code and printed for inclusion in this Code. In the case
                  of repealed chapters, sections and subsections or any part of such chapters, sections and subsections, by
                  subsequent ordinances, such repealed portions may be excluded from the Code by omission from reprinted
                  pages. The subsequent ordinances as numbered and printed or omitted, in the case of repeal, shall be prima facie
                  evidence of such subsequent ordinances until such time that this Code and subsequent ordinances numbered or
                  omitted are readopted as a new code by the city council.
                  Amendments to any of the provisions of this Code may be made by amending such provisions by specific reference
                  to the section number of this Code.
                  If a new section not heretofore existing in the Code is to be added, the following language may be used: "That The
                  Code of the City of Fairmount, Georgia, is hereby amended by adding a section (or article or chapter) to be
                  numbered, which section reads as follows: â¦ ." The new section may then be set out in full as desired.
                  All sections, articles, chapters or provisions desired to be repealed should be specifically repealed by section,
                  article or chapter number, as the case may be.
                  Sec. 1-9. - Supplementation of Code.
                  By contract or by city personnel, supplements to this Code shall be prepared at least on an annual basis. A
                  supplement to the Code shall include all substantive, permanent and general parts of ordinances passed by the
                  city council during the period covered by the supplement and all changes made by the supplement in the Code.
                  The pages of a supplement shall be so numbered that they will fit properly into the Code and will, where necessary,

                  they have been inserted, the Code will be current through the date of the adoption of the latest ordinance included
                  in the supplement.
                  In preparing a supplement to this Code, all portions of the Code that have been repealed shall be excluded from
                  the Code by their omission from reprinted pages.
                  When preparing a supplement to this Code, the codifier (meaning the person authorized to prepare the
                  supplement) may make formal, nonsubstantive changes in ordinances and parts of ordinances included in the
                  supplement, insofar as it is necessary to do so to embody them into a unified code. For example, the codifier may:
                  Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions.
                  Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in
                  the supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles.
                  Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the Code and, where
                  necessary to accommodate new material, change existing section or other subdivision numbers.
                  Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this
                  division," etc., as the case may be, or to "sections ____________ ____________to ____________ ____________"
                  (inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code that embody the substantive sections of the
                  ordinance incorporated into the Code).
                  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meanings of ordinance sections
                  inserted into the Code; but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of
                  ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code.
                  Sec. 1-10. - Altering Code.
                  It shall be unlawful for any person in the city to change or amend by additions or deletions any part or portion of this Code, or
                  to insert or delete pages, or portions of pages, or to alter or tamper with such Code in any manner whatsoever which will cause
                  the law of the city to be misrepresented, unless so authorized by ordinance or resolution or other official act of the city council.
                  Any person violating this section shall be punished as provided in section 1-11.

                  Whenever in this Code or in any ordinance of the city any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or
                  an offense, or whenever in this Code or any ordinance the doing of any act is required and the failure to do such
                  act is declared to be unlawful, and no specific penalty is provided, and unless otherwise provided by state law, the
                  violation of any such provision of this Code or any such ordinance shall be punished by a fine not to exceed
                  $1,000.00 and imprisonment in the city or county jail and work and labor on the streets or public works of the city,
                  whether within or without the corporate limits, not exceeding 30 days, or both a fine and sentence of
                  imprisonment and labor; and all sentences may be in the alternative and fines may be imposed with the alternative
                  of sentence to imprisonment and labor if the fines are not paid. Each day any violation of this Code or of any
                  ordinance shall continue shall constitute a separate offense.
                  Violations of this Code may be abated by injunctive or other equitable relief. The imposition of a penalty does not
                  prevent injunctive relief.
                  The judge of the municipal court shall have the power and authority to:
                  Impose upon persons convicted in the municipal court the fines provided for in this Code, the ordinances of
                  the city, or as otherwise provided by law, with the alternative of other punishment allowed by law, if such

                  Records as published by the Georgia Secretary of State's Department of Archives and History, and any such
                  amendments or updates as may be made to such Retention Schedule for Local Government Records.
                  All city records shall be maintained in accordance with approved retention schedules, in the most updated version
                  of the Retention Schedule for Local Government Records.
                  The city clerk shall serve as the coordinator of the records management plan and is authorized to act for and on
                  behalf of the city in directing and coordinating all records management matters under the Georgia Records

                  Whenever any records are destroyed, a certificate of destruction shall be prepared and forwarded to the mayor
                  and council, which shall show the type of records destroyed, the dates covered, and the volume destroyed. These

                  After the commencement of the term of the mayor elected at the next regular election, the rate of compensation for the
                  mayor shall be $25.00 per hour. The conditions for such compensation are as follows:
                  That the mayor, in addition to those duties described in section 2.18 of the city's Charter, perform other
                  duties as may be required by the city council and in such a time allowed by the city council or this Code.
                  That the minimum compensated time allowed for the mayor to perform his duties should be six hours per
                  week.
                  That the maximum compensated time allowed for the mayor to perform his duties should be 40 hours per
                  week.
                  That all compensated time allowed must first be considered and included in the city's annual budget and the
                  budget has been approved by the city council in the usual procedure.
                  That upon the discretion and a majority vote, the council at any time may raise or lower the compensated
                  time allowed for the mayor.
                  That the rate of compensation, if increased, shall constitute a pay increase, and shall require an amendment
                  to this Code. If amended and increased, the effective date shall not be until after the commencement of the
                  term of mayor or prospective councilmember at the next regular election.

                  insurance, retirement, sick leave, and vacation, as set forth in the city's employee benefit policy.
                  That if the mayor's allowed compensated time should be reduced below 30 hours by a majority vote of the
                  council or during the annual budget process then the mayor would not be eligible for health insurance or
                  other benefits under the city's benefit policy.
                  That in the case of a tie vote, when the subject of the vote is concerning the mayor's compensation, the
                  mayor shall not vote, therefore requiring three votes in the affirmative for any motion to carry.
                  That the city clerk be directed to pay the mayor at a time and in the same manner as other employees or in a
                  manner prescribed by the city council.

                  such tax or any installment thereof becomes delinquent. The execution shall be levied by the city clerk or its duly designated
                  officer of the city upon the property of defendant located in said jurisdiction, and sufficient property shall be advertised and sold
                  to pay the amount of said execution, with interest and costs. All other proceedings in relation thereto shall be had as is provided
                  by ordinances and charter of said city and the laws of the state, and the defendant in said execution shall have rights of defense,
                  by affidavit of illegality and otherwise, which are provided by the applicable laws in regard to tax executions, provided by the
                  applicable laws in regard to tax executions. When a nulla bona entry has been entered by proper authority upon an execution
                  issued by the city clerk against any person defaulting on the occupation tax, the person against whom the entry was made shall
                  not be allowed or entitled to have or collect any fees or charges whatsoever for services rendered after the entry of the nulla
                  bona. If, at any time after the execution issued pays the tax in full, together with all interest and costs accrued on the tax, the
                  person may collect any fees and charges due him as though he had never defaulted in the payment of taxes.

                  shall be construed to deny the right of the city to assess and collect any of the taxes or other charges prescribed. Such
                  amendment may increase or lower the amounts and tax rates of any occupation and may change the classification thereof. The
                  payment of any occupation tax provided for shall not be construed as prohibiting the levy or collection by the jurisdiction of
                  additional occupation taxes upon the same person, property or business.

                  may seem necessary, to determine whether the registration held is the proper one for the business sought to be transacted

                  DIVISION 5. - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT ESTABLISHMENTS
                  FOOTNOTE(S):
                  Editor's noteâ An ordinance adopted January 1, 2010, set out provisions intended for use as Â§Â§ 10-31â10-44. Inasmuch as
                  there were already provisions so designated, these provisions have been included as Div. 5, Â§Â§ 10-138â10-151, at the discretion
                  of the editor.
                  Sec. 10-138. - Findings; public purpose.
                  Based on the experiences of other municipalities and local governments, and on the experiences of the city, which
                  experiences we believe are relevant to the problem faced by the city, we take note of the conditions and
                  occurrences generally associated with adult entertainment establishments, whether or not alcoholic beverages are
                  served, result in an increase in criminal behavior and create undesirable community conditions. An increase in
                  instances of disorderly conduct, public drunkenness, prostitution, drug trafficking and loitering of individuals with
                  criminal histories has been the experience of other municipalities and local governments which permit adult
                  establishments, regardless of the serving of alcoholic beverages.
                  An increase in instances of disorderly conduct, public drunkenness, public indecency, public solicitation, violent
                  crime, prostitution, exploitation of young women, drug use, drug trafficking and loitering and loitering of
                  individuals with criminal histories has been the experience of other municipalities and local governments that
                  permit adult entertainment establishments, particular where there are two or more businesses in close proximity,
                  and particularly in such business that serve alcohol. The mayor and council have a substantial interest in guarding
                  against these undesirable secondary effects, to protect the public health, safety and welfare and to preserve and
                  protect the quality of life of the city. The mayor and council also wish to guard against public indecency which is a
                  crime per O.C.G.A. Â§ 16-6-8, and to guard against certain sexual contact provided for money, which is a crime per
                  O.C.G.A. Â§ 16-6-16.
                  The mayor and council also find that the increase in criminal behavior which accompanies adult entertainment
                  establishments causes undesirable community conditions, particularly where there are two or more such
                  businesses in close proximity, and particularly in such businesses that serve alcohol. Conditions experienced in
                  other municipalities and local governments are: depression of property values in neighborhoods surrounding the
                  adult entertainment establishment, neighborhood blight, an increased burden on and expenditure for law
                  enforcement and an increase in the criminal case load in the judicial system due to a greater number of arrests
                  because of the above-mentioned crime problems. The mayor and council note a substantial governmental interest
                  in regulating this and any atmosphere conducive to violence, sexual harassment, public intoxication, prostitution,
                  spread of sexually transmitted diseases and other negative effects. The mayor and council wish to protect against
                  neighborhood blight and downgrade of surrounding neighborhoods due to the problems and undesirable
                  behavior associated with adult entertainment establishments.
                  The mayor and council find that the above-stated undesirable secondary effects will harm the city unless these

                  (3)
                  (4)
                  regulations are imposed to limit such adverse affects. These regulations are to minimize the adverse effects in
                  order to preserve quality of life and to protect the public health, safety, welfare and morals and to maintain the
                  integrity of this community, especially in residential areas, and areas which have a church, school, daycare center,
                  governmental building, library, civil center, public park or playground. These regulations are to promote these
                  legitimate public and governmental interests in a way that will not infringe upon the constitutional right of freedom
                  of expression. The mayor and council are not attempting to preclude adult entertainment; rather, we seek to
                  regulate adult entertainment establishments to protect the public from the above-described, negative secondary
                  effects. The mayor and council has narrowly tailored these regulations to combat the negative secondary effects
                  and protect the public health, safety and welfare, while allowing reasonable avenues of protected first amendment
                  communication. The mayor and council have found no less restrictive alternative to these regulations that would
                  adequately protect the public health, safety and welfare. The restrictions posed by these regulations are no greater
                  than is essential to the furtherance of the government interest stated above.
                  Therefore, the purpose of this division is to regulate adult entertainment establishments to prevent increases in
                  criminal activity and undesirable community conditions. It is recognized that such regulation cannot approach
                  prohibition, or a protected form of expression would vanish. Therefore, this division represents an attempt to
                  balance the competing interests or reduced criminal activity and neighborhood protection versus the rights of
                  adult entertainment establishments and patrons.

                  Sec. 14-21. - Exemptions.
                  This article shall apply to any land-disturbing activity undertaken by any person on any land except for the following:
                  Surface mining, as the same is defined in O.C.G.A. Â§ 12-4-72, the Georgia Surface Mining Act of 1968.
                  Granite quarrying and land clearing for such quarrying;
                  Such minor land-disturbing activities as home gardens and individual home landscaping, repairs,
                  maintenance work, fences, and other related activities which result in minor soil erosion;
                  The construction of single-family residences, when such construction disturbs less than one acre and is not a
                  part of a larger common plan of development or sale with a planned disturbance of equal to or greater than
                  one acre and not otherwise exempted under this subsection; provided, however, that construction of any
                  such residence shall conform to the minimum requirements as set forth in O.C.G.A. Â§ 12-7-6 and this
                  subsection. For single-family residence construction covered by the provisions of this subsection, there shall
                  be a buffer zone between the residence and any state waters classified as trout streams pursuant to Article 2
                  of Chapter 5 of the Georgia Water Quality Control Act. In any such buffer zone, no land-disturbing activity
                  shall be constructed between the residence and the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal
                  stream flow or wave action from the banks of the trout waters. For primary trout waters, the buffer zone shall
                  be at least 50 horizontal feet, and no variance to a smaller buffer shall be granted. For secondary trout
                  waters, the buffer zone shall be at least 50 horizontal feet, but the director may grant variances to no less
                  than 25 feet. Regardless of whether a trout stream is primary or secondary, for first order trout waters, which
                  are streams into which no other streams flow except for springs, the buffer shall be at least 25 horizontal feet,
                  and no variance to a smaller buffer shall be granted. The minimum subsection shall be enforced by the local
                  issuing authority;
                  Agricultural operations as defined in O.C.G.A. Â§ 1-3-3, "Definitions," to include raising, harvesting or storing of
                  products of the field or orchard; feeding, breeding or managing livestock or poultry; producing or storing feed
                  for use in the production of livestock, including but not limited to cattle, calves, swine, hogs, goats, sheep, and
                  rabbits or for use in the production of poultry, including but not limited to chickens, hens and turkeys;
                  producing plants, trees, fowl, or animals; the production of aqua culture, horticultural, dairy, livestock,
                  poultry, eggs and apiarian products; farm buildings and farm ponds;
                  Forestry land management practices, including harvesting; provided, however, that when such exempt
                  forestry practices cause or result in land-disturbing or other activities otherwise prohibited in a buffer, as
                  established in section 14-22(c)(15) and (16), no other land-disturbing activities, except for normal forest
                  management practices, shall be allowed on the entire property upon which the forestry practices were
                  conducted for a period of three years after completion of such forestry practices;
                  Any project carried out under the technical supervision of the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS)
                  of the United States Department of Agriculture;
                  Any project involving less than one acre of disturbed area; provided, however, that this exemption shall not
                  apply to any land-disturbing activity within a larger common plan of development or sale with a planned
                  disturbance of equal to or greater than one acre or within 200 feet of the bank of any state waters, and for
                  purposes of this subsection, "state waters" excludes channels and drainage ways which have water in them
                  only during and immediately after rainfall events and intermittent streams which do not have water in them
                  year-round; provided, however, that any person responsible for a project which involves less than one acre,
                  which involves land-disturbing activity, and which is within 200 feet of any such excluded channel or drainage
                  way, must prevent sediment from moving beyond the boundaries of the property on which such project is

                  road construction or maintenance project, or both, undertaken by any county or municipality; provided,
                  however, that construction or maintenance projects of the department of transportation or the state road
                  and tollway authority which disturb one or more contiguous acres of land shall be subject to provisions of
                  O.C.G.A. Â§ 12-7-7.1; except where the department of transportation, the state highway authority, or the state
                  road and tollway authority is a secondary permittee for a project located within a larger common plan of
                  development or sale under the state general permit, in which case a copy of a notice of intent under the state
                  general permit shall be submitted to the local issuing authority, the local issuing authority shall enforce
                  compliance with the minimum requirements set forth in O.C.G.A. Â§ 12-7-6 as if a permit had been issued, and
                  violations shall be subject to the same penalties as violations by permit holders;
                  Any land-disturbing activities conducted by any electric membership corporation or municipal electrical
                  system or any public utility under the regulatory jurisdiction of the public service commission, any utility
                  under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, any cable television system as
                  defined in O.C.G.A. Â§ 36-18-1, or any agency or instrumentality of the United States engaged in the
                  generation, transmission, or distribution of power; except where an electric membership corporation or
                  municipal electrical system or any public utility under the regulatory jurisdiction of the public service
                  commission, any utility under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, any
                  cable television system as defined in O.C.G.A. Â§ 36-18-1, or any agency or instrumentality of the United States
                  engaged in the generation, transmission, or distribution of power is a secondary permittee for a project
                  located within a larger common plan of development or sale under the state general permit, in which case the
                  local issuing authority shall enforce compliance with the minimum requirements set forth in O.C.G.A. Â§ 12-7-6
                  as if a permit had been issued, and violations shall be subject to the same penalties as violations by permit

                  Sec. 14-22. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices.
                  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing
                  activities if requirements of the article and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those landdisturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion,
                  sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion,
                  sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and
                  practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of this section. The application of
                  measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage
                  facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control
                  erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with
                  requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit.
                  Minimum requirements/BMPs.
                  Best management practices as set forth in subsections (b) and (c) of this section shall be required for all landdisturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall
                  constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with

                  subsection (b)(2) of this section or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of
                  storm water issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. Â§ 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act. As used in this
                  subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the
                  hydraulic design specifications contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia specified
                  in O.C.G.A. Â§ 12-7-6(b).
                  A discharge of storm water runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been
                  properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing
                  permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to
                  O.C.G.A. Â§ 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, for each day on which such discharge results in
                  the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters
                  supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as
                  trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be
                  issued by the director. This subsection shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the
                  construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale
                  unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres.
                  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any
                  land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division
                  pursuant to O.C.G.A. Â§ 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, for each day on which such failure
                  occurs.
                  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent
                  monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land-disturbing activities
                  occur.
                  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsection (c)(15) and (16), in light of
                  O.C.G.A. Â§ 12-7-6(c).
                  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. Â§ 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose
                  of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state
                  general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to
                  prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than,
                  those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the state soil
                  and water conservation commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted,
                  as well as the following:
                  Stripping of vegetation, regarding and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to
                  minimize erosion;
                  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum;
                  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practical erosion
                  potential;
                  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented;
                  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum;
                  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable;
                  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development;
                  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable;
                  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment
                  basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this subsection, a
                  disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements

                  of O.C.G.A. Â§ 12-7-1 et seq.;
                  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations
                  or the sloping of fills;
                  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property;
                  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely
                  affect other property owners;
                  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods
                  are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum;
                  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for
                  treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain
                  sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection (b)
                  (2) of this section;
                  Except as provided in subsection (16) of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks
                  of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal
                  stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as
                  protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to
                  O.C.G.A. Â§ 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided
                  that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are
                  implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means
                  a stream that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after
                  precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground
                  water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow.
                  Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to Part 6
                  of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, shall remain in force unless a
                  variance is granted by the director as provided in this subsection. The following requirements shall apply to
                  any such buffer:
                  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural,
                  undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed.
                  Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as
                  long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural
                  canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person
                  constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the
                  owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as
                  protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is
                  left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and
                  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle,
                  as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width
                  of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are
                  incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for
                  water lines; or (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines; and
                  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been
                  wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout
                  streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, except where a
                  roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams
                  classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have

                  providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the
                  downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent
                  trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided
                  that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are
                  implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer:
                  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural,
                  undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are
                  completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of
                  vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat
                  and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however,
                  that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under
                  contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time
                  as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural
                  canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and
                  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle,
                  as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width
                  of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are
                  incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for
                  water lines; or (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines.
                  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. Â§ 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and
                  regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum
                  requirements in subsection (b) and (c) of this section.
                  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another
                  shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article
                  or the terms of the permit.

                  Generally. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before
                  submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the
                  area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, storm water management ordinance, subdivision
                  ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or
                  permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority.
                  However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit.
                  Application requirements.
                  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the City of
                  Fairmount without first obtaining a permit from the city to perform such activity and providing a copy of
                  notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable.
                  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the city clerk and must include the applicant's erosion,
                  sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a
                  minimum, the data specified in subsection (c) of this section. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control
                  plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land-disturbing activity
                  proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of section 14-22(b) and (c) will be met.
                  Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by five copies of the applicant's erosion,

                  sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan
                  preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule
                  391-3-7-.10.
                  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. Â§ 12-5-23(a)(5),
                  provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be
                  calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of landdisturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees
                  shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to
                  O.C.G.A. Â§ 12-7-8(a) half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due
                  from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. Â§ 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in
                  full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction.
                  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the
                  application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the
                  erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35
                  days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending
                  plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be
                  issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by section 14-22(c)(15)
                  and (16) has been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per subsection (b)(6), have
                  been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into
                  an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan
                  without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority
                  shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing
                  authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan
                  submittal.
                  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this section, or the Erosion and
                  Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under
                  consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application.
                  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government
                  security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per
                  acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant
                  does not comply with this article or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority
                  may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to
                  stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply
                  unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any
                  determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations.
                  Plan requirements.
                  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in section 14-22(b) and (c), or
                  through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and
                  engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by
                  reference into this article. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the
                  soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed
                  permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and storm water
                  management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall
                  bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design,
                  review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land-disturbing activity shall meet the

                  the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted.
                  Permits.
                  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt
                  by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained,
                  where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include
                  conditions under which the activity may be undertaken.
                  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution
                  control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined
                  that the plan is in compliance with this article, any variances required by section 14-22(c)(15) and (16) are
                  obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per subsection (b)(6) are met and all ordinances and rules
                  and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the
                  permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant.
                  Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this
                  article, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the
                  division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority.
                  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase.
                  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of
                  the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance
                  with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in
                  violation of this article. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of
                  the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit.
                  The LIA may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or
                  the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the
                  application, in light of O.C.G.A. Â§ 12-7-7(f)(1).

                  Sec. 14-24. - Inspection and enforcement.
                  The city, or its authorized representatives or agents, will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities
                  for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan
                  and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local
                  issuing authority shall regulate both primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the
                  state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best
                  management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees
                  shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary
                  permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and
                  maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is
                  deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the
                  approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be

                  served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state
                  the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails
                  to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article.
                  The local issuing authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within 12 months of any
                  amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975.
                  The city, or its authorized representatives or agents, shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may
                  reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this article, and for this purpose to enter at
                  reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of
                  land-disturbing activities.
                  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the
                  commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents
                  appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in
                  the process of carrying out his official duties.
                  The districts or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which
                  have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. Â§ 12-7-8(a). The districts or the commission or
                  both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness
                  of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The district or the
                  commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local
                  program is found.
                  The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local
                  issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. Â§ 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of
                  the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an
                  agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing
                  authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its
                  ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A.
                  12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing
                  authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective
                  action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary
                  corrective action within 90 days after notification by the division, the division may revoke the certification of the
                  county or municipality as a local issuing authority.

                  Failure to obtain a permit for land-disturbing activity. If any person commences and land-disturbing activity
                  requiring a land-disturbing permit as prescribed in this article without first obtaining said permit, the person shall
                  be subject to revocation of his business license, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a business
                  and associated work activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority.
                  Stop-work orders.
                  For the first and second violations of the provisions of this article, the director or the local issuing authority
                  shall issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have five days to correct the violation. If the
                  violation is not corrected within five days, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a stop-work
                  order requiring that land-disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has
                  occurred; provided, however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of
                  the state or if the land-disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the
                  director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order in lieu of a warning;

                  For a third and each subsequent violation, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate sto
                  and
                  All stop-work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary
                  corrective action or mitigation has occurred.
                  When a violation in the form of taking action without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer, or
                  significant amounts of sediment, as determined by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her
                  designee, have been or are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have
                  not been properly designed, installed, and maintained, a stop work order shall be issued by the local issuing
                  authority or by the director or his or her designee. All such stop work orders shall be effective immediately
                  upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such
                  stop work orders shall apply to all land-disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and
                  maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls.
                  Bond forfeiture. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities has
                  failed to comply with the approved plan, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice
                  shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which
                  such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the
                  time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to
                  have forfeited his performance bond, if required to post one under the provisions of section 14-23(b)(6). The local
                  issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a
                  contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance.
                  Monetary penalties. Any person who violates any provisions of this article, or any permit condition or limitation
                  established pursuant to this article, or who negligently or intentionally fails or refuses to comply with any final or

                  seasonal use.
                  Start of construction (for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act
                  (PL 97-348) includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of
                  construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first
                  placement of permanent construction of a building (including a manufactured home) on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or
                  footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation or the placement of a
                  manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and
                  filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
                  piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory
                  buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main building. For a substantial
                  improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a
                  building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage
                  tank, or other manmade facilities or infrastructures.
                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its
                  before-damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
                  Substantial improvement means any combination of repairs, reconstruction, alteration, or improvements to a building, taking
                  place during the life of a building, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the building.
                  The market value of the building should be the appraised value of the building prior to the start of the initial repair or
                  improvement, or in the case of damage, the value of the building prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures
                  which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed. For the purposes of this definition,
                  substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the
                  building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however,
                  include any project for improvement of a building required to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
                  which have been identified by the code enforcement official and which are solely necessary to ensure safe living conditions.
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions means where the repair, reconstruction,
                  rehabilitation or improvements of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities
                  and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced.
                  Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction in a manner otherwise
                  prohibited by this chapter where specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship.

                  It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private
                  losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed:
                  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards,
                  or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
                  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood
                  damage at the time of initial construction;
                  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are
                  involved in the accommodation of floodwaters;
                  Control filling, grading, dredging and other developments which may increase erosion or flood damage; and
                  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may
                  increase flood hazards to other lands.

                  Sec. 16-4. - Findings of fact.
                  The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property,
                  health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures
                  for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health,
                  safety and general welfare.
                  These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood
                  heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to
                  other lands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damage.

                  The objectives of this chapter are:
                  To protect human life and health;
                  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
                  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the
                  expense of the general public;
                  To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
                  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and
                  sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains;
                  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in
                  such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; and
                  To ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

                  Sec. 16-44. - Duties and responsibilities of the building inspector.
                  Duties of the building inspector shall include, but not be limited to:
                  Review all development permits to ensure that the permit requirements of this article have been satisfied.
                  Advise permittee that additional federal or state permits may be required, and if specific federal or state
                  permit requirements are known, require that copies of such permits be provided and maintained on file with
                  the development permit.
                  Notify adjacent communities and the state department of natural resources prior to any alteration or
                  relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management
                  Agency.
                  Ensure that maintenance is provided within the altered or relocated portion of such watercourse so that the
                  flood-carrying capacity is not diminished.
                  Verify and record the actual elevation, in relation to mean sea level, of the lowest floor (including basement)
                  of all new or substantially improved buildings, in accordance with section 16-45(2).
                  Verify and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which the new or substantially
                  improved buildings have been floodproofed, in accordance with section 16-45(2).
                  In coastal hazard areas, obtain certification from a registered professional engineer or architect that the
                  building is designed and securely anchored to adequately anchored pilings or columns in order to withstand
                  velocity waters and hurricane wave wash.
                  In coastal high hazard areas, review plans for adequacy of breakaway walls in accordance with section 16-
                  45(2).
                  When floodproofing is utilized for a particular building, obtain certification from a registered professional
                  engineer or architect, in accordance with section 16-67(2).
                  Make the necessary interpretation where interpretation is needed to the exact location of boundaries of the
                  areas of special flood hazard (i.e., where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and
                  actual field conditions). The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable
                  opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in this article.
                  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 16-7,
                  obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal,
                  state or other source in order to administer the provisions of article III of this chapter.

                  Sec. 16-45. - Permit procedures.
                  Application for a development permit shall be made by the building inspector on forms furnished by him prior to any
                  development activities and may include, but not be limited to, the following plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the nature,
                  location, dimensions, and elevations of the area in question, existing or proposed structures, earthen fill, storage of materials or
                  equipment, drainage facilities, and the location of the foregoing. Specifically the following information is required:
                  Application stage.
                  Elevation in relation to mean sea level of the proposed lowest floor (including basement) of all buildings;
                  Elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any nonresidential building will be floodproofed;
                  Certificate from a registered professional engineer or architect that the nonresidential floodproofed
                  building will meet the floodproofing criteria in section 16-67(2);
                  Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as result of proposed
                  development; and
                  Construction stage. Provide a floor elevation or floodproofing certification after the lowest floor is completed,
                  or instances where the building is subject to the regulations applicable to the coastal high hazard areas, after
                  placement of the horizontal structural members of the lowest floor, or floodproofing by whatever
                  construction means, or upon placement of the horizontal structural members of the lowest floor, whichever is
                  applicable, it shall be the duty of the permit holder to submit to the building inspector a certification of the
                  elevation of the lowest portion of the horizontal structural members of the lowest floor, whichever is
                  applicable, as built, in relation to mean sea level. Such certification shall be prepared by or under the direct
                  supervision of a professional engineer or architect and certified by same. Any work undertaken prior to
                  submission of the certificate shall be at the permit holder's risk. The building inspector shall review the floor
                  elevation survey data submitted. Deficiencies detected by such review shall be corrected by the permit holder
                  immediately and prior to further progressive work being permitted to proceed. Failure to submit the survey
                  or failure to make said corrections required hereby shall be cause to issue a stop work order for the project.

                  The city council shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or
                  determination made by the building inspector in the enforcement or administration of this article.
                  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the city council or any taxpayer may appeal such decision to the Gordon
                  County Superior Court.
                  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures (see definition) upon a determination
                  that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic
                  structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
                  In passing upon such applications, the city council shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all
                  standards specified in other sections of this article, and the:
                  Danger that the materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;
                  Danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;

                  Necessity of the facility to a waterfront location, in the case of a functionally dependent facility;
                  Availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use;
                  Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;
                  Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that

                  of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and bridges.
                  Upon consideration of the factors listed in subsection (e) of this section, and the purposes of this chapter, the city
                  council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of
                  this chapter.
                  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood
                  discharge would result.
                  Conditions for variances. Variances shall only be issued upon:
                  A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief;
                  and in the instance of a historical building, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as
                  not to destroy the historic character and design of the building;
                  A showing of good and sufficient cause;
                  A determination that a failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and
                  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to
                  public safety, or extraordinary public expense, or create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the
                  public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
                  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the
                  base flood elevation and the elevation to which the building is to be built and stating that the cost of flood
                  insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.
                  The building inspector shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal
                  Emergency Management Agency upon request.

                  Sec. 16-67. - Specic standards.
                  In all areas of special flood hazard where the base flood elevation data have been provided, as set forth in section 16-7 or 16-
                  44(a)(11), the following provisions are required:
                  Residential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any residential building (or
                  manufactured home) shall have the lowest floor, including the basement, elevated no lower than one foot
                  above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate the structure,
                  openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance
                  with the standards of subsection (3) of this section.
                  Nonresidential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial, or
                  nonresidential building (or manufactured home) shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no
                  lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation. Buildings located in all A zones may be
                  floodproofed in lieu of being elevated, provided that all areas of the building below the required elevation are
                  watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and use structural components
                  having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered
                  professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such
                  certification shall be provided to the official as set forth in section 16-44(a)(9).
                  Elevated buildings. New construction or substantial improvements of elevated buildings that include fully
                  enclosed areas formed by a foundation and other exterior walls below the base flood elevation shall be
                  designed to preclude finished living space and designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to
                  automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls.
                  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or

                  every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;
                  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and
                  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided
                  they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions.
                  Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for the parking of vehicles (garage
                  door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises (standard
                  exterior door) or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator); and
                  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms.
                  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles.
                  All manufactured homes placed, or substantially improved, on individual lots or parcels, in expansions to
                  existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or in substantially improved manufactured home
                  parks or subdivisions, must meet all the requirements for new construction, including elevation and
                  anchoring.
                  All manufactured homes placed or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or
                  subdivision must be elevated so that:
                  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of
                  the base flood elevation.
                  The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers, or other foundation elements of
                  at least an equivalent strength, of no less than 36 inches in height above grade.
                  The manufactured home must be securely anchored to the adequately anchored foundation
                  system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement.
                  In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has
                  incurred substantial damage as the result of a flood, any manufactured home placed or
                  substantially improved must meet the standards of subsection (4)b.1 and 3 of this section.
                  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either:
                  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or
                  Meet all the requirements for new construction, including the anchoring and elevation
                  requirements of subsections (4)a or (4)b.1 and 3 of this section.
                  A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the
                  site only by quick-disconnect type utilities and security devices and has no permanently attached
                  structures.
                  Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 16-7 are areas designated as
                  floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry
                  debris and potential projectiles, and has erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply:
                  Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other
                  developments unless certification, with supporting technical data by a registered professional engineer,
                  is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during
                  occurrence of the base flood discharge;
                  If subsection (5)a of this section is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall
                  comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this article;
                  Prohibit the placement of a manufactured home (mobile home) park or subdivision. A replacement

                  Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 16-7, where streams exist but where no base flood
                  data has been provided, or where base flood data has been provided without floodways, the following provisions apply:
                  No encroachments, including fill material or structures, shall be located within areas of special flood hazard
                  unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect
                  of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not
                  increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community.
                  The engineering certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard hydraulic
                  engineering principles.
                  New construction or substantial improvements of buildings shall be elevated or floodproofed to elevations
                  established in accordance with section 16-67(1) and (2).

                  Following are the standards for subdivision proposals:
                  All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage;
                  All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water
                  systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage;
                  All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards; and
                  Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision proposals and other proposed development,
                  including manufactured home parks and subdivisions, which is greater than the lesser of 50 lots or five acres.

                  for any activity that fails to comply with the provisions of this article. Such stop work orders or cease and
                  desist orders may be lifted at such time as the city is satisfied that a good faith effort is being made to comply
                  with applicable provisions of this article. Nothing shall prevent the city from reissuing stop work orders and
                  cease and desist orders where warranted.
                  Injunction. If any land is used, or a building, structure, or other activity is established or maintained in
                  violation of this article, the city is authorized to and may institute, in addition to other remedies, an injunction
                  or undertake other appropriate action to cause the violation to cease or to be corrected.
                  Complaints. Whenever a violation of this article occurs or is alleged to have occurred, any person may file a written
                  complaint. Such complaint shall state clearly and fully the causes and basis of the complaint and shall be filed with
                  the city clerk. The city shall record properly such complaint, investigate, and take action thereon as may be
                  appropriate to enforce this article.
                  Penalties for violation of this article.
                  Any person violating any of the provisions of this article shall be punished by a fine or imprisonment, or both.
                  In no case shall the maximum punishment for violation of any of the provisions of this article exceed a fine of

                  Street, local, means, unless otherwise defined in a transportation plan or comprehensive plan, any public street, except an
                  alley, collector, or arterial, and which has a primary function to provide direct access to adjoining properties and which serves a
                  limited area only, usually a single land subdivision.

                  perform a secondary function of providing local access.
                  Street, marginal access, means a residential street parallel and adjacent to a major thoroughfare and which provides access
                  to abutting properties with protection from through-traffic.

                  new street or a change in existing streets. The term "subdivision" includes resubdivision and, when appropriate to the context,
                  relates either to the process of subdividing or to the actual land or area which is subdivided.

                  construction of a new public or private street; or any subdivision that involves the construction of a new public or private street.
                  Because major subdivisions involve construction of a new public or private street or the upgrade of an existing private accessway
                  to city standards, construction plans and land disturbance permits are required, and major subdivisions are therefore processed
                  in multiple steps including preliminary plat approval (unless specifically exempted), approval of construction plans and issuance
                  of land disturbance permits, and final plat approval.
                  Subdivision, minor, means a subdivision of four or fewer lots which does not involve the construction of a new public or
                  private street. Because minor subdivisions do not involve the construction of a new public or private street, they are processed
                  administratively by the city engineer as final plat applications that do not require preliminary plat approval. Any improvements to
                  an existing public street abutting the tract proposed for minor subdivision, or the installation of utilities along such existing public
                  road as may be required to comply with this division, shall be done according to plans and permit requirements of this division,
                  but such requirements shall not subject the minor subdivision to the requirements for a major subdivision as specified in this
                  division.
                  Utility means public or private water or sewer piping systems, water or sewer pumping stations, electric power lines, fuel or
                  gas pipelines, telephone lines, roads, cable telephone line, fiber optic cable, driveways, bridges, river/lake access facilities,
                  stormwater systems and drainage ways, and railroads or other utilities identified by the city. As appropriate to the context, the
                  term "utility" may also include all persons, companies, or governmental agencies supplying the same.
                  Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this division which permits construction in a manner that would
                  otherwise be prohibited by this Code; a minimal relaxation or modification of the strict terms of this division as applied to specific
                  property when, because of particular physical surroundings, shape, or topographical condition of the property, compliance would

                  Sec. 18-49. - Applicability and general provisions.
                  Applicability. These regulations shall apply to all real property within the corporate limits of the city.
                  Land is one tract until subdivided. Until property proposed for subdivision has received final plat approval and
                  been properly recorded, the land involving the subdivision shall be considered as one tract, or as otherwise legally
                  recorded.
                  All land subdivisions to comply. No person shall sell, advertise, or offer to sell, by deed, map, plat or other
                  instrument, any parcel of land not subdivided and platted under the requirements of this article. It shall be
                  unlawful for any person to transfer or sell land by reference to, or by exhibition of, or by other use of, a plat of a
                  land for a subdivision that has not been approved and recorded in accordance with the requirements of this
                  article. The description of such land by metes and bounds in the instrument of transfer shall not exempt the
                  transaction. No plat of land subdivision shall be entitled to be recorded in the office of the clerk of the superior
                  court of the county, and it shall be unlawful to record such a plat of land subdivision, unless and until it is deemed
                  to be a final plat and shall have been approved in accordance with the requirements of this article.
                  Preliminary plat and plans required prior to construction. No person shall commence construction of any
                  improvements on any lot, prior to the approval of a preliminary plat if required by this division, nor prior to
                  approval of construction plans and engineering plans for said improvements are approved as required by this
                  division and division 3 of this article.
                  Building and other permits. No building permit or certificate of occupancy shall be issued for a building, structure,
                  or use, nor shall any excavation, grading, or land disturbance applications be approved, on any parcel of land
                  regulated by this division that has not been approved in accordance with the provisions of this division.
                  Public streets and lands. No land dedicated as a public street or for other public purpose shall be opened,
                  extended, or accepted as a public street or for other public use unless such improvements are constructed in
                  accordance with the specifications of division 3 of this article and unless such land and/or improvements are
                  formally approved and accepted as public improvements by the mayor and city council in accordance with
                  procedures established in division 3 of this article.
                  Appeals. Any person aggrieved by an interpretation or decision of the city engineer or other official responsible for
                  the administration of this article may file an appeal to the city council.

                  of this article; provided, however, that such exemptions shall not apply to the land development requirements and improvement
                  requirements of division 3 of this article:
                  The creation and sale of cemetery plots.
                  The sale of lots consistent with previously approved and recorded plats or deeds.
                  The creation of leaseholds for space within a multiple-occupancy building or the division of property into
                  leaseholds for commercial, industrial, or institutional use.
                  The creation of leaseholds for the agricultural use of property where the use does not involve the
                  construction of a building to be used as a residence or for other purposes not directly related to agricultural
                  use of the land or crops or livestock raised thereon.

                  line between lots or parcels that have merged to form one lot may be removed or eliminated through a final plat revision process
                  which conforms to the requirements of this article. In the case no final plat applies to the subject lots or parcels, a boundary
                  survey and plat depicting all lots involved in the lot combination shall be required to be approved by the city council and recorded
                  as a final plat. Such combination plat shall be titled with the same name as that of the original subdivision, if applicable, and shall
                  indicate thereon that the replat is for the purpose of removing the lot lines between specific lots. (See Figure 2-2-7.1.)

                  One or more existing lot lines forming boundaries between conforming platted lots located within the same subdivision, or
                  one or more lot lines between abutting lots or parcels may be adjusted through a final plat revision process that requires the
                  approval of the city engineer and recording of a plat meeting the specifications of a final plat. In the case no final plat applies to
                  the subject lots or parcels, a boundary survey and plat of the entire lots involved in the boundary line adjustment shall be
                  required to be approved by the city engineer and recorded. Such plat showing said boundary line adjustment shall be titled with
                  the same name as that of the original subdivision and shall include thereon that the replat is for the purpose of adjusting the lot
                  lines between specific lots. (See Figure 2-2-7.2.)

                  topography or other conditions justify a departure from these standards. The city council may require pedestrian
                  ways and/or easements through the block be located near the center in blocks longer than 800 feet.
                  Block width. The width of the block shall normally be sufficient to allow two tiers of lots of appropriate depth.
                  Blocks intended for business or industrial use shall be of such width as to be considered most suitable for their
                  respective use, including adequate space for off-street parking and deliveries. (See Figure 2-2-9.2.1.)

                  Natural features and assets. In the subdividing of land, due regard shall be shown for all natural features, such as
                  tree growth, watercourses, historic sites or similar conditions which, if preserved, will add attractiveness and
                  ensure safety from hazards to the proposed development.
                  Access and minimum lot frontage. Each lot shall have access to a public street with a minimum of 50 feet of lot
                  frontage on a public street; provided further, that in the case of a lot accessed by a circular cul-de-sac, the
                  minimum lot frontage may be reduced to 30 feet.
                  Adequate buildable area required. Land subject to flooding, improper drainage or erosion, or that is otherwise
                  unsuitable for residential or other use for topographical or other reasons, shall not be platted for residential use

                  the hazards can be and are corrected. Each lot shall contain an adequate building site not subject to flooding and
                  outside the limits of any existing easements or building setback lines required by the local governing body. (See
                  Figure 2-2-10.3.1.)
                  Lot remnants not permitted. All remnants of lots below any required minimum lot size that may be required, left
                  over after subdividing of a larger tract, must be added to adjacent lots, rather than allowed to remain as unusable
                  parcels. The city engineer may permit a lot remnant for a specific purpose such as a recreational area or a
                  detention pond; provided that access and design is appropriate and the lot remnant is restricted to specific
                  nonbuilding use.
                  Service areas. Commercial and industrial lots shall be adequate to provide service areas and off-street parking
                  suitable to the use intended.
                  Lot area. The minimum lot area shall not be less than that established by the land use intensity district in which the
                  subdivision is located, if applicable.
                  Lot width. No portion of a lot shall be narrower than 60 feet, with the exception of cul-de-sac lots, nor shall any lot
                  have a lot width less than that established by the land use intensity district in which the subdivision is located, if

                  Lot depth. Lots shall have a depth of not less than 100 feet, unless circumstances make these limitations
                  impracticable.
                  Flag lots. No lot shall be approved which constitutes a flag lot except with special approval from the city council due
                  to extreme topographic circumstances.
                  Side lot lines. Insofar as practical, side lot lines shall be at right angles to straight street lines or radial to curved
                  street lines.
                  Corner lots. Corner lots shall have adequate width to meet the front building setback requirements, if applicable,
                  from all rights-of-way.
                  Double frontage lots. Double frontage or through lots should be avoided except where essential to provide
                  separation of residential development from arterials or overcome specific disadvantages of topography or
                  orientation. Double frontage lots with frontage on a major arterial street shall have at least 50 feet of additional
                  depth in order to allow space for screen planting along the lot line abutting a major arterial street.

                  provider. Where easements are needed for public water and/or sanitary sewer lines, they shall be provided as determined
                  appropriate by the city engineer. All easements required pursuant to this section shall be shown on the preliminary plat and final
                  plat.

                  land lot lines, prior to final plat approval. Lot corners shall be marked with metal rods not less than one-half inch in diameter and
                  18 inches in length and driven so as to be stabilized in the ground. Permanent survey monuments shall also be installed in

                  subdivisions for review and approval by the city council.
                  When required. All major subdivisions, and any subdivision involving the dedication of a public street, shall require
                  the submission of a preliminary plat to the city engineer for review and approval by the city council. Prior to the
                  issuance of any permit for land disturbance, or the installation of any improvements, the city council must approve
                  the preliminary plat, if required.
                  Preliminary plat application and specifications. Preliminary plat applications shall be made in accordance with the
                  requirements shown in section 18-59(b), and preliminary plats shall meet the minimum plat specifications shown
                  in section 18-59(e).

                  approve, conditionally approve, or deny the preliminary plat application. The basis of the city council's review of and a
                  preliminary plat shall be whether the preliminary plat meets the purposes and requirements of this division, and all o
                  that relate to the proposed development.
                  Disposition. Approval of a preliminary plat shall be valid for a period of one year, after which time a complete
                  construction plans application or building permit must be submitted. If a completed application for construction
                  plans is not submitted during that time, preliminary plat approval shall expire and be null and void.
                  Appeal. Denial of preliminary plat approval may be appealed to the mayor and city council.
                  Amendments to approved preliminary plats. The city engineer is authorized to approve minor amendments to
                  approved preliminary plats. Any proposed amendment to a sketch plat that is determined by the city engineer to
                  constitute a public interest shall be deemed a major amendment. For all amendments to preliminary plats
                  determined to be major amendments, city council approval shall be required. The city council shall approve,
                  conditionally approve, or deny any proposed major amendment to a preliminary plat. Procedures for considering a
                  major amendment to a preliminary plat shall be the same as required for an initial application for preliminary plat
                  approval.

                  Application. Upon approval of a preliminary plat, the subdivider or land developer may apply for construction plan
                  approval. In the case of a minor subdivision, or in cases where a preliminary plat is not required by this article, the
                  subdivider or land developer may apply for approval of construction plans; provided, however, that in the case of a
                  minor subdivision or land development, the applicant for construction plan approval should hold a preapplication
                  conference with the city engineer to ensure that plans meet the intent and specific provisions of this ordinance and
                  other applicable regulations. The construction plan approval process is administrative. Applications for
                  construction plan approval shall be made in accordance with the requirements shown in section 18-59(b) and (e).
                  No application for construction plans shall be accepted for processing nor approved by the city engineer until a
                  preliminary plat, if required, has been approved by the city council and the proposed construction plans are found
                  by the city engineer to be in substantial conformity with said approval and any conditions of such approval, and
                  applicable state laws and local ordinances.
                  City engineer's decision criteria. The only basis upon which the city engineer may deny a construction plan is the
                  failure of the application to meet the requirements of this article or any other applicable local regulations or the
                  failure of the construction plans and application to meet the requirements of preliminary plat approval specified by
                  the city council.
                  Certificate of approval. All copies of the construction plans shall be noted by inscription on the plat noting such
                  approval by the city engineer. Construction plan approval shall expire and be null and void after a period of one
                  year, unless activity toward improvements on the land has been initiated, or unless the city engineer approves an
                  extension of time.

                  Sec. 18-59. - Final plat.
                  When required. All major subdivisions, minor subdivisions, and dedications shall require final plat approval. The
                  final plat approval process is administrative. Applications shall be made in accordance with the requirements

                  In order to protect the city and prospective purchasers of and residents in a subdivision, the subdivider/developer shall
                  provide to the city financial security to guarantee the installation of public improvements. The subdivider's or developer's financial
                  guarantee may be any of the following:
                  An escrow of funds with the city;
                  An escrow with a bank or savings and loan association upon which the city can draw;
                  An irrevocable letter of commitment or credit upon which the city can draw;

                  and
                  Any other form of guarantee approved by the city attorney and accepted by the mayor and city council that
                  will satisfy the objectives of this section. The guarantee shall be in an amount to secure the full costs, as
                  determined by the city, of constructing or installing the improvements and utilities required.

                  Sec. 18-62. - Limitations on minor subdivisions.
                  Intent. It is the intent of the mayor and city council to prohibit the practice of dividing a parcel via consecutive
                  and/or contiguous minor subdivisions instead of filing for a major subdivision where the same land owner
                  subdivides land and then files minor subdivision applications on common contiguous parcels, which collectively
                  total more than four lots. It is also the intent of the mayor and city council to prohibit minor subdivisions adjacent
                  to each other within a three-year time period, in cases where part of an original tract of land is now owned by
                  another person or entity and was transferred or sold to another owner with the apparent intent to circumvent the
                  major subdivision process.
                  Common contiguous parcels shown on minor subdivision plats. Contiguous common parcels, as defined by this
                  division, shall be referenced on all applications for minor subdivisions, and contiguous common parcels shall be
                  considered part of any application for a minor subdivision, for purposes of determining whether or not the division
                  of land proposed is a major subdivision or a minor subdivision. Common contiguous parcels shall not be counted
                  as lots in the case of a minor subdivision.
                  Limitations. Land within a minor subdivision, including all contiguous parcels owned by the subdivider, shall not be
                  further divided for a period of three years unless a preliminary plat application is filed and approved as a major
                  subdivision pursuant to the requirements of this division. If property proposed to be subdivided was part of an
                  original tract, and if the property proposed to be subdivided abuts land that has been divided as a minor
                  subdivision in the last three years, then minor subdivision of said property shall be prohibited. This provision shall
                  not be construed to prohibit the approval of two contiguous minor subdivisions under separate ownership;
                  however, this provision is intended to be construed liberally so that one property owner does not develop a minor
                  subdivision on part of an original tract and transfer or sell another part of the original tract for the purpose of
                  minor subdivision within a three-year period. It is the intent that land abutting a minor subdivision that was owned
                  by the subdivider of the abutting minor subdivision shall not be subdivided as a minor subdivision for a period of
                  three years, regardless of ownership.

                  (b)
                  The purpose of this division is to establish minimum design requirements, standards, and specifications for improvements
                  within subdivisions and other land developments in the city.

                  The city engineer is hereby authorized to review and approve plans for subdivisions and other land developments to ensure
                  compliance with the requirements of this Code. The city engineer is further authorized to prepare and promulgate standards,
                  standard drawings, and specifications to more specifically implement the intent of the improvement requirements of this Code.

                  Sec. 18-86. - Applicability and exemption.
                  The improvement requirements specified in this division shall apply to all non-single-family residential
                  developments. The improvement requirements specified in this division shall not apply to individual lots proposed
                  for development as a detached, single-family dwelling or manufactured home, although such lots may be a part of
                  a land subdivision that has initially met the requirements of this division. All improvements required to be
                  constructed as part of a major subdivision, minor subdivision or land development process shall be constructed
                  and improved, in accordance with the standards and specifications for construction as required by this division,
                  and as specified by the city engineer.
                  No person to which this division applies shall commence construction of any improvements on any land, prior to
                  the approval of construction plans and engineering plans for such improvements, as required by section 18-87,
                  according to the improvement standards specified in this division and as adopted by the city engineer. No building
                  permit or certificate of occupancy shall be issued for a building, structure, or use, nor shall any excavation, grading,
                  or land disturbance applications be approved, on any parcel of land that does not meet the improvement
                  requirements specified in this division and as adopted by the city engineer pursuant to this division.

                  Engineering drawings for public streets, including cross sections and centerline profiles, and public and private water, sewer,
                  drainage, and utility systems, certified by a professional engineer registered in the state, or if authorized under state law, a
                  registered land surveyor, or professional landscape architect, shall be required to be submitted for review and approval, and such
                  plans must meet the requirements of this division and the specifications of the city engineer. Prior to approval and recording of a
                  final plat, or prior to the approval of any certificate of occupancy, a registered engineer for the subdivider/developer shall submit
                  one copy of all finished, as-built plans of improvements, demonstrating that such improvements, as installed, meet the
                  requirements of this division and certifying that the plans accurately reflect actual construction and installation. The city engineer
                  shall maintain all as-built street and utility plans for future use by the city.

                  Permits from the city shall be required for construction in any public right-of-way. Permits will not be issued until such time
                  that plans have been submitted and approved by the city engineer. Permit fees shall be approved by resolution of the mayor and
                  city council.

                  Sec. 18-89. - Improvements to abutting land.
                  For subdivisions and land developments that abut and access an abutting public street, the subdivider or land developer shall
                  install curbs and gutters, sidewalks, other road improvements, and, if required, acceleration/deceleration lanes, according to
                  standards and specifications of the city engineer, along abutting public streets. When a subdivision or land development uses an
                  unpaved public right-of-way for access, the subdivider or land developer shall improve that right-of-way to a pavement width
                  consistent with city road design standards. Such improvements shall be from the subdivision or land development entrance to
                  the paved city street which the city engineer determines will be the primary direction of travel for residents of the subdivision or
                  occupants of the land development.

                  Sec. 18-90. - Standards for conguring new streets.
                  Street alignment, intersections and jogs. Streets shall be aligned to join with planned or existing streets. Under
                  normal conditions, streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles (90 degrees), but
                  in no case shall such a street intersection be less than 75 degrees. Where street offsets or jogs cannot be avoided,
                  offset T-intersections shall be separated by a minimum centerline offset of 150 feet in urban areas and 300 feet in
                  rural areas. (See Figure 2-3-8.1.1.)
                  Continuation of existing streets and connections. Existing streets, and their rights-of-way, shall be continued at the
                  same or greater width, but in no case less than the required width. The city may require that a major subdivision
                  provide one or more future connections to adjoining subdivisions or unsubdivided tracts.

                  Street plans for future phases of the tract. Where the plat or site plan proposed to be subdivided or developed includ
                  of the tract owned or intended for subdivision or development by the subdivider or land developer, a tentative plan o
                  street system for the portion not slated for immediate subdivision consideration may be required by the city and shal
                  prepared and submitted by the subdivider or land developer as part of the preliminary plat.
                  Dead-end streets and cul-de-sacs. Streets that dead end shall terminate in a cul-de-sac. The maximum length of
                  such streets shall be 600 feet. Streets that are planned to continue at some future date shall provide a temporary
                  cul-de-sac as required by the city engineer, and a permanent right-of-way extended for the full future street length.
                  Marginal access streets. Whenever a major subdivision is proposed abutting the right-of-way of a U.S. or state
                  highway, a marginal access street approximately parallel and adjacent to such right-of-way may be required by the
                  city at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of land between such marginal access street and highway rightof-way. The city may also require a 20-foot no-access easement and planting strip along the major arterial street to
                  ensure that lots fronting on said street do not have access thereto. (See Figure 2-3-8.5.1.)
                  Alleys and service access. Alleys may be provided. If they are provided, they must be paved. Dead-end alleys shall
                  be avoided were possible; but if unavoidable, they shall be provided with adequate turnaround facilities. Service
                  access shall be provided for all commercial and industrial developments for off-street loading, unloading, and
                  parking consistent with and adequate for the uses proposed.

                  Bridges. Bridges on public rights-of-way shall meet current American Association of State Highway and
                  Transportation Officials standards, as determined by the city engineer.
                  Grading and stabilization of street rights-of-way. When a proposed public street is constructed, all trees, brush,
                  stumps, rocks, or other debris shall be cleared from the street rights-of-way, except in cases where trees are
                  required to be preserved by the city in a manner acceptable to the city engineer. All streets shall be graded to lines,

                  stabilized by seeding, fertilizing, and mulching or by another equally effective method.
                  Radius at street intersections. The right-of-way radius at street intersections shall be a minimum of 15 feet, with
                  larger radii for streets serving nonresidential development, as approved by the city engineer. The minimum
                  pavement (curb) radius at street intersections shall be 25 feet.
                  Street grades. No street grade shall be less than two percent. No street grade for an arterial or collector street shall
                  exceed eight percent. No other local street grade shall exceed 12 percent, unless the city engineer finds that due to
                  topographic conditions, a steeper grade is necessary, in which case the street grade shall not exceed 15 percent.
                  Grades between 12 percent and 15 percent shall not exceed a length of 150 feet.
                  Minimum street right-of-way, pavement widths, and construction. Street right-of-way and pavement widths shall at
                  a minimum meet the following, and street construction shall conform to construction specifications detailed in
                  chapter 11, sec. 11-32 of the Code of Ordinances of Gordon County, referenced herein as if quoted in its entirety,

                  Entrance improvement specifications. Roadway entrances and improvements, including necessary acceleration
                  and/or deceleration lanes and right/left turn lanes, shall be designed, installed, and maintained as approved by the
                  state department of transportation, as applicable, or the city engineer in accordance with state or city
                  specifications. All entrances or exits of any street or driveway, public or private, from or to any state highway shall
                  be approved by the state department of transportation and the city engineer prior to the construction of such
                  entrances or exits and prior to the issuance of any land use permit or building permit for any improvement to be
                  served by such entrances or exits. All entrances or exits of any street or driveway, public or private, from or to any
                  city street shall be approved by the city engineer prior to the construction of such entrances or exits and prior to
                  the issuance of any land use permit or building permit for any improvement to be served by such entrances or
                  exits.
                  Curb cut specifications.
                  No curb cut or access driveway shall be permitted to be located closer than 100 feet to the nearest existing or
                  proposed right-of-way of an intersecting roadway or closer than 40 feet to a side property line unless the
                  adjacent property owner is in agreement with the encroachment of the driveway and approval is obtained
                  from the city engineer. Curb cuts or access driveways shall be no narrower than 24 feet from back of curb to
                  back of curb. Strict adherence to these requirements may not be practical in all instances as determined by
                  the city engineer. The city engineer may limit the maximum width of a curb cut and/or the number of curb
                  cuts to a parcel as necessary when it is deemed to be of benefit to the safety and welfare of the public.
                  The following factors may be considered during the review and approval of a specific location of an entrance:
                  The location of existing or planned median breaks;
                  Separation requirements between the entrance and major intersections;
                  Separation requirements between other entrances;

                  Sec. 18-95. - Curbs and gutters.
                  Curbs and gutters shall be installed if required by the city engineer in accordance with standards and specifications
                  of the city engineer. Subdivisions consisting totally of lots intended for single-family residential use containing a
                  minimum of two acres shall not require curbs and gutters; provided, however, that curbs are required for all roads
                  when sidewalks are required by these regulations. All commercial and industrial subdivisions and land
                  developments must have curbs and gutters, regardless of the size of the lots. When property fronting on an
                  existing city street is subdivided or developed, and the subdivision or land development uses such existing street
                  for access, then curb and gutter shall be required along the street along the entire property frontage of the street.
                  Curbs shall be concrete which shall be class A 3,000 psi strength at 28 days. The typical curb minimum section shall
                  be six inches by 24 inches by 12 inches (See Figure 2-3-13.1).
                  All streets and roads not required to include curbs and gutters shall be graded, paved, and drained to meet all
                  construction and drainage standards for ditches, slopes, and grassing according to specifications established by

                  Sec. 18-96. - Sidewalks.
                  When required. Sidewalks shall be provided unless the city determines that no public need exists for sidewalks in a
                  certain location. Sidewalks shall be required when land developments and subdivisions are located within one mile
                  of a public school. Sidewalks are required to be installed along one side of the street internal to a major
                  subdivision, except in cases where the average lot size of the major subdivision is two acres or more.
                  Location. Sidewalks shall be included within the dedicated nonpavement right-of-way of roads and shall parallel
                  the street pavement as much as possible; provided, however, the city engineer may permit sidewalks to be
                  designed and constructed so that they meander around permanent obstructions or deviate from a linear pattern
                  for design purposes.
                  Specifications. Sidewalks shall be a minimum of four feet wide. A median strip of grassed or landscaped areas at
                  least two feet wide shall separate all sidewalks from adjacent curbs in residential areas.

                  Sec. 18-97. - Drainage and stormwater management.
                  General requirements. An adequate drainage system, separate and independent of any sanitary sewer system and
                  including any necessary ditches, pipes, culverts, intersectional drains, drop inlets, bridges, etc., shall be provided
                  for the proper drainage of all surface water for all subdivisions and land developments. Sizing and location of all
                  drainage structures shall be the responsibility of a registered professional engineer or land surveyor. The city
                  engineer may require the use of on-site control methods such as retention or detention, designed by a
                  professional engineer, to mitigate the stormwater and drainage impacts of the proposed subdivisions and land
                  developments on downstream landowners. The city shall not approve any preliminary plat of subdivision that does
                  not make adequate provision for stormwater and floodwater runoff channels or basins as determined by the city
                  engineer. No building permit shall be issued for any building within a subdivision or for the development of land, if
                  there is not present throughout the subdivision or to the land development an adequate system of drainage and
                  stormwater management.
                  Method of design and capacity. Storm sewers, within a subdivision, shall be designed by the rational method, or
                  other methods as approved by the city engineer, and a copy of design computations shall be submitted along with
                  required plans. Drainage improvements shall accommodate potential runoff from the entire upstream drainage
                  area within the site and shall be designed to prevent increases in downstream flooding. Capacity for a ten-year
                  storm or rain shall be provided for all street drainage structures such as catchbasins, inlets cross drains, etc.
                  Capacity for a 100-year frequency storm event shall be provided for all main drainage structures such as retention
                  basins, principal storm sewers, and all types of flood protection works.
                  Location. Drainage facilities shall be located in the road right-of-way where feasible, and shall be constructed in
                  accordance with standards and specifications of the city engineer. Catchbasins shall be located at low points of
                  streets. Where topography or other conditions are such as to make impractical the inclusion of drainage facilities
                  within road rights-of-way, perpetual, unobstructed easements at least 15 feet in width for drainage facilities shall
                  be provided across property outside the road right-of-way and with satisfactory access to the road. Drainage
                  easements shall be platted as part of the final plat.
                  Discharge. Drainage shall be designed so as to avoid concentration of storm drainage water from each lot or land
                  development site to adjacent lots, land development sites, or vacant properties. It shall be directed toward natural
                  drainages. If water must be discharged to a stream, the water quality flowing into the stream must meet or exceed

                  (c)
                  the water quality in the receiving waters. The water quantity flowing into the stream must be evaluated to ensure
                  the stream channel can accommodate the increased flows and not disrupt or degrade the ecology of the water
                  body.
                  Grading and site drainage. Lots or land development sites shall be laid out so as to provide positive drainage away
                  from all buildings, and drainage for individual lots or land development sites shall be coordinated with the general
                  storm drainage pattern for the area. Buildings and parking lots shall be appropriately drained so as to prevent
                  damage to abutting properties or public streets. All disturbed or graded ground areas of a building site not used
                  for buildings or open storage areas shall be appropriately stabilized and grassed or covered with plants or
                  landscaping materials.
                  Cross drainpipes. Where a watercourse separates the buildable area of a lot from the street by which it has access,
                  provisions shall be made for installation of a culvert or other structure, the design of which shall be approved by
                  the city engineer. Cross drains shall be provided to accommodate all natural waterflow, and shall be of sufficient
                  length to permit full-width roadways and the required slopes. Cross drainpipes shall have head walls of an
                  approved type on inlet and outlet ends of the pipe. Pipe installed within the right-of-way shall be reinforced
                  concrete pipe. All storm drainpipes shall be minimum 18 inches in diameter. Storm sewer slopes shall be equal to
                  or greater than one percent.
                  Drop inlets. Drop inlets shall be generally three-foot by three-foot boxes with two-foot by three-foot grates unless
                  otherwise specified by the city engineer.
                  Easements. Where an irrigation ditch or channel, natural creek, stream or other drainage way crosses a subdivision
                  or land development, the subdivider or developer shall provide an easement sufficient for drainage and
                  maintenance and shown on the final plat. Easements shall be provided for all drainage facilities as approved by the
                  city engineer. When a subdivision or land development is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway, channel, or
                  intermittent stream, a stormwater or drainage easement of at least 20 feet shall be provided.

                  Sec. 18-98. - Potable water.
                  Generally. All habitable buildings and buildable lots shall be connected to a water system capable of providing
                  water for health and emergency purposes, including adequate fire protection. No building permit shall be issued
                  for any building within a subdivision or for the development of land, if there is not present throughout the
                  subdivision or to the land development an adequate water supply.
                  Water main requirements. When a public water main is accessible, the developer shall install adequate water
                  facilities, including fire hydrants, according to specifications of the city engineer. All water mains shall normally be
                  at least six inches in diameter except that pipe of lesser size may be used if properly looped and adequate water
                  pressure is maintained in accordance with standards established by the Southeastern Fire Underwriters
                  Association. Pipe of less than four inches shall not be used except in unusual cases. Water lines shall be installed
                  with at least 36 inches of cover below grade. Water mains within subdivisions and land developments must be
                  provided with connections to each lot in the subdivision and each land development, except as otherwise
                  specifically provided, and each connection shall consist of a separate water meter for each dwelling unit.
                  Community water system. If a municipal water supply is not available to the subdivision or land development at the
                  time of constructing improvements for a subdivision or land development, then the subdivider or developer shall
                  provide an adequate alternative water source and an adequate water storage facility. Any community water
                  system, if allowed, shall provide a minimum flow of 400 gallons per day per each lot platted, whether or not each
                  lot is to be immediately developed; shall be sanitary; and shall have a minimum pressure of 30 pounds per square
                  inch at each lot in the subdivision or each land development to be served. For all common nonpublic water supply
                  systems, acceptable management, maintenance, and distribution policies and procedures shall be established.

                  perspective lot owner on a continuing, ongoing basis, and to provide acceptable means for repairs and unforeseen
                  events. The community water system plan shall be approved by the county health department and a letter of
                  approval from the state department of natural resources shall accompany the final plat or land development
                  application.
                  Fire protection. Fire hydrants shall be required for all land developments and all subdivisions. Fire hydrants with
                  appropriate water pressure at appropriate intervals throughout the subdivision or land development shall be
                  provided by the subdivider or land developer as required by the county fire department. Fire hydrants shall be
                  located no more than 1,000 feet apart and within 500 feet of any principal dwelling. Hydrants, fittings, valves and
                  fire department connections shall be approved by the fire department. Fire department connections shall be not
                  less than 18 inches or more with slopes to obtain a minimum velocity of two feet per second. Minimum 20-footwide permanent easements shall be provided for all sanitary sewer lines.

                  development, and if sanitary sewer is not anticipated to be available within a period of three years to serve the
                  subdivision or land development in question, then an on-site disposal system shall be installed by and at the
                  expense of the subdivider, land developer, or lot purchaser, in conformity with the requirements of the state and
                  county health department and according to specifications adopted by the city engineer.
                  Septic tanks. Where individual on-site wastewater disposal systems are allowed and proposed, individual lot sizes
                  and shapes must exhibit appropriate regard for the peculiar health, drainage, and maintenance characteristics on
                  the site. Additionally, detailed soil tests may be required in order to verify the ability of the lots to safely contain
                  and dispose of septic system effluent. All septic tanks and on-site wastewater disposal systems are subject to the
                  approval of the state and the county health department.

                  Sec. 18-100. - Utilities.
                  All utility facilities including, but not limited to, gas, electric power, telephone, and cable television, shall be located
                  underground throughout the subdivision or land development. Whenever existing utility facilities are located above ground,
                  except when existing on public roads and rights-of-way, they shall be removed and placed underground. Easements centered on
                  rear lot lines shall be provided for utilities, private and public, and such easements shall be at least ten feet wide. When
                  topographical or other conditions are such as to make impractical the inclusion of utilities along the rear lot lines of a subdivision,
                  lot, or land development site, perpetual unobstructed easements at least ten feet in width shall be provided along side lot lines
                  with satisfactory access.

                  The subdivider or land developer shall construct such oversized improvements and utilities that the city engineer determines
                  are necessary, provided that the subdivider or land developer shall not be obligated for the additional cost of improvements and
                  utilities that are not uniquely required for that development, and provided the subdivider agrees to a proposal by the city
                  engineer to share in the cost arrangements for oversizing improvements and utilities. A formula may be developed by the city to
                  provide for a sharing of the cost of other improvements needed to serve the subdivision or land development when certain of the
                  improvements are necessary to serve future subdivisions or developments in the vicinity.

                  Upon completion of public improvement construction, the subdivider or land developer shall notify the city and request an
                  inspection. The city engineer shall inspect all public improvements and shall notify the subdivider or land developer by mail of
                  nonacceptance or preliminary acceptance. If the public improvements are not acceptable, the reason for nonacceptance shall be
                  stated and corrective measures shall be outlined in a letter of notification. Upon notification, the subdivider or land developer
                  shall correct all deficiencies identified in the nonacceptance letter within the time limit established by the city engineer. Once
                  deficiencies are corrected, the subdivider or land developer shall again request inspection in writing. Acceptance of public
                  improvements required by division 2 of this article to be approved by the local governing body shall be forwarded to the
                  governing body following receipt of written approval of the city engineer.

                  and service areas, consisting of natural vegetation that forms a screen between incompatible land uses for the purpose of visibly
                  separating uses through distance and to shield and block noise, light, glare, or visual or other nuisances. The width of a buffer is
                  measured from the common property line and extending the developed portion of the common property line. A buffer consists of
                  trees, shrubs, berming, and other natural vegetation which remains undisturbed but which may be replanted where sparsely
                  vegetated, or which must be replanted where disturbed by approved access and utility crossings.

                  Sec. 18-135. - Building height.
                  Generally. No building or structure shall hereafter be erected or altered so as to exceed the height limits
                  established by subsection (b) of this section for different types of buildings and structures. The height limitations of
                  subsection (b) of this section shall not apply to church spires, belfries, cupolas and domes not intended for human
                  occupancy, flagpoles, or public utility facilities.
                  Maximum height limitations. The following maximum heights are established for types of land uses:

                  (b)
                  of buildings on properties abutting a single-family dwelling, including a manufactured home, shall be limited
                  according to the provisions of this section. When a nonresidential building or structure is proposed to be
                  erected on property that abuts property containing one or more single-family dwellings or manufactured
                  homes, the height of such nonresidential building or structure abutting one or more single-family dwellings or
                  manufactured homes shall meet the requirements of this subsection.
                  The height of a nonresidential building or structure on property abutting a single-family dwelling shall not
                  exceed 35 feet; provided, however, that such nonresidential building or structure may be increased in height
                  beyond the 35-foot maximum by one foot for every five feet the nonresidential building is set back from the
                  minimum required side or rear building setback, or ten feet from the side or rear property line if no required
                  side or rear yard is established, up to a maximum required setback of 100 feet (see subsection (b) of this
                  section). The following table provides maximum heights at five-foot increments of building height based on
                  this performance standard:

                  No building shall hereafter be erected in a manner to have narrower or smaller side yards or rear yards than
                  specified for the use in this article. No part of a required side yard or rear yard shall be included as a part of the
                  yard required for another building. The application of buffer requirements, as established by section 18-137(c),
                  supersedes these minimum required yards. (See subsection (b) of this section.)

                  manufactured homes, or any other similar vehicle, that meets one or more of the following conditions:
                  Has been left unattended upon a highway, street, or alley or other public property outside a designated
                  parking space for a period of 48 hours; and/or

                  It is important for a community to appear clean, well-kept, and generally clear of public nuisances, eyesores, and unhealthy
                  conditions. The appearance of a community weighs heavily in the decisions of prospective residents and businesses in locating to
                  a particular area. A clean, safe, and well-kept community can stabilize or increase property values, provide a healthy environment,
                  and make citizens proud of the area in which they live. Accordingly, a community needs a set of regulations to keep the area
                  clean, remove unsightly conditions, and prevent unhealthy and unsafe situations from occurring. It is therefore the purpose and
                  intent of this article to encourage a clean, healthy, and satisfying environment, and one free of nuisances, eyesores, and
                  unhealthy, unsafe, or devaluating conditions. To this end, this article seeks to regulate and protect the health, safety, welfare,
                  values, and aesthetics of properties in the city.

                  Sec. 20-86. - Purpose.
                  This article regulates mobile home parks, manufactured home parks, and recreational vehicle and travel trailer parks and
                  campgrounds, which provide for affordable permanent and temporary housing or seasonal recreational developments.
                  Manufactured home parks are intended to provide for the leasing of spaces for the placement of manufactured homes, owned or
                  rented by tenants, as well as spaces or campsites for recreational vehicles, within a planned residential community, park, or
                  campground. A manufactured home park is different from a residential subdivision in that the individual spaces for manufactured
                  homes, campsites, or recreational vehicles are leased rather than platted and sold. By requiring less land per home or vehicle
                  space, manufactured home parks are built at densities greater than those for other detached dwellings. Service facilities such as
                  laundry and leasing office are often planned and provided as a part of the park development.

                  Sec. 20-87. - Site plan review and land use permit required.
                  No manufactured home park shall be developed until and unless a site plan shall have been approved by the city and a land
                  use permit is issued by the city. The city shall not issue a land use permit for a manufactured home park unless it is in conformity
                  with all the provisions of this article.

                  Sec. 20-88. - Site conditions and site planning.
                  Site conditions. Manufactured home parks shall be sited on land that is not subject to hazards such as flooding,
                  erosion, land subsidence, and areas with possible insect or rodent infestation. The condition of the soil,
                  groundwater level, drainage, rock formations, and topography shall be appropriate for the use to ensure that no
                  hazards to the property or to the health and safety of the occupants occurs.
                  Site planning. Planning for the manufacturing home park should be adapted to individual site conditions and the
                  type of use or uses served, reflect advances in site planning techniques, and be adapted to the trends in the design
                  of the manufactured home or recreational vehicle itself. Site planning and improvements shall: provide for facilities
                  and amenities appropriate to the needs of the occupants; safe, comfortable, and sanitary use by the occupants
                  under all weather conditions; and practical and efficient operation and maintenance of all facilities at reasonable
                  costs. The street and block pattern for the park shall be designed to attain proper sizes and shapes of
                  manufactured home spaces so as to provide desirable areas and to reduce excessive length of street construction
                  without impairing convenient circulation and access.

                  The manufactured home park shall have a minimum lot width of 200 feet throughout the entire depth of the
                  developed portion of the property. (See Figure 4-5-5.1.1.)
                  Perimeter buffer or landscape screen. A minimum 20-foot-wide buffer, where natural vegetation exists and
                  provides a more or less opaque screen; or, where no natural vegetation forming an opaque screen exists, a
                  minimum 20-foot-wide landscape strip with evergreen trees that will grow to a height of at least six feet
                  within three years shall be installed and maintained around the entire perimeter of the development, except
                  for approved access and utility crossings. (See Figure 4-5-5.1.1.)
                  Open space and recreational areas. A minimum of 20 percent of the site area shall be open space and
                  recreational area, including the required perimeter buffer or landscape screen. A minimum of eight percent

                  sampling, and flow measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage systems. The monitoring facility should normally
                  be situated on the user's premises, but the city may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the
                  user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area and located so that it will not be obstructed by
                  landscaping or parked vehicles. There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility to allow accurate
                  sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility, sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all
                  times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user.

                  Within nine months of the promulgation of a national categorical pretreatment standard, the wastewater discharge permit of
                  users subject to such standards shall be revised to require compliance with such standard within the timeframe prescribed by
                  such standard. Where a user, subject to a national categorical pretreatment standard, has not previously submitted an application
                  for a wastewater discharge permit, the user shall apply for a wastewater discharge permit within 180 days after the promulgation
                  of the applicable national categorical pretreatment standard. In addition, the user with an existing wastewater discharge permit
                  shall submit to the city manager, within 180 days after the promulgation of an applicable federal categorical pretreatment
                  standard, the necessary information listed in section 28-195.

                  Each user shall provide protection from accidental discharge or slug loading of prohibited materials or other substances
                  regulated by this division. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge or slug loading of prohibited materials shall be provided and
                  maintained at the owner's or user's own cost and expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide
                  this protection shall be submitted to the city for review, before construction of the facility. All existing users shall complete such a
                  plan by July 1, 1993. No user who commences contribution to the wastewater system after the effective date of the ordinance
                  from which this division is derived shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until accidental discharge or slug
                  loading procedures have been approved by the city. Review of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the

                  the incident. The notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, and corrective
                  actions.
                  Written notice. Within five days following an accidental discharge or slug loading, the user shall submit to the
                  city manager a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by
                  the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense,
                  loss, damage or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the wastewater system, fish
                  kills, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil
                  penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this article or other applicable law.
                  Notice to employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent
                  place advising employees whom to call in the event of a dangerous discharge. Employers shall ensure that all
                  employees who may cause or suffer such a dangerous discharge to occur are advised of the emergency
                  notification procedure.
