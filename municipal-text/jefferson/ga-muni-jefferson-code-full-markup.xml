PREFACE 
</p>
        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE This Code constitutes a codification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Jefferson, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of any ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Senior Code Attorney, and Timothy MacMartin, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Mr. John Ward, City Manager, Mr. David Clabo, former City Manager, and Mr. Ronald K. Hopkins, City Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Supplement History Table

(d)  When used in such attachment, the terms "tract" and "BG" (block group) shall mean and describe the same geographical boundaries as provided in the report of the Bureau of the Census for the United States decennial census of 2000 for the State of Georgia.

                  Sec. 15. - To whom proceeds of bonds shall be paid. 
                  In the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, the authority shall provide for the payment of the proceeds of the sale of the revenue bonds to any officer or person who, or any agency, bank, or trust company which, shall act as trustee of such funds and shall hold and apply the same to the purposes thereof, subject to such regulations as this Act and such resolution or trust indenture may provide.

                  (3)  Any premium upon such revenue bonds as the same shall fall due; 
                  (4)  The purchase of such revenue bonds in the open market; and 
                  (5)  The necessary charges of the paying agent for paying principal and interest. 
                  The use and disposition of such sinking fund shall be subject to such regulations as may be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, but, except as may otherwise be provided in such resolution or trust indenture, such sinking fund shall be maintained as a trust account for the benefit of all revenue bonds without distinction or priority of one over another. 
                  Sec. 17. - Remedies of bondholders. 
                  Any holder of revenue bonds or any of the coupons appertaining thereto and the trustee under the trust indenture, if any, except to the extent the rights given in this Act, may be restricted by resolution passed before the issuance of the revenue bonds, or by the trust indenture, may, either at law or in equity, by suit, action, mandamus, or other proceedings, protect and enforce any and all rights under the laws of the state, including specifically, but without limitation, the Revenue Bond Law, or granted under this Act or under such resolution or trust indenture, and may enforce and compel performance of all duties required by this Act or by such resolution or trust indenture to be performed by the authority or any officer thereof, including the fixing, charging, and collecting of revenues, fees, tolls, fines, and other charges for the use of the facilities and services furnished.

Such defendant shall be required to show cause, if any exists, why such contract or contracts shall not be adjudicated as a part of the basis for the security for the payment of any such revenue bonds. The revenue bonds, when validated, and the judgment of validation shall be final and conclusive with respect to such revenue bonds and the security for the payment thereof and interest thereon and against the authority and all other defendants. 
                  Sec. 19. - Venue and jurisdiction.

If an employee sustains an injury while engaged in outside employment, but is performing duties, within the scope of his city responsibilities (i.e., a police arrest), he may be eligible for partial city worker's compensation benefits. 
                  (e)  Failure to comply with the provisions of this section will result in disciplinary action.

                  Sec. 6-15. - Types of entertainment, attire and conduct prohibited. 
                  (a)  Purpose. 
                  (1)  Based upon the experiences of other counties and municipalities, including but not limited to Atlanta and Fulton County, Georgia; DeKalb County, Georgia; Gwinnett County, Georgia; Austin, Texas; Seattle and Renton, Washington; New York, New York; Los Angeles, California; and Fort Lauderdale and Palm Beach, Florida; which experiences the city council believes are relevant to the problems faced by the city and based upon the evidence and testimony of the citizens and experts who have appeared before such bodies, the city council takes notice of the notorious and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities. 
                  (2)  Moreover, it is the finding of the city council that public nudity and seminudity, under certain circumstances, particular circumstances relating to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in so-called "nude bars" or establishments offering so-called "nude entertainment," "adult entertainment" or "erotic entertainment" begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with nudity and alcohol are disorderly conduct, prostitution, and drug trafficking and use. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with nudity and alcohol are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhoods, increased expenditure for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described, and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas. Therefore, the limitation of nude or seminude conduct in establishments licensed to sell alcohol for consumption on the premises is in the public welfare and is a matter of governmental interest and concern to prevent the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which serve alcohol and also allow and/or encourage nudity or seminudity.

                  Sec. 6-16. - Gambling devices prohibited. 
                  (a)  The mayor and city council find that the regulation of certain amusement machines, namely gambling devices, in establishments that sell alcoholic beverages is in furtherance of the health, safety, and welfare on the inhabitants of the city. Further, the mayor and the city council find that such devices in these establishments lead to loitering, crowds, unruly behavior, and place demands on law enforcement, and have other adverse secondary effects and unintended consequences and that this regulation is the reasonable means to achieve the city's interests. As used in this section, the term "gambling device" shall have the same meaning as set forth in O.C.G.A. § 16-12-20(2). Notwithstanding the foregoing, said term does not include vending machines that do not incorporate recreational features, kiddie rides, newspaper stands, telephones, cigarette vending machines, or jukeboxes.

A finding by a court of competent jurisdiction that any tenant on the subject premises for which a license under this article is originally issued violated subsection (b) of this section shall create a rebuttable presumption that the licensee landlord failed to take reasonably appropriate measures under this subsection. 
                  (d)  Upon a first violation of subsection (b) or (c) of this section, the licensee's license under this chapter shall be suspended for no less than three and no more than six months. Upon a second violation of this section, the licensee's license under this chapter shall be revoked. 
                  (e)  In the case of multiple gambling devices, each respective gambling device shall be considered a separate violation under this section; moreover, it shall be considered a separate violation under this section each day an individual prohibited gambling device remains on the subject premises for which a license under this chapter is issued.

                  (a)  No license for the sale of alcoholic beverages shall be granted to any person who is not a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence. 
                  (b)  Where the applicant is a partnership or corporation, the provisions of this section shall apply to all its partners, officer, and majority stockholders. In the case of a corporation, the license shall be issued jointly to the corporation and the majority stockholder, if an individual. Where the majority stockholder is not an individual, the license shall be issued jointly to the corporation and its agent registered under the provisions of this chapter. In the case of a partnership, the license will be issued to all the partners owning at least 20 percent of the partnership. If no partner owns 20 percent of the partnership, then the general partner, managing partner, or the partner with the greatest percentage ownership will be licensed. 
                  (c)  No person, firm or corporation shall be granted any alcoholic beverage license unless it shall appear to the satisfaction of the city clerk or his designee that such person, partners in the firm, officer and directors of the corporation have not been convicted or plead guilty or entered a plea of nolo contendere, and have been released from parole or probation, to any crime involving moral turpitude, illegal gambling or illegal possession or sale of controlled substances or the illegal possession or sale of alcoholic beverages, including the sale or transfer or sale of alcoholic beverages to minors in a manner contrary to law, keeping a place of prostitution, pandering, pimping, public indecency, prostitution, solicitation of sodomy, or any sex related crime within a period of ten years immediately prior to the filing of such application. At the time an application is submitted for any alcoholic beverage license, the applicant shall, by a duly sworn affidavit, certify that neither the applicant, nor any of the other owners of the establishment has been convicted or has pleaded guilty or entered a plea of nolo contendere, and has been released from parole or probation, to any crime involving moral turpitude, illegal gambling or illegal possession or sale of controlled substances or the illegal possession or sale of alcoholic beverages, including the sale or transfer of alcoholic beverages to minors in a manner contrary to law, keeping a place of prostitution, pandering, pimping, public indecency, prostitution, solicitation of sodomy, or any sex related crime within a period of ten years immediately prior to the filing of such application. An applicant's first time conviction for illegal possession of alcohol as a misdemeanor or violation of a county or municipal ordinance shall not, by itself, make an applicant ineligible for an alcoholic license. Should any applicant, partner, or officer used in the sale or dispensing of any alcoholic beverage, after a license has been granted, be convicted or plead guilty or nolo contendere to a crime involving moral turpitude, illegal gambling or illegal possession or sale of controlled substances or the illegal possession or sale of alcoholic beverages, including the sale or transfer or alcoholic beverages to minors in a manner contrary to law, keeping a place of prostitution, pandering, pimping, public indecency, prostitution, solicitation of sodomy, or any sex related crime, the license shall be immediately revoked and canceled.

                  (g)  All licensed establishments must have and continuously maintain in the city or in the county a registered agent upon whom any process, notice or demand required or permitted by law or under this chapter to be served upon the licensee or owner may be served. This person must be a resident of the city or of the county. The licensee shall file such forms as required by the city clerk to provide the name of such agent and the consent of such agent to serve in such capacity. Additionally, the registered agent shall provide a release permitting the police department to perform an investigation to verify his residency. 
                  (h)  A license application may be denied to any applicant for any alcoholic beverage license where it appears that the applicant would not have adequate financial participation in the proposed business to direct and manage its affairs, or where it appears that the application is intended to be a mere surrogate for a person who would not otherwise quality for a license for any reason whatsoever. 
                  (i)  The city clerk, in his discretion, may consider any extenuating circumstances that may reflect favorably or unfavorably on the applicant, the application, or the proposed location of the business. If, in his judgment, circumstances are such that the granting of the license would not be in the best interest of the general public, such circumstances may be grounds for denying the application. 
                  (j)  For purposes of this section, a conviction or plea of guilty or nolo contendere shall be ignored as to any offense for which the defendant was allowed to avail themselves of the Georgia First Offender Act (O.C.G.A. § 42-8-60 et seq.). Except, however, that any such offense shall not be ignored where the defendant violated any term or probation imposed by the court granting first offender treatment or committed another crime and the sentencing court entered an adjudication of guilt as to the crime for which the defendant had previously been sentenced as a first offender.

                  No alcoholic beverage license shall be issued to any person unless the building in which the business will be located is complete and detailed plans of said building and outside premises are attached to the application or unless proposed plans and specifications and a building permit of a proposed building to be built are attached to the application. The completed building or the proposed building shall comply with ordinances of the city, regulations for the state revenue commissioner, and the state. The proposed building shall also be subject to final inspection and approval when completed by the building inspector. Each building in which the business will be located shall contain sufficient lighting so that the building itself and the premises on all sides of the building are readily visible at all times from the front of the street on which the building is located so as to reveal all of the outside premises of such building. Each applicant for an alcoholic beverage license shall attach to the application evidence of ownership of the building or proposed building or a copy of the lease if the applicant is leasing the building. If the applicant is a franchisee, then such applicant shall attach a copy of the franchise agreement or contract with the application.

                  (b)  The school building referred to in this section shall apply only to state, county, city, or church school buildings and to such buildings at such other schools in which are taught subjects commonly taught in the common schools and colleges of this state. The term "school building" includes only those structures in which instruction is offered. 
                  (c)  The term "church building," as used in this section, means the main structure used by any religious organization for purposes of worship.

                  (e)  No location which is licensed to sell alcoholic beverages on the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived shall be denied continued operation under an existing license, or denied any renewal of such license, nor shall any new owner of said location be denied a new license based upon the measurements set forth in this section. 
                  (f)  As to any location licensed in the future, if the distance requirements of this section are met at the time of issuance of any license, the subsequent opening and operation of a church or school within the distance prohibited herein shall not prevent the continuance of an existing license or the renewal thereof or the issuance of a new license to any subsequent owner of such property.

                  (c)  In the event that a license is surrendered, or a licensee severs his association with a licensed establishment, the establishment may continue to sell alcoholic beverages for a period of 45 days from date of surrender, or from the date determined by the city clerk to the date of severance; provided no such sale shall be authorized until such time as a new application for a license is made, said application indicating that no change of ownership has occurred, except as excepted herein.

                  (a)  A license issued pursuant to this chapter may be suspended or revoked by the city clerk where the licensee furnishes fraudulent or untruthful information in the application for a license and for failure to pay all fees, taxes, or other charges imposed under the provisions of this chapter. 
                  (b)  Whenever the state shall revoke any permit or license to sell alcoholic beverages, the city license shall thereupon be automatically revoked.

                  (g)  An act or omission of a licensee, owner of more than 20 percent interest in the licensed establishment, or employee of the licensee or licensed establishment willingly or knowingly performed, which constitutes a violation of federal or state law or of any provision of this chapter will subject the licensee to suspension or revocation of its license in accordance with the provisions of this section, when the city clerk determines to his own satisfaction that the act or omission did occur, regardless of whether any criminal prosecution or conviction ensues; provided, however, in the case of an employee, the city clerk or his designee must determine that the acts of the employee were known to or under reasonable circumstances should have been known to the licensee, were condoned by the licensee, or where the licensee has not established practices or procedures to prevent the violation from occurring. 
                  (h)  Whenever it can be shown that a licensee under this chapter no longer maintains adequate financial responsibility upon which issuance of the license was conditioned or whenever the licensee has default in any obligation of any kind whatsoever, lawfully owning to the city, the city clerk shall suspend or revoke the license. 
                  (i)  Wherever this chapter permits the city clerk may spend any license issued hereunder but does not mandate the period of such suspension, such discretion shall be exercised within the guidelines of this subsection.

                  (b)  The city clerk shall provide written notice to the applicant or licensee of his order to deny, suspend or revoke the license. Such written notification shall set forth in reasonable detail the reasons for such actions and shall notify the application or licensee of the right to appeal under the provisions of this chapter. Any applicant or licensee who is aggrieved or adversely affected by a final action of the city clerk may have a review thereof by appeal to the alcohol license and permit appeal board. Such appeal shall be by written petition, filed in the office of the city clerk within 15 days after the final order or action of the city clerk and in order to defray administrative costs, must be accompanied by a filing fee as set forth in the fee schedule in chapter 22; except that the filing fee for appeals relating only to pouring permits for employees shall be as set forth in the fee schedule in chapter 22. The city clerk, at his discretion, may waive or reduce the filing fee amount if it is determined that the fee would create a hardship on the individual filing said appeal. The alcohol license and permit appeal board may, at the request of the appellant, refund the filing fee by a majority vote. 
                  (c)  The alcohol license and permit appeal board shall consist of five members and shall determine all issues by a majority vote. The board shall select one of its members as chairperson. Should the alcohol license and permit appeal board be unable to reach a decision by majority vote, the action taken by the city clerk shall be upheld automatically. Any three members constitutes a quorum. The members shall be named by the city council. The terms of the members of the alcohol license and permit appeal board shall be set by the appointing body. The members of the alcohol license and permit appeal board who are city employees shall not receive additional compensation for their service on that board. Non-city employees on the alcohol license and permit appeal board shall be compensated as set forth in the fee schedule in chapter 22 for their services. 
                  (d)  A hearing shall be conducted on each appeal within 30 days of the date of filing with the city clerk unless a continuance of such date is agreed to by the appellant and the city clerk. The appellant at such hearing shall have the right to be represented by an attorney, at the expense of the appellant, and to present evidence and cross examine witnesses. Should the appellant desire an official transcript of the appeal proceedings, then such request must be made at least three days prior to such hearing. The appellant shall have the burden of proof on any such appeal. Before hearing an appeal, each member of the alcohol license and permit appeal board shall sign an affidavit to be part of the record that he is not related to or personal friends with any owner of the licensed establishment in question in the appeal being considered and that he has no financial interest in the outcome of the appeal. Should any member be unable to sign such an affidavit, that member shall not serve on that appeal and the case shall be heard by the remaining members of the alcohol license and permit appeal board. 
                  (e)  The findings of the alcohol license and permit appeal board shall be forwarded to the city clerk within 15 days after the conclusion of the hearing, and it shall be the duty of the city clerk to notify the appellant of the action of the alcohol license and permit appeal board. 
                  (f)  The findings of the alcohol license and permit appeal board shall not be set aside unless found to be: 
                  (1)  Contrary to law or ordinances; 
                  (2)  Unsupported by substantial evidence on the records as a whole; or 
                  (3)  Unreasonable. 
                  (g)  The findings of the alcohol license and permit appeal board shall be final unless appealed within 30 days of the date of said finding by certiorari to the superior court of the county.

                  (Ord. of 12-13-1999, § 1-1056) 
                  Sec. 6-154. - Regulations as to employees and managers. 
                  The following regulations shall apply to all establishments holding a license for consumption of alcoholic beverages on the premises: 
                  (1)  No person shall be employed to dispense, sell, serve, take orders, mix alcoholic beverages, or in any managerial position, by an establishment holding a license hereunder until such person has been fingerprinted or cleared by the chief of police or his designee, indicating that the person is eligible for such permit. 
                  (2)  This section shall not be construed to include employees whose duties are limited solely to those of busboys, cooks, or dishwashers. 
                  (3)  No permit shall be issued until such time as a signed application has been filed with the city police department, chief of police or his designee, and upon paying a fee, which shall be established by the city council, and a search of the criminal record of the person completed. Said application shall include, but shall not be limited to, the name, date of birth, and prior arrest record of the person though the fact of an arrest record shall be used for investigative purposes only, and shall give rise to no presumption or inference of guilt. Due to the inclusion of arrest information, these applications shall be regarded as confidential and shall not be produced for public inspection without a court order. 
                  (4)  The chief of police or his designee shall have a complete and exhaustive search made relative to any police record of the person fingerprinted or cleared. In the event there is no record of a violation of this article, the chief of police or his designee shall issue a permit to the person, by mail, stating that the person is eligible for employment. If it is found that the person is not eligible for employment, the chief of police or his designee shall notify the person, in writing, that they are not eligible for employment, the case of such denial and their right to appeal. 
                  (5)  No person shall be granted a pouring permit unless it appears to the satisfaction of the chief of police or his designee, that such person has not been convicted or plead guilty or entered a plea of nolo contendere to any crime involving moral turpitude, illegal gambling, or illegal possession or sale of controlled substances or the illegal sale or possession of alcoholic beverages, including the sale or transfer of alcoholic beverages to minors in a manner contrary to law, keeping a place of prostitution, pandering, pimping, public indecency, prostitution, solicitation or sodomy, or any sex related crime within a period of five years of the date of conviction and has been released from parole or probation. A person's first time conviction for illegal possession of alcohol as a misdemeanor or violation of a county ordinance shall not, by itself, make a person ineligible for an alcohol pouring permit. 
                  (6)  No person shall be granted a pouring permit who has been convicted, plead guilty or entered a plea of nolo contendere to any federal, state, or local law for any felony within five years of the date of conviction and has not been released from parole or probation prior to the filing for application for such permit. 
                  (7)  For purposes of this section, a conviction or plea of guilt or nolo contendere shall be ignored as to any offense for which the defendant was allowed to avail themselves of the Georgia First Offender Act (O.C.G.A. § 42-8-60 et seq.); except, however, that any such offense shall not be ignored where the defendant violated any term of probation imposed by the court granting first offender treatment or committed another crime and the sentence in court entered an adjudication of guilt as to the crime for which the defendant had previously been sentenced as a first offender. 
                  (8)  An alcohol pouring permit shall not be issued for a period of one calendar year from the date of the original application. As noted in subsection (14) of this section, the alcohol pouring permit must be in the possession of the employee while the employee is working at the licensed establishment. This permit must be in the possession of the employee while the pouring permit holder is working and available for inspection by members of the city police department or the city clerk. 
                  (9)  No person shall be issued a permit if it is determined that the person falsified, concealed, or covered up any material fact by any device, trick or scheme while making application to the police department for an alcoholic beverage pouring permit under this section. 
                  (10)  If it is determined that a person is in violation of this section and a permit is denied for this reason, then 30 calendar days must elapse from date of notification per certified mailing before a new application and fee may be resubmitted. 
                  (11)  All permits issued through administrative error can be terminated and seized by the chief of police or his designee, or the city clerk or his designee. 
                  (12)  Replacement permits will be issued within 30 days of original date, upon paying one-half of the fee charged for alcohol pouring permits. After 30 days of original application date, a new application and fee must be submitted. 
                  (13)  All permits issued hereunder remain the property of the city police department, and shall be produced for inspection upon the demand of any officer or designee of the city police department or employee of the business license department. 
                  (14)  No license shall allow any employee or manager required to hold a permit to work on the premises unless the employee or manager has in his possession a current valid city pouring permit. For new employees, a receipt issued by the city police permit unit may be used for a maximum of 30 days from date of its issue. Licensees are required by this section to inspect and verify that each employee required to do so has in such employee's possession a valid current alcohol pouring permit. 
                  (15)  It shall be the duty of all persons holding any license to sell alcoholic beverages to file with the chief of police or his designee, the name of the establishment, the license number and a list of all employees, with their home address and home telephone numbers twice annually; during the month of June and again during the month of December. 
                  (16)  Any person convicted of any violation of this section shall receive a minimum fine of $200.00.

                  (a)  Alcoholic beverage sales can be made by a licensed consumption on-premises establishment in a patio/open area type environment if the establishment has been approved to do so by the city clerk. 
                  (b)  The requirement for approval is that the patio/open area be enclosed by some structure providing for public ingress/egress only through the main licensed premises. The purpose of this requirement is to prevent a customer from leaving the outside sales area with an open drink within the licensee's knowledge. 
                  (c)  The height of such structure shall be a minimum of 3.5 feet above ground level. It does not have to be solid nor does it have to restrict visibility into or out of the patio/open sales area. The structure must be permitted and approved by the city's building inspection department and the city's fire department as required by their governing regulations or codes. 
                  (d)  The only exit from this type area is to be through the licensed establishment's main premises and through an approved fire exit (not for general public use unless an emergency exists). The fire exit should be of the type that sounds an alarm so that the establishment will be alerted in the event of unauthorized use when no emergency exists. 
                  (e)  In the event that a licensee desires a patio/open sales area inside an existing structure, plans will be reviewed and approved on an individual basis by the city clerk. Interior-type patio/open sales areas must also meet the requirements of the city's development and fire codes. 
                  (f)  Nothing contained in this section shall prohibit a hotel or motel with a consumption on the premises license from making such sales and allowing consumption of alcoholic beverages in ballrooms, meeting rooms, reception rooms, or patio areas of such hotel or motel; provided such functions are catered in connection with a meeting, conference, convention or similar type gathering at such hotel or motel. The term "patio areas," as that term is used in this subsection, does not have to conform to the standards in this section.

If the application is denied and the license refused, or if the applicant withdraws his application prior to its being issued, the license fee shall be refunded; but the $300.00 cost paid for investigation shall be retained. However, any person applying for more than one license shall pay only one fee to defray investigative and administrative expenses, which fee shall be the largest of the investigative and administrative fees authorized under this Code.

The interested parties shall have the right to file an answer to the complaint and to appear in person or by attorney and offer testimony at the time and place fixed for hearing. 
                  (e)  If, after such notice and hearing, the court determines that the dwelling, building, or structure in question is unfit for human habitation or is unfit for its current commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the court shall state in writing findings of fact in support of such determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the interested parties that have answered the complaint or appeared at the hearing an order: 
                  (1)  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter, or improve such dwelling, building, or structure so as to bring it into full compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violation and, if applicable, to secure the structure so that it cannot be used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or 
                  (2)  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure in order to bring it into full compliance with applicable codes relevant to the cited violations cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to demolish and remove such dwelling, building, or structure and all debris from the property. 
                  (3)  For purposes of this subsection, the court shall make its determination of "reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure" without consideration of the value of the land on which the structure is situated; provided, however, that costs of the preparation necessary to repair, alter, or improve a structure may be considered. Income and financial status of the owner shall not be factor in the court's determination. The present value of the structure and the costs of repair, alteration, or improvement may be established by affidavits of real estate appraisers with a Georgia appraiser classification as provided in O.C.G.A. ch. 39A of tit. 43, qualified building contractors, or qualified building inspectors without actual testimony presented. Costs of repair, alteration, or improvement of the structure shall be the cost necessary to bring the structure into compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violations in force in the jurisdiction. 
                  (f)  If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair or demolish the dwelling, building, or structure, the code official may cause such dwelling, building, or structure to be repaired, altered, or improved or to be vacated and closed or demolished. Such abatement action shall commence within 270 days after the expiration of time specified in the order for abatement by the owner. Any time during which such action is prohibited by a court order issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 41-2-13 or any other equitable relief granted by a court of competent jurisdiction shall not be counted toward the 270 days in which such abatement action must commence. The code official shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of the building, dwelling, or structure a placard with the following words: "This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business use and does not comply with the applicable codes or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with drug crimes or constitutes an endangerment to public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful." 
                  (g)  If the code official has the structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any moneys received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. The code official and governing authority are relieved of any and all liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials. 
                  (h)  The amount of the cost of demolition, including all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the city tax commissioner or municipal tax collector or city revenue officer, and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, including restoration to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred. 
                  (i)  Nothing in this section shall be construed to impair or limit in any way the power of the city to define and declare nuisances and to cause their removal or abatement by summary proceedings or otherwise.

               <p>
                  Sec. 16-1. - Wrecker services. 
                  (a)  The city manager shall approve the primary wrecker services to be used by the city police, fire, and street departments. These wrecker services shall have the following qualifications: 
                  (1)  Possess a valid City of Jefferson Business License. 
                  (2)  Be insured for at least $500,000.00 for the wrecker business. 
                  (3)  Have a secure lot for storage of all stored vehicles, which must screen the contents of the secured lot from view. The method of screening shall be as approved by the city manager or designee. The general design standard is that all screening must be 80 percent opaque or higher, as interpreted by the city manager or designee. Existing wrecker services with chain-link fences surrounding their secured storage lot may meet the screening requirement with one or more of the means specified in this paragraph. When a new chain-link fence is established for purposes of meeting the requirements of this Code section, it shall be vinyl-coated as required by the Land Use Management Code. 
                  a.  The installation of slats (long pieces of aluminum, polyethylene, plastic vertical tubing, or other material) that are inserted into the fence vertically, horizontally, or diagonally is permissible, provided that they are a neutral color, and provided they allow for no more than ½ inch wide openings between slats. "Wing" slats which have wing portions positioned on each side of the slats, are preferred in order to maximize opacity and/or to meet the 80 percent opacity screening standard. 
                  b.  Fabric providing the requiring opacity may also be used. 
                  c.  The city manager or designee may require submission of screening fence details by the applicant in order to ensure the requirements of this paragraph are met; or the city manager or designee may conduct a field inspection prior to certifying that a wrecker service provider has met this requirement. 
                  (4)  Have a physical address and vehicle storage lot within the county limits of Jackson County. 
                  (5)  Maintain a daily wrecker log of all calls for service. 
                  (6)  Maintain a road worthy tow vehicle complete with working amber emergency and signal lights that illuminate according to D.O.T. regulations. 
                  (7)  Be available for service calls 24 hours a day. 
                  a.  Be available to respond to scene within 30 minutes of call out. 
                  (8)  Be able to adhere to all state and local regulations regarding the clean-up of debris from accident scenes. 
                  (9)  Maintain a valid Georgia Driver's License at all times. 
                  (10)  Be available for a compliance inspection from the Jefferson Police Department to include validating the wreckers daily log, safety compliance of the wrecker itself and an inspection of all storage facilities. 
                  (11)  Be certified by the Georgia Public Service Commission, Transportation Division and granted authority from this agency to operate a wrecker service. The wrecker must have a painted or stenciled sign in a permanent manner, except vehicles being operated under lease for less than 30 days, with the information on both sides of the cab or body as required by the Commissioners Transportation Rule Numbers 1-7- 1.02(d) and/or 1-7-1.02(k) stating the identification of the wrecker(s). 
                  (12)  Possess a valid motor carrier of property permit granted by the Georgia Public Service Commission. 
                  (13)  Possess a valid intrastate registration permit granted by the Georgia Public Safety Commission. 
                  (14)  Possess a current motor carrier medical examiners certificate. 
                  (b)  Because of the inherent dangers and special needs associated with "heavy lift" wreckers (tow trucks capable of towing articulated vehicles, vehicles over 10,000 pounds or hazardous materials), the city reserves the right to use whatever wrecker service it deems capable of successfully hauling these special need vehicles to a safe storage or impound area, whether these towing companies are located within the city or not, and hereby wave the requirements for these types of wreckers as stated in subsection (a) above. 
                  (c)  The City of Jefferson Police Department shall operate its own "impound lot" at the discretion of the chief of police. This lot shall hold vehicles impounded as part of accident investigations, criminal investigations, vehicles with no insurance, vehicles with defective equipment which are not road worthy and any other vehicles deemed necessary to seize for long or short periods of time as mandated by Georgia Law. 
                  (d)  All wrecker services wishing to be included in the wrecker rotation that meet the requirements as outlined above shall submit a written application (obtainable at the Jefferson Police Department) to the Chief of Police of Jefferson, Georgia. The chief of police or his designee shall insure that the requirements for operating in Jackson County as a "list" wrecker for the city public safety agencies are met and he/she will be responsible for forwarding this application to the city manager for approval. 
                  (e)  All wrecker services approved by the Jefferson City Manager and/or chief of police as a "list" wrecker for the public safety agencies shall be notified in writing that their application was accepted. Those wrecker services that are not approved by the city manager and chief of police shall also be notified in writing to this fact. The application shall be valid for the entire calendar year (January 1 through December 31). Each calendar year each wrecker service must be inspected by the Jefferson Police Department as to compliance to the terms of this section. 
                  (f)  City manager and/or chief of police reserves the right to disqualify any wrecker service for the lack of and/or poor performance.

                  (a)  Except as otherwise provided in this article or state law, the city clerk (ex-officio treasurer, tax receiver, tax collector) shall be charged with the duty to administer the imposition, collection and enforcement of all taxes and special assessments levied or imposed by the city in accordance with the administrative procedures hereinafter set forth. To the extent this article fails to provide a designated procedure, said officer shall act in the manner established, if any, for county tax collectors under applicable state law. 
                  (b)  The city clerk shall cause a bill to be sent to all taxpayers at the address last shown on the county tax digest by regular United States mail, with adequate postage thereon; provided, however, failure by the taxpayer to receive a bill shall not constitute grounds for nonpayment or late payment of the tax. The bill shall state the location or description of the property taxed, the fair market value of the property (100 percent) and its taxable value (40 percent of fair market value), and the amount of tax due thereon. The bill shall also state the due date after which taxes shall be in default. The bill may also contain such additional information as allowed by law or authorized by the mayor and council.

                  Sec. 30-20. - Due date; payment; interest on past due taxes. 
                  (a)  All ad valorem taxes shall be due and payable in full within 60 days after notice, unless the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, in which case it shall be postponed until the first day following which is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. Supplemental ad valorem taxes and special assessments shall be due and payable on the date set forth in the ordinance imposing the tax or assessment. 
                  (b)  All taxes and assessments imposed by the city shall be paid in full in legal tender of the United States; except where specially authorized by law or ordinance of the mayor and council, no partial payments shall be accepted. 
                  (c)  Special assessments shall bear interest at the rate of one percent per month from the date the assessment is due until the date the assessment is paid. For purposes of this section, any period of less than one month shall be considered to be one full month. The city clerk may waive the collection of any interest, in whole or in part, due the city on unpaid taxes or assessments whenever or to the extent that he reasonably determines that the delay in payment was attributable to the action or inaction of his department.

The proceedings to collect the original tax, the tax constituted from penalties imposed, and the interest shall all be conducted in the same manner. Any provision of law for criminal prosecution shall not operate to relieve any taxpayer of any tax, penalty, or interest imposed by this article. 
                  (b)  In any instance in which any taxpayer fails to pay a tax or assessment within 90 days of the due date, he shall pay a penalty of ten percent of the amount of the tax due, together with interest as specified herein. 
                  (c)  The mayor and council may waive, in whole or in part, the collection of any amount due as a penalty under this article to the extent said body finds and determines the default giving rise to the penalty was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect or disregard of this article.

                  Sec. 30-22. - Executions on delinquent taxes and assessments. 
                  (a)  As soon as the last day for the payment of taxes and assessments has arrived, the city clerk shall notify in writing the taxpayer of the fact that the taxes have not been paid and that, unless paid within 30 days, an execution shall be issued. 
                  (b)  The city clerk shall issue executions for the nonpayment of taxes and assessments at any time after 30 days have elapsed since giving notice as provided in subsection (a) of this section. The execution shall identify the defendant in fi. fa. (taxpayer), the years for which delinquent taxes are being executed, and the amount thereof. Executions shall be directed to "all and singular sheriffs and constables of the state." 
                  (c)  The city clerk shall cause all execution issued to be recorded on the general execution docket of the county where the property is located, in the case of real property, and, in the case of personal property, in the county of the taxpayer's residence if a resident of the state, otherwise in the county where any real or personal property of the taxpayer may be bound. If the taxpayer is not a resident of the state and has no known real or personal property within the state, the execution shall be recorded in the county in which the act or activity giving rise to tax liability took place. 
                  (d)  All execution issued shall continue to bear interest and penalties at the rates established in this article for past due taxes and assessments. 
                  (e)  The city clerk shall cause all executions issued to be placed in the hands of the city marshal for collection or levy and sale of property. The marshal shall exercise his best efforts to collect the full amount of taxes and assessments due, together with all interest, penalties, and any costs due thereon, from the defendant in fi. fa. In the event he is unable to do so, the marshal shall levy the execution on a sufficient amount of the defendant in fi. fa.'s property, whether real or personal, to satisfy the obligations due at a sale to be held and conducted in accordance with this article.

                  Sec. 30-23. - Levy of executions; sale of property. 
                  (a)  The chief of police is hereby designated as the marshal of the city and delegated the duties set forth in this article. The marshal shall be subject to being ruled for money in his hands arising from the public sale of any property pursuant to proceed issued by the municipality. After first paying the city clerk the amount due on the process under which the sale was made, the marshal shall pay any surplus to any lawful claimant holding an interest subordinate to the lien for taxes, else to the defendant in fi. fa. 
                  (b)  In all cases of levying on real property, within five days written notice of the levy must be given personally, or delivered by certified mail, to the defendant in fi. fa. and to any tenants in possession. If the land is unoccupied, a copy of the notice of levy shall also be conspicuously posted on the land. In the case of personal property, the marshal shall enter the same on the execution and plainly describe the property levied on and the amount of the interest of the defendant in fi. fa. therein. 
                  (c)  Whenever any real property is levied upon for taxes for assessments, it shall be the marshal's duty before proceeding to advertise the property for sale to give 20 day's written notice of the levy to the record owner of the property and the holder of each security deed of record. The 20-day period shall begin to run from the time the notice is personally delivered or, when delivered by registered or certified mail with return receipt requested, from the date of mailing. The notice shall contain a description of the land levied upon, the name of the owner of the land, the year or years for which the taxes were assessed, and a statement of the amount of the taxes due, together with accrued costs. The marshal shall keep a copy of the notice on which he shall enter the date the notice was delivered or mailed and how, where, and to whom the notice was delivered. The marshal shall file this copy with the city clerk. 
                  (d)  When a levy is made upon real or personal property, the property shall be advertised and sold by the marshal in the same manner as provided for executions and judicial sales; provided, however, in addition to such other notice as may be required by law, the defendant in fi. fa. shall be given at least ten days written notice of such sale by registered or certified mail. The notice shall be addressed to the taxpayer at the last known address listed in the records of the county tax commissioner. In addition, if the United States has a claim or lien on the property subject to being sold and such lien was filed or recorded more than 30 days before the proposed sale, the marshal shall cause written notice of the sale to be given to the secretary of the treasury or his delegate not less than 25 days before the sale. Notice may be given either by personal service or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested. 
                  (e)  The marshal shall publish weekly for four weeks in the official legal organ of the county in which the sale will be conducted an advertisement of the date, place, and hours during which the sale will be conducted, together with a full and complete description of the property to be sold, making known the names of the owners of record and any person who may be in possession of the property. The notice shall state the property is being sold for collection of taxes due to the city and the years for which taxes have been executed. 
                  (f)  Sales of property under execution shall be made by the marshal before the city hall on the first Tuesday in each month between the hours of 10:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. eastern standard time or eastern daylight savings time, whichever is applicable, and at public outcry to the highest bidder for cash; provided, however, should the first Tuesday or the month fall on New Year's Day or Independence Day, such sales shall take place on the immediately following Wednesday. The purchaser shall look for himself as to the title and soundness of all property sold under tax executions and neither the marshal conducting the sale, nor the city, make any representations or warranty of title, condition, or fitness for a particular purpose, expressed or implied. 
                  (g)  The marshal shall sell the property to the highest bidder for cash and upon collection of the sales price, make a deed or bill of sale to the purchaser. Any person who becomes the purchaser of any property sold at the sale, who fails or refuses to comply with the term of sale when requested by the marshal to do so, shall be liable for the amount of the purchase money. It shall be the option of the marshal either to proceed against the purchaser for the full amount of the purchase money or to resell the property and then proceed against the first purchaser for any deficiency. A tax deed for real property, or bill of sale for personal property, made and delivered as evidence of sale for taxes conducted pursuant to this section shall convey the title as effectually as if the sale were made by the person against whom the process was issued. Sales of personal property shall be final; real property sold by virtue of an execution issued for the collection of taxes or for any special assessments is subject to redemption rights of the defendant in fi. fa. or any person having any right, title, or interest in or lien upon such property at the time of levy and sale. Recitals in a deed or bill of sale under power of sale for taxes shall be prima facie evidence of the facts recited in the instrument. The marshal shall put the purchaser in possession of the property so sold; provided, however, the purchaser of real property is not entitled to be placed in possession until after the time for redemption has expired. 
                  (h)  Whenever no bids are forthcoming on property sold for taxes after the property has been offered a reasonable time the marshal may either re-advertise and sell the property at a later date or abandon the property. The marshal shall make a proper notation on the execution whenever property levied upon and exposed for sale has been abandoned due to lack of bids.

                  Sec. 30-24. - Bidding by city at tax sales; disposition of property acquired. 
                  (a)  If, during any sale of property for taxes and after the property has been offered a reasonable time, no one present at the sale bids an amount for the property being sold which is as much as the total of the taxes due (including any priority liens for taxes due the state, county, and school and other special tax districts of the state) plus the marshal's cost due on the sale, then the city manager, or his designee, may purchase the property for the city. If the city purchases property at a sale, the marshal shall make to the city a deed to the property sold and shall deliver the deed to the city manager. The marshal shall put the city in possession of the property so sold. 
                  (b)  Property acquired by the city pursuant to a sale for taxes or assessment may be divested or alienated by the city only by public sale of the property to the highest bidder; however, when the city has not parted with title to the property, the city may quitclaim the property to the owner at the time of the tax sale, or to the owner's administrators, executors, heirs, or assigns, upon full payment of the redemption price provided in section 30-27. 
                  (c)  The right of redemption in real property purchased by the city at a tax sale shall be foreclosed in the manner set forth in section 30-27.

                  Sec. 30-25. - Accounting by marshal; final return or settlement. 
                  (a)  The marshal shall make a prompt accounting to the city clerk for all executions placed in his hands for collection or levy and sale. He shall pay over to the clerk all amounts due to the city for taxes and assessments, interest, penalties, and costs, and shall file a final written return or settlement showing the amounts so paid, together with disposition of the excess proceeds derived from the sale. If there is any excess after paying taxes, costs, and all expenses of a sale, it shall be immediately paid to the person authorized to receive the excess. 
                  (b)  In any event, within 90 days from the date executions are placed in his hands, if the marshal finds an execution to be either uncollectible or not collectable in full, he shall so notify the city clerk in writing. It shall be the duty of the clerk to cause cancellation of executions on the general execution docket for the county upon their final payment or collection. 
                  (Ord. of 4-8-1996, § 1-7) 
                  Sec. 30-26. - Garnishments by city; reduction of executions to judgment. 
                  (a)  Whenever the marshal can find no property belonging to a defendant in fi. fa. on which to levy any tax execution in his hands, he shall make an entry to that effect on the execution. The city clerk, in the name of the city, may then petition any court of competent jurisdiction to issue a summons of garnishment against any person whom he believes to be indebted to the defendant in fi. fa. or who has property, money, or effects in his hands belonging to the defendant in fi. fa. The clerk shall enter upon the execution the names of the persons garnished and the court and file number of the action where the garnishment is filed. All subsequent proceedings shall be the same as provided by law in other cases where judgments have been obtained or execution is issued. 
                  (b)  When an execution for taxes remains unsatisfied and an entry of nulla bona has been duly entered by the marshal on the execution within the immediately preceding 30-day period and the city clerk has reason to believe the defendant in fi. fa. may have or may come into ownership of assets outside the state, the clerk, in the name of the city, may petition the superior court of the county in this state in which the defendant in fi. fa. maintains a known residence, place of business, or agent to receive service, to reduce the execution to judgment. If the defendant in fi. fa. does not maintain known residence in this state, the action may be brought in the county where the tax obligation arose. This and all subsequent proceedings shall be brought in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 48-3-1 et seq. 
                  (Ord. of 4-8-1996, § 1-8) 
                  Sec. 30-27. - Redemption rights of defendant in fi. fa.; vesting of title in grantee. 
                  (a)  Whenever real property is sold for taxes for any special assessment, the defendant in fi. fa. or any person having any right, title, or interest in or lien upon such property may redeem the property from the sale by the payment of the redemption price or the amount required for redemption as fixed by O.C.G.A. § 48-5-42, at any time within 12 months from the date of sale, and at any time after the sale until the right to redeem is foreclosed by the giving of the notice provided for in O.C.G.A. § 48-5-45, which code sections by reference are incorporated herein as a part of this chapter. 
                  (b)  Where notice of foreclosure of the right to redeem real property sold at a tax sale has not been given as required in subsection (a) of this section, title shall ripen by prescription after a period of four years from the date of recording of the deed in the county where the property is situated; provided the defendant in fi. fa. was not laboring under any legal disability at the time of sale. Unless the tax deed indicates a lesser interest was levied upon and sold, a fee simple title to the property shall vest absolutely in the grantee in the deed or in the grantee's heirs or assigns. In the event the defendant in fi. fa. is laboring under any legal disability, the prescriptive term shall begin from the time the disabilities are removed or abated.

                  Sec. 30-28. - Costs. 
                  (a)  For issuing executions, the city shall receive only an amount equal to the filing fees charged by the clerk of superior court for recording and cancellation of the tax fi. fa. 
                  (b)  Once a levy is made or posted on the property of a defendant in fi. fa., in addition to all taxes, interest, penalties and costs heretofore accrued, the marshal shall collect a levy administration fee of five percent of the taxes due or $250.00, whichever is the lesser; however, no levy administration fee shall be less than $50.00. 
                  (c)  In addition to the levy administration fee, after levy but prior to the sale, the marshal shall collect his actual cost for advertising the sale, postage and service fees actually incurred, and any attorney's fees incurred in examination of title to property, plus a commission for conducting the sale not to exceed eight percent on sums of $50.00 up to $550.00, and three percent on all sums exceeding $550.00. 
                  (d)  The costs provided in this section shall be cumulative and in addition to any statutory premiums allowed as a part of the redemption price.

After receiving the notice, the persons so notified shall neither transfer nor make any other disposition of the credits, other personal property, or debts in their possession or under their control at the time they receive the notice until the city clerk consents to a transfer or disposition or until 20 days elapse after the receipt of the notice. All persons so notified shall within five days after receipt of the notice advise the city clerk of all such credits, other personal property, or debts in their possession, under their control or owing by them.

Failure of the city clerk to mail the notice will release the purchaser from any further obligation to withhold the purchase price as above provided. The time within which the obligation of a successor may be enforced shall start to run at the time the operator sells out his business or at the time that the determination against the operator becomes final, whichever event occurs later. 
                  (f)  Refund of tax, penalty or interest paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected. Whenever the amount of any tax, penalty or interest has been paid more than once or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city under this article, it may be refunded; provided a verified claim in writing therefor, stating the specific ground upon which the claim is founded, is filed with the city clerk within three years from the date of payment. The claim shall be audited and shall be made on forms provided by the city clerk. If the claim is approved by the city clerk, the city manager and the city council, the excess amount collected or paid may be refunded or may be credited on any amounts then due and payable from the person whom it was collected or by whom paid and the balance may be refunded to such person, his administrators or executors.

                  ARTICLE III. - ALARM ORDINANCE 

                  Sec. 34-171. - Definitions. 
                  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Alarm administrator means a person or persons designated by the city or county to administer, control and review false alarm reduction efforts and administer the provisions of this article. 
                  Alarm company means a person subject to the licensing requirements, and/or a company engaged in selling, leasing, installing, servicing or monitoring alarm systems; this person shall be licensed incompliance with city, county and state laws. 
                  Alarm signal means a detectable signal; audible or visual, generated by an alarm system, to which law enforcement is requested to respond. 
                  Alarm system means any single device or assembly of equipment designed to signal the occurrence of an illegal or unauthorized entry or other activity requiring immediate attention and to which law enforcement is requested to respond, but does not include motor vehicle or boat alarms, fire alarms, domestic violence alarms, or alarms designed to elicit a medical response. 
                  Alarm user means any person, corporation, partnership, proprietorship, governmental or educational entity or any other entity owning, leasing or operating an alarm system, or on whose premises an alarm system is maintained for the protection of such premises. 
                  Automatic dial protection device means an automatic dialing device or an automatic telephone dialing alarm system and shall include any system which, upon being activated, automatically initiates to Jackson County 911 a recorded message or code signal indicating a need for law enforcement response. 
                  Cancellation means the process where response is terminated when the alarm company (designated by the alarm user) notifies Jackson County 911 that there is not an existing situation at the alarm site requiring police response after an alarm dispatch request. If cancellation occurs prior to police arriving at the scene, this is not a false alarm for the purpose of civil penalty, and no penalty will be assessed. 
                  City or county means the City [of] Jefferson or its agent. 
                  False alarm means the activation of an alarm system through mechanical or electronic failure, malfunction, improper installation, or the negligence of the alarm user, his/her employees or agents, and signals activated to summon law enforcement personnel unless law enforcement response was cancelled by the alarm user or his/her agent before law enforcement personnel arrive at the alarm location. An alarm is false within the meaning of this article when, upon inspection by the Jefferson Police Department, evidence indicates that no unauthorized entry, robbery, or other such crime was committed or attempted in or on the premises which would have activated a properly functioning alarm system. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a false alarm shall not include an alarm which can reasonably be determined to have been caused or activated by unusually violent conditions of nature nor does it include other extraordinary circumstances not reasonably subject to control by the alarm user. 
                  Local alarm means an alarm system that emits a signal at an alarm site that is audible or visible from the exterior of a structure and is not monitored by a remote monitoring facility, whether installed by an alarm company or user. 
                  Runaway alarm means an alarm system that produces repeated alarm signals that do not appear to be caused by separate human action. The Jefferson Police Department may in its discretion discontinue police responses to alarm signals from what appears to be a runaway alarm. 
                  Verify means an attempt by the monitoring company, or its representative, to contact the alarm site and/or alarm user by telephone and/or other electronic means, whether or not actual contact with a person is made, to attempt to determine whether an alarm signal is valid before requesting law enforcement dispatch, in an attempt to avoid an unnecessary alarm dispatch request. For the purpose of this article, telephone verification shall require, as a minimum that a second call be made to a different number if the first attempt fails to reach an alarm user who can properly identify themselves to attempt to determine whether an alarm signal is valid before requesting law enforcement dispatch.

This article is intended to implement and be consistent with the city comprehensive plan, as it may be adopted or amended in accord with the Georgia Comprehensive Planning Act (O.C.G.A. § 50-8-1 et seq.); and the minimum standards and procedures for local comprehensive planning and the development impact fee compliance requirements, both as adopted by the state board of community affairs and amended from time to time.

                  (7)  Adding uses that are typically accessory to residential uses and intended for the personal use of the residents, such as a deck or patio, satellite antenna, pet enclosure, or private recreational facilities such as a swimming pool. 
                  (c)  Grandfathered projects. Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, that portion of a project for which a valid building permit has been issued prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived shall not be subject to development impact fees so long as the permit remains valid and construction is commenced and is pursued according to the terms of the permit. 
                  (d)  Method of calculation. 
                  (1)  Any development impact fee imposed pursuant to this article shall not exceed a project's proportionate share of the cost of system improvements, shall be calculated on the basis of the establishment of service areas, and shall be calculated on the basis of levels of service for public facilities that are the same for existing development as for new growth and development, as established in the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan. 
                  (2)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this article, the calculation of impact fees shall be the net of the present value of ad valorem tax or other revenues. Such revenues shall be as established in the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan, and are those which: 
                  a.  Are reasonably expected to be generated by new development; and 
                  b.  Are reasonably expected on the basis of historical funding patterns to be made available to pay for system improvements of the same category and in the same service area for which an impact fee is imposed. 
                  (3)  The method of calculating impact fees for public facilities under this article shall be maintained for public inspection as a part of the official records of the city and may be amended from time to time by official act. 
                  (4)  In addition to the cost of new or expanded system improvements needed to be built to serve new development, the cost basis of a development impact fee may also include the proportionate cost of existing system improvements to the extent that such public facilities have excess service capacity and new development will be served by such facilities. 
                  (5)  Development impact fees shall be based on actual system improvement costs or reasonable estimates of such costs, as set forth in the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan. 
                  (Ord. of 4-18-2005(1), §§ 4—4.03) 
                  Sec. 38-24. - Impact fee exemption standards 
                  (a)  Generally. The city has structured its exemption policy to recognize two separate and distinct possible exemption situations: 
                  (1)  Citywide exemptions that may occur at any location within the city limits; and 
                  (2)  Downtown district exemptions which may occur in a certain prescribed district of the city. 
                  (b)  Citywide exemptions. The city recognizes that certain office, retail trade and industrial development projects provide extraordinary benefit in support of the economic advancement of the city's citizens over and above the access to jobs, goods and services that such uses offer in general. To encourage such development projects, the mayor and council may grant a reduction in the impact fee for such a development project upon the determination and relative to the extent that the business or project represents extraordinary economic development and employment growth of public benefit to the city. 
                  (c)  Evaluation criteria. The following factors, among others, will be considered in determining the extent to which a development project represents extraordinary economic development and employment growth of public benefit to the city: 
                  (1)  Preference will be given to the construction or expansion of national or regional corporate office facilities and to construction or expansion projects related to industries primarily involved in research and development, assembly, manufacturing or distribution; 
                  (2)  The total amount of new private capital investment in land, buildings and equipment related to the project; and the total capital investment in current facilities if the project expands an existing business in the city; 
                  (3)  The total annual amount of new wages, purchases and other expenditures that will be generated as a result of the project; and the total annual economic impact of current facilities if the project expands an existing business in the city; and 
                  (4)  Job creation as it relates to: 
                  a.  The total number of jobs created and/or retained as a result of the project; 
                  b.  The number of jobs created and/or retained paying at least 100 percent of the average wage for the county as established by the state department of labor; and 
                  c.  The number of jobs created or retained that are exempt managerial and/or professional and/or senior executive jobs. 
                  (d)  Downtown district exemptions. 
                  (1)  The city recognizes that certain development projects provide extraordinary benefit in support of the economic advancement of the city's citizens over and above the access to jobs, goods and services that such uses offer in general. The city has determined that the encouragement of certain types of development in several specific areas of the city will tend to create extraordinary economic development and employment growth within the city. In order to be eligible for downtown district exemption, the proposed development must be in one of the following historic districts (as defined on the attached map): 
                  a.  The Downtown Historic District; 
                  b.  The Martin-Cooley Historic District; 
                  c.  The Oak Avenue Historic District; or 
                  d.  The Washington-Lawrenceville Historic District; 
                  or, the development must be located in the central business district, as defined by the official zoning map of the city. 
                  (2)  Within the specified districts, the following types of development projects shall be eligible to seek an exemption from the payment of developmental impact fees that would otherwise be assessed: 
                  a.  Adaptive reuse of a detached single-family dwelling for an office; 
                  b.  Adaptive reuse of a detached single-family dwelling for an enclosed retail establishment; 
                  c.  Bed and breakfast inn; 
                  d.  Business service establishment, less than 2,500 square feet of gross floor area; 
                  e.  Commercial recreational facility, indoor; 
                  f.  Daycare center serving no more than 17 persons; 
                  g.  Finance, insurance, or real estate establishment, including banks, less than 2,500 square feet of gross floor area; 
                  h.  Museum; 
                  i.  Restaurant without drive through services; 
                  j.  Retail trade establishment, enclosed; or 
                  k.  Special event facility. 
                  The latest edition of the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) manual may be consulted by the administrator in order to define and determine the eligibility of any project purporting to be one of the above listed land uses. 
                  (e)  Impact fee exemption guidelines. Any applicant for an exemption must present a written request for such an exemption to the impact fee program administrator (as defined in this article). The request must include such data of relevance to the evaluation criteria provided in subsection (c) of this section and may include any relevant documents in support of the request. The administrator shall then prepare a report for the mayor and council with a recommendation on whether the exemption should be granted, and if so, what amount should be exempted. The amount of the exemption will be related to the public benefit, as determined under the evaluation criteria above, and such other factors as the administrator may consider relevant. Acting upon the recommendation of the administrator, but not bound by that recommendation, an impact fee exemption may then be granted by the mayor and council for a development or expansion project that is determined to represent extraordinary economic development and employment growth of public benefit to the city. 
                  (f)  Reimbursement to impact fee fund. It is recognized that the cost of system improvements otherwise foregone through exemption of any impact fee must be funded through revenue sources other than impact fees. As part of the annual budgeting process, adequate funds shall be identified and transferred to the impact fee fund accounts equal to the amount of all exemptions granted during the preceding year. 
                  (Ord. of 4-18-2005(2)) 
                  Sec. 38-25. - Fee assessment and payment. 
                  (a)  Fee schedule. 
                  (1)  Payment of a development impact fee pursuant to the fee schedule in section 38-35, for a property located inside of the city, shall constitute full and complete payment of the project's proportionate share of system improvements and shall be deemed to be in compliance with the requirements of this article. 
                  (2)  When a land development activity for which an application for a building permit has been made includes two or more buildings, structures or other land uses in any combination, including two or more uses within a building or structure, the total development impact fee shall be the sum of the fees for each and every building, structure, or use, including each and every use within a building or structure. 
                  (3)  In the event that an applicant contends that the land use category of the proposed development is not shown on the fee schedule or fits within a different category, then: 
                  a.  The administrator in his sole discretion shall make a determination as to the appropriate land use designation and the appropriate development impact fee; 
                  b.  In making such determination, the administrator may require such additional information from the applicant as necessary to form a logical fee determination relative to the impact fees shown on the adopted fee schedule; 
                  c.  If a land use designation is not in a category contained in this article, then an appropriate new category may be added by the administrator and an appropriate fee established under the city's current impact fee methodology, subject to annual confirmation by the city council; and 
                  d.  Appeals from the decision of the administrator shall be made to the city council within 30 days of the administrator's decision. 
                  (b)  Timing of assessment and payment. 
                  (1)  Development impact fees shall be assessed at the time of application for a building permit as to the amount to be collected. 
                  (2)  All development impact fees shall be collected no earlier than the time of issuance of a building permit, and no later than as a prerequisite to issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the building. 
                  (3)  For projects that qualify as "development," as defined herein but do not involve issuance of a building permit, all development impact fees shall be collected at the time of approval of the development permit or such other authorization to commence construction or to commence use of a property. 
                  (4)  If the final use of a building cannot be determined at the time of the initial building permit, the administrator shall have the authority to assess a development impact fee based on the most likely use of the building, and shall adjust the fee in accordance with the actual use prior to issuance of an interior finishes permit or approval of a certificate of occupancy. An adjustment may result in a refund to the fee payor or payment of the marginal increase of the adjusted fee over the amount already paid. 
                  (5)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, any future change in demand for public facilities created by a development project in excess of the demand anticipated at the time of issuance of the building permit shall be assessed such additional fee as would otherwise have been due. The additional assessment shall be payable by the original fee payor, current or original property owner, or other appropriate responsible party. Future changes in demand may result from a change in the land use category of the occupant of the building or property, the expansion of a building or use on a property that results in an increase in the units of development (as defined herein), or the subsequent discovery of facts unknown or misrepresented at the time of issuance of the building permit. 
                  (c)  Individual assessment determinations. Individual assessments of development impact fees may be established as follows: 
                  (1)  At his option, an applicant for development approval may petition the administrator for an individual assessment determination of development impact fees due for their project. 
                  (2)  In the event that an applicant elects an individual assessment, the applicant shall submit an individual assessment study. Each individual assessment study shall: 
                  a.  Be based on relevant and credible information from an accepted standard source of engineering or planning data; or 
                  b.  Be based on actual, relevant and credible studies or surveys of facility demand conducted in the city or its region, carried out by qualified engineers or planners pursuant to accepted methodology; and 
                  c.  Provide any other written specifications as may be reasonably required by the administrator to substantiate the individual assessment determination. 
                  (3)  The administrator in his sole discretion shall determine whether the content of an individual assessment study satisfies the requirements of this article. A negative determination by the administrator may be appealed to the city council within 30 days for a final decision. 
                  (4)  Any fee approved as an individual assessment determination shall have standing for 180 days following the date of approval. Payment of such an approved individual assessment determination shall constitute full and complete payment of the project's proportionate share of system improvements and shall be deemed to be in compliance with the requirements of this article. 
                  (d)  Fee certification. Upon application to the administrator, a developer may receive a certified schedule of development impact fees for categories of development or a certified fee for a particular project, as applicable. Such certified schedule or fee shall establish the development impact fee due for a period of 180 days from the date of certification, even if new or revised rate schedules are adopted in the interim. 
                  (Ord. of 4-18-2005(1), § 5) 
                  Sec. 38-26. - Policy relative to fee reduction. 
                  The city recognizes that certain office, retail trade and industrial development projects provide extraordinary benefit in support of the economic advancement of the city's citizens over and above the access to jobs, goods and services that such uses offer in general. To encourage such development projects, the city council may consider granting a reduction in the impact fee for such a development project upon the determination and relative to the extent that the business or project represents extraordinary economic development and employment growth of public benefit to the city. 
                  (Ord. of 4-18-2005(1), § 6) 
                  Sec. 38-27. - Deposit and expenditure of fees. 
                  (a)  Maintenance of funds. 
                  (1)  All development impact fee funds collected for future expenditure on construction or expansion of facilities pursuant to this article shall be maintained in one or more interest-bearing accounts until encumbered or expended. Restrictions on the investment of development impact fee funds shall be the same that apply to investment of all such funds generally. 
                  (2)  Separate accounting records shall be maintained for each category of system improvements within each service area wherein fees are collected. 
                  (3)  Interest earned on development impact fees shall be considered funds of the account on which it is earned and shall be subject to all restrictions placed on the use of development impact fees under this article. 
                  (b)  Expenditures; restrictions. 
                  (1)  Expenditures from the impact fee accounts shall be made only for the category of system improvements within the service area for which the development impact fee was assessed and collected. 
                  (2)  Except as provided below, development impact fees shall not be expended for any purpose that does not involve building or expanding system improvements that create additional capacity available to serve new growth and development. 
                  (3)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this article, the following shall be considered general revenue of the system, and may be expended accordingly: 
                  a.  Impact fees collected to recover the present value of excess capacity in existing system improvements; 
                  b.  Any portion of an impact fee collected as a repayment for expenditures made by the city for system improvements intended to be funded by such impact fee; and 
                  c.  Any portion of the impact fee (but not to exceed three percent of the total) collected and allocated by the administrator for administration of the impact fee ordinance, and such additional amount assessed for repayment of the cost of preparing the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan. 
                  (c)  Annual report. 
                  (1)  The administrator shall prepare an annual report to the city council as part of the annual audit describing the amount of any development impact fees collected, encumbered, and used during the preceding fiscal year by category of public facility and service area. 
                  (2)  Such annual report shall be prepared following guidelines of the state department of community affairs (DCA), and submitted to DCA in conjunction with the annual update of the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan. 
                  (Ord. of 4-18-2005(1), § 7) 
                  Sec. 38-28. - Credits. 
                  (a)  Generally. When eligible, fee payors shall be entitled to a credit against impact fees otherwise due and owing under the circumstances and in the manner set forth in this section. 
                  (b)  Restrictions. 
                  (1)  Except as provided in subsection (b)(2) of this section, no credit shall be given for construction, contribution, or dedication of any system improvement or funds for system improvements made before the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived. 
                  (2)  If the value of any construction, dedication of land, or contribution of money made by a developer (or his predecessor in title or interest) for system improvements that are included for impact fee funding in the capital improvements element of the city comprehensive plan, prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived, is greater than the impact fee that would otherwise have been paid for the project, then the developer shall be entitled to a credit for such excess construction, dedication, or funding. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this article, any credit due under this section shall not constitute a liability of the city, and shall accrue to the developer to the extent of impact fees assessed for new development for the same category of system improvements within the same service area. 
                  (3)  In no event shall credit be given for project improvements, or for system improvements not included for impact fee funding in the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan. 
                  (c)  Granting of credits. 
                  (1)  Credit shall be given for the present value of any construction of improvements, contribution or dedication of land, or payment of money by a developer or his predecessor in title or interest for system improvements of the same public facilities category and in the same service area for which a development impact fee is imposed; provided that: 
                  a.  The system improvement is included for impact fee funding in the capital improvements element of the city comprehensive plan; 
                  b.  The amount of the credit does not exceed the portion of the system improvement's cost that is eligible for impact fee funding, as shown in the capital improvements element; and 
                  c.  The city council shall have explicitly approved said improvement, contribution, dedication, or payment and the value thereof prior to its construction, dedication, or transfer. 
                  (2)  The credit allowed pursuant to this article shall not exceed the impact fee due for such system improvement unless a greater credit is allowed under a private agreement executed under the provisions of this article. In the event that a developer enters into such a private agreement with the city to construct, fund, or contribute system improvements such that the amount of the credit created is in excess of the impact fee which would otherwise have been paid for the development project, the developer shall be reimbursed for such excess construction, funding, or contribution from impact fees paid by other development located in the service area which is benefited by such improvements. 
                  (d)  Guidelines for valuation. Credits under this section shall be valued using the following guidelines: 
                  (1)  For the construction of any system improvements by a developer or his predecessor in title or interest and accepted by the city, the developer must present evidence satisfactory to the administrator of the original cost of the improvement, from which present value may be calculated; 
                  (2)  For any contribution or dedication of land for system improvements by a developer or his predecessor in title or interest and accepted by the city, the original value of the land shall be the same as that attributed to the property by the validated tax appraisal at the time of dedication, from which present value may be calculated; 
                  (3)  For any contribution of capital equipment that qualifies as a system improvement by a developer or his predecessor in title or interest and accepted by the city, the value shall be the original cost to the developer of the capital equipment or the cost that the city would normally pay for such equipment, whichever is less; 
                  (4)  For any contribution of money for system improvements from a developer or his predecessor in title or interest accepted by the city, the original value of the money shall be the same as that at the time of contribution, from which present value may be calculated; and 
                  (5)  In making a present value calculation, the discount rate used shall be the net of the interest returned on a state, AA rated or better municipal bond less average annual inflation, or such other discount rate as the city council in its sole discretion may deem appropriate. 
                  (e)  Application. 
                  (1)  Credits shall be given only upon written request of the developer to the administrator. A developer must present written evidence satisfactory to the administrator at or before the time of development impact fee assessment. 
                  (2)  The administrator, in his sole discretion, shall review all claims for credits and make determinations regarding the allowance of any claimed credit, and the value of any allowed credit. 
                  (3)  Any credit approved by the administrator shall be acknowledged in writing by the administrator and calculated at the time of impact fee assessment. 
                  (f)  Abandoned building permits. In the event that an impact fee is paid but the building permit is abandoned, credit shall be given for the present value of the impact fee against future impact fees for the same parcel of land, upon submission of adequate evidence to the administrator that an impact fee was received by the city, the amount paid, and that the building permit was abandoned.

                  Sec. 38-29. - Refunds. 
                  (a)  Eligibility. 
                  (1)  Upon the request of a fee payor regarding a property on which a development impact fee has been paid, the development impact fee shall be refunded if: 
                  a.  Capacity is available in the public facility for which the fee was collected but service is permanently denied; or 
                  b.  The development impact fee has not been encumbered or construction has not been commenced within six years after the date the fee was collected. 
                  (2)  In determining whether development impact fees have been encumbered, development impact fees shall be considered encumbered on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis. 
                  (b)  Notice of entitlement. When the right to a refund exists due to a failure to encumber the development impact fees, the administrator shall provide written notice of entitlement to a refund to the fee payor who paid the development impact fee at the address shown on the application for development approval or to a successor in interest who has given adequate notice to the administrator of a legal transfer or assignment of the right to entitlement to a refund and who has provided a mailing address. Such notice shall also be published in the city within 30 days after the expiration of the six-year period after the date that the development impact fee was collected and shall contain a heading "Notice of Entitlement to Development Impact Fee Refund." No refund shall be made for a period of 30 days from the date of said publication. 
                  (c)  Filing a request. All requests for refunds shall be made in writing to the administrator within one year of the time the refund becomes payable or within one year of publication of the notice of entitlement to a refund, whichever is later. Failure to make a claim for a refund within said time period shall result in a waiver of all claims to said funds. Such funds together with the accrued interest thereon shall be transferred to the general revenue account of the city. 
                  (d)  Payment. 
                  (1)  All refunds shall be made to the fee payor within 60 days after it is determined by the administrator that a sufficient proof of claim for refund has been made, but no sooner than 30 days after publication of the notice of entitlement to the refund. 
                  (2)  A refund shall include a refund of a pro rata share of interest actually earned on the unused or excess impact fee collected. 
                  (3)  In no event shall a fee payor be entitled to a refund for impact fees assessed and paid to recover the cost of excess capacity in existing system improvements, or for that portion of the fee payment that was assessed for administration of the impact fee ordinance or for recovery of the cost of preparation of the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan.

                  Sec. 38-30. - Private contractual agreements. 
                  (a)  Authorized. Nothing in this article shall prohibit the voluntary mutual approval of a private contractual agreement between the city and any developer or property owner or group of developers and/or property owners in regard to the construction or installation of system improvements and providing for credits or reimbursement for system improvement costs incurred by a developer, including interproject transfers of credits or providing for reimbursement for project improvement costs which are used or shared by more than one development project; provided that: 
                  (1)  The system improvements are included for impact fee funding in the capital improvements element of the city comprehensive plan; and 
                  (2)  The amount of any credit granted shall not exceed the portion of the system improvement's cost that is eligible for impact fee funding. 
                  (b)  Provisions. A private contractual agreement for system improvements may include, but not be limited to, provisions which:

                  (b)  Water and sewer service shall not be reconnected until the customer's delinquent bill, including penalty and disconnection charges, have been paid in full. Should such customer thereafter desire to be reconnected to the water and sewer system, a reconnection charge as set forth in the fee schedule in chapter 22 shall be collected.

Such claim, if made after the bill has become delinquent, shall not be effective in preventing discontinuance of service as heretofore provided. The consumer may pay such bill under protest and said payment shall not prejudice his claim. 
                  (1)  The city will make a special water meter reading at the request of a consumer for a fee as set forth in the fee schedule of chapter 22; provided, however, that if such special reading discloses that the meter was overread, no charge will be made. 
                  (2)  Water meters will be tested at the request of the consumer upon payment to the city of the actual costs of making the test (minimum $10.00); provided, however, that if the meter is found to overregister beyond three percent of the correct volume, no charge will be made. 
                  (3)  If the seal of a meter is broken by other than the city's representative or if the meter fails to register correctly or is stopped for any cause, the consumer shall pay an amount estimated from the record of his previous bills and/or from other proper data.

                  Sec. 54-83. - Equivalent residential unit defined. 
                  The term "equivalent residential unit" (ERU) is a standardizing concept, which allows demands for water consumption by different types of residential units and nonresidential uses to be compared to (and expressed in terms of) a single-family, detached, site-built dwelling. One equivalent residential unit (ERU) is equal to the general average water consumption of a single-family, detached, site-built dwelling which is 100 gallons per capita per day or 250—300 gallons per unit depending on household size. The equivalent residential units (ERUs) for various uses are provided in the following table:
