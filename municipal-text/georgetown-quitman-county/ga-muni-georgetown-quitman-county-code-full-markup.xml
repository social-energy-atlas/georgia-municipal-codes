         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE                   This Code constitutes a codification of the general and permanent ordinances of the Georgetown-Quitman County, Georgia. 
                  Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances adopted by the board of commissioners. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any ordinance included herein. 
                  The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
                  Chapter and Section Numbering System 
                  The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
                  Page Numbering System 
                  The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

                   
                  Indexes 
                  The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
                  Looseleaf Supplements 
                  A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
                  Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
                  Acknowledgments 
                  This publication was under the direct supervision of Milton E. Lefkoff, Senior Code Attorney, and Sherry A. Albritton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
                  The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Chad Corlee, County Attorney, and Ms. Carolyn M. Wilson, County Clerk, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the county readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the county's affairs.

                  (b)  In the preparation of a supplement to this Code, all portions of the Code which have been repealed shall be excluded from the Code by their omission from reprinted pages. 
                  (c)  When preparing a supplement to this Code, the codifier (meaning the person authorized to prepare the supplement) may make formal, nonsubstantive changes in ordinances or parts of ordinances included in the supplement, insofar as it is necessary to do so to embody them in a unified code. For example, the codifier may: 
                  (1)  Organize ordinances and resolutions into appropriate subdivisions; 
                  (2)  Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles; 
                  (3)  Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the Code and, where necessary to accommodate new material, change existing section or other subdivision numbers; 
                  (4)  Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case may be, or to "sections _____ to _____" (inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinances incorporated in the Code); and 
                  (5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meaning of the ordinance or resolution sections inserted in the Code; but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code.

                  (b)  The repeal of an ordinance or resolution shall not affect any punishment or penalty incurred before the repeal took effect, nor any suit, prosecution or proceeding pending at the time of the repeal, for an offense committed or cause of action arising under the ordinance or resolution repealed, nor any right acquired or liability incurred under any ordinance or resolution repealed.

                  The chairman of the board of commissioners is responsible for the orderly conduct of the meeting. In order to fulfill this duty, the chairman must enforce the rules of procedure that are adopted by the board of commissioners.

If a commissioner objects to an item being on the consent agenda, the chairman shall move that particular item to the regular agenda. Following the reading of the consent agenda, the chairman will ask for unanimous approval of the items on the consent agenda.

                  (2)  Public participation on agenda items. By a majority vote, the board may allow public comment on an agenda item at the time the item is being considered by the board. These comments must be limited to the subject that is being debated. Members of the public may speak for five minutes and may only speak once. These limits can be waived by a majority vote of the board. Anyone wishing to speak at any board meeting must be recognized by the chairman before addressing the board. 
                  (3)  Decorum.

                  Sec. 2-91. - Main motion. 
                  In order for the board to take any official action on any subject, a commissioner must propose a main motion. A proposed main motion will not be recognized by the chairman until another commissioner agrees to second the motion. A second does not require the commissioner seconding the motion to support the motion. A commissioner may withdraw a main motion that he has made at any time before the board has voted on that motion.

                  Sec. 2-92. - Debate. 
                  (a)  After the main motion, as described in section 2-91, is recognized by the chairman, the board shall debate the motion. The debate shall be managed by the chairman in a manner that is fair to all members of the board. Commissioners can participate in the debate only when they are recognized by the chairman. 
                  (b)  During the course of debate, commissioners may introduce subsidiary motions that propose that the board take a particular action on a motion as described in section 2-95. There are two classes of subsidiary motions: debatable subsidiary motions and undebatable subsidiary motions. Debatable subsidiary motions consist of motions to postpone indefinitely, amend, refer to committee, and postpone to a time certain. Debatable subsidiary motions require a second before they can be voted on or debated. There are three undebatable subsidiary motions: limit debate, vote immediately and lay on the table. They require a second and cannot be debated. 
                  (c)  Commissioners may also introduce privileged motions as described in section 2-96. Privileged motions facilitate the running of the meeting and can be introduced during the course of debate.

                  Sec. 2-93. - Voting procedure. 
                  Voting on debatable motions and voting on undebatable motions shall take place in accordance with the following provisions: 
                  (1)  Debatable motions. In the case of debatable motions, the vote can be proposed in one of two ways: 
                  a.  If debate has been completed and no other commissioner wishes to speak, the chairman can call for a vote. If there are no objections then the chairman can proceed with the vote. 
                  b.  If the chairman calls for the vote and there is an objection, a member of the board may move to vote immediately (move the previous question). If this motion is seconded and approved by a two-fifths vote, debate will stop. The chairman will then read the proposed motion to the board and ask for the votes of the commissioners. 
                  (2)  Undebatable motions. In the case of undebatable motions, the vote shall occur immediately after the motion is recognized by the chairman. The chairman shall read the proposed motion to the board and then call for a vote. 
                  (Ord. of 4-8-1997, § 1-03) 
                  Sec. 2-94. - Ranking of motions. 
                  (a)  Each subsidiary and privileged motion is assigned a specific rank. A motion of higher precedence can interrupt a motion of lower precedence. The higher motion must be decided before the board returns to consider the motion of lower precedence. 
                  (b)  A main motion has the lowest rank and does not take precedence over any other motion. A motion to adjourn has the highest rank and will take precedence over all other subsidiary and privileged motions. The order of precedence of motions shall be in accordance with this section. Motions at the top of the following list take precedence over motions at the bottom of the list: 
                  (1)  Highest rank. 
                  a.  Privileged motions (undebatable): 
                  1.  Adjourn. 
                  2.  Recess. 
                  3.  Question of privilege. 
                  b.  Subsidiary motions (undebatable): 
                  1.  Lay on the table (postpone temporarily). 
                  2.  Vote immediately (previous question). 
                  3.  Limit debate or extend. 
                  c.  Subsidiary motions (debatable): 
                  1.  Postpone to a time certain (postpone definitely). 
                  2.  Refer to committee (commit). 
                  3.  Amend. 
                  4.  Postpone indefinitely. 
                  d.  Other motions. 
                  (2)  Lowest rank: Main motion. 
                  (Ord. of 4-8-1997, § 1-04) 
                  Sec. 2-95. - Subsidiary motions. 
                  During the course of debate, commissioners may introduce motions that propose that the board take a particular action on a main motion. These motions are called subsidiary motions and they allow a board to reach a conclusion of the main motion. Subsidiary motions require a second before they can be voted on or debated. Three subsidiary motions, amend, limit debate and vote immediately, also can apply to other subsidiary motions. 
                  (1)  Postpone indefinitely. If a commissioner believes that the main motion should not be considered by the board, that commissioner may move to postpone the consideration of the main motion indefinitely. If the motion is successful, consideration of the main motion stops and the main motion is tabled for the duration of the meeting. A motion to postpone indefinitely may be debated but it cannot be amended. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (2)  Amend. If a commissioner believes that a main motion that is on the table should be changed in order to make it more acceptable, he can move to amend the motion. Amendments must be closely related to the original motion and must not change the nature of the motion that they amend. Motions to refer, amend, postpone to a time certain and the motion to recess can also be amended. A motion cannot be amended more than two times. Debate is allowed on a motion to amend only if the original motion is debatable. Debate is limited to the proposed amendment. A majority vote is required for the board to adopt an amendment. If the amendment is adopted, then the board shall consider the amended version of the motion. 
                  (3)  Refer to a committee (commit). If a commissioner believes that further information is needed before the board can act on a main motion, he may propose that the motion be referred to a specific committee or department for further study. If an appropriate committee does not already exist, then a committee may be formed as a part of the motion. A motion to commit should specify the date that the committee or department will report back to the board. This motion is debatable and amendable. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (4)  Postpone to a time certain (postpone definitely). A motion to postpone to a certain time may be proposed if a commissioner believes that the main motion should not be considered until a future time. This motion shall set a particular time for the main motion to be considered again. It is debatable and can be amended. If this motion is passed, the chairman will bring the original motion back to the board for consideration at the specified time which may be at the same meeting, at a subsequent meeting, or upon the occurrence of a specified event. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (5)  Limit or extend limits of debate. A motion to limit debate places a time constraint on the length of debate. The details of such motion are to be decided by the commissioner who makes the motion. This motion can also be used to extend the limits of debate if a limit on debate already exists. Debate is not allowed on this motion and a two-fifths vote is required. 
                  (6)  Vote immediately (previous question). If a commissioner believes debate on a motion should end and that the motion that is being considered should be voted on, the commissioner can move to vote immediately. The motion is undebatable and a vote of two-fifths of the board is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (7)  Lay on the table (postpone temporarily). A motion to lay on the table proposes that the consideration of a main motion be posted until a later time in the same meeting. The main motion can be brought back for consideration only if a motion to resume consideration is accepted by the board during the same meeting. The motion will die if it is not taken up during the meeting. Debate is not allowed on this motion and the motion is not amendable. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (Ord. of 4-8-1997, § 1-05) 
                  Sec. 2-96. - Privileged motions. 
                  Privileged motions facilitate the running of the meeting. They do not address or relate to the main motion and can be introduced whether or not there is a main motion under consideration. Privileged motions take precedence over all subsidiary motions. Debate is not allowed on these motions. 
                  (1)  Question of privilege. A formal question addressed to the chairman concerning the rights of a commissioner or of the board as a whole is referred to as a question of privilege. It does not require a second and cannot be debated or amended. The chairman is required to make a ruling on the question. 
                  (2)  Recess. A motion to recess proposes that the meeting be suspended for a particular amount of time when business is still pending. It is a temporary intermission of the proceedings. The motion must specify the length of the recess. The motion must also be seconded. Debate is not allowed on this motion, but the motion can be amended. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (3)  Adjourn. In order for a meeting to come to a close, a commissioner must make a motion to adjourn. The motion to adjourn has the highest rank of any motion and as a result it can be introduced at any time. The motion requires a second, but is not debatable or amendable. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (Ord. of 4-8-1997, § 1-06) 
                  Sec. 2-97. - Incidental motions. 
                  Incidental motions allow commissioners to exert their rights as a member of the board. Incidental motions can be introduced at any time during a meeting. 
                  (1)  Appeal. If a commissioner disagrees with a ruling that is made by the chairman, that commissioner may appeal the decision. If the appeal is seconded, the appeal will be considered by the board. The chairman has the opportunity to explain the ruling that has been challenged. The board may then debate the appeal. The board shall decide by majority vote if the chairman's decision is to be upheld or overturned. An appeal is high in precedence and can only be interrupted by a privileged motion or by a motion to lay on the table. 
                  (2)  Parliamentary inquiry. If a commissioner has a question about the rules of order, he may ask the chairman to give an opinion on that question. This question should take the form of a parliamentary inquiry and should relate to the current business of the board. This motion takes precedence over all motions except privileged motions. This motion does not require a second and is not debatable or amendable. 
                  (3)  Point of order (question of order). If a commissioner believes that a violation of the rules of parliamentary procedure has occurred, he can raise a point of order. A second is not required. The chairman can make a ruling on the question or can allow the board to debate and then rule on the question by a majority vote. A point of order can only be interrupted by a privileged motion or a motion to lay on the table. 
                  (4)  Point of information (request for information). These motions allow the board to act on a main motion that has either been passed or tabled by the board. These motions are considered to be main motions but differ from usual main motions in the ways specified. 
                  (Ord. of 4-8-1997, § 1-07) 
                  Sec. 2-98. - Supplementary main motions. 
                  (a)  Reconsider. The motion to reconsider allows the board to debate whether or not to overturn a decision made at the meeting that is in progress. It allows the board to consider new information that may affect the decision that has already been made. Any commissioner can make a motion to reconsider and any commissioner may second the motion. The motion is debatable but it cannot be amended. A majority vote of the board is required for the motion to pass. If a motion to reconsider is passed, the original decision will be voided and the board will return to debate and re-vote the original motion. 
                  (b)  Rescind. A motion to rescind proposes that the board overturn a motion passed at a previous meeting. A motion to rescind can be made by any commissioner. It is in order as long as the original motion has not been implemented. An announcement of the intention to rescind a motion may be made at the meeting where the decision was made, or the commissioner seeking to rescind may place the matter on the agenda for the next meeting. The motion to rescind will formally be made. If it is seconded, then the board shall debate and vote on rescission. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. If a motion to rescind is passed, the original decision will be voided. 
                  (c)  Resume consideration. The motion to resume consideration allows the board to consider a motion that has been temporarily postponed. This motion requires a second and is not debatable or amendable. It is a main motion but ranks higher than any debatable motion. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass.

                  As an expression of the standards of conduct for members expected by the unified government, the Georgetown-Quitman County Code of Ethics is intended to be self-enforcing. It therefore becomes most effective when members are thoroughly familiar with it and embrace its provisions. For this reason, ethical standards shall be included in the regular orientations for candidates for the commission of the unified government, applicants to authorities, boards, committees and commissions, and newly elected and appointed officials. Members entering office shall sign a statement affirming they have read and understood the Georgetown-Quitman County Code of Ethics. In addition, the commission of the unified government, authorities, boards, committees and commissions, shall annually review the code of ethics and the commission of the unified government shall consider recommendations from boards, committees and commissions to update it as necessary.

                  Sec. 2-227. - Compliance and enforcement. 
                  The Georgetown-Quitman County Code of Ethics expresses standards of ethical conduct expected of members of the commission of the unified government, authorities, boards, committees and commissions. Members themselves have the primary responsibility to assure that ethical standards are understood and met, and that the public can continue to have full confidence in the integrity of the unified government. The chairs of authorities, boards, committees and commissions and the chair of the commission of the unified government have the additional responsibility to intervene when actions of members that appear to be in violation of the code of ethics are brought to their attention. The commission of the unified government may impose sanctions on members whose conduct does not comply with the unified government's ethical standards, such as reprimand, formal censure, loss of seniority or committee assignment, or budget restriction. Where allowed by law, the Commission of the Unified Government of Georgetown-Quitman County, Georgia also may remove members of appointed authorities, boards, committees and commissions from office. A violation of this code of ethics shall not be considered a basis for challenging the validity of a decision of the commission of the unified government, authority, board, committee or commission. Refusal to sign the member statement will result in the disqualification of an appointee.

                  (a)  In order to provide for the health, safety and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within the county and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be ensured. For this reason, it is necessary to protect the subsurface water resources that the county and surrounding communities rely on as sources of public water. 
                  (b)  Groundwater resources are contained within underground reservoirs known as aquifers. These aquifers are zones of rock beneath the earth's surface capable of containing or producing water from a well. They occupy vast regions of the subsurface and are replenished by infiltration of surface water runoff in zones of the surface known as groundwater recharge areas. Groundwater is susceptible to contamination when unrestricted development occurs within significant groundwater recharge areas. It is, therefore, necessary to manage land use within groundwater recharge areas in order to ensure that pollution threats are minimized.

                  Sec. 26-71. - Findings of facts. 
                  (a)  The wetlands within the county are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; and open space and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well-being of many communities within the state. 
                  (b)  Nationally, a considerable number of these important natural resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution and other acts. Piecemeal or cumulative losses will, over time, destroy additional wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare. 
                  (c)  It is therefore necessary for the county to ensure maximum protection of wetlands by discouraging development activities in wetlands that may adversely affect wetlands. 
                  (Ord. of 12-12-2000(1), § 1) 
                  Sec. 26-72. - Purpose. 
                  This article shall be known as the Wetland Protection Ordinance of Quitman County, Georgia. The purposes of this article are to promote wise use of wetlands and protect wetlands, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational and aesthetic values.

                  Sec. 26-74. - Wetland protection district. 
                  This article shall apply to all lands within wetlands located within the jurisdiction of the county. The generalized wetland map, and all future revisions, adopted as part of this article, shows the general location of wetlands and shall be consulted by persons contemplating activities in or near wetlands. The generalized wetland map shall be on file at the board of commissioners' office.

                  Sec. 26-75. - Wetland protection district boundaries. 
                  The generalized wetland map is a general reference document and wetland boundaries indicated on the map are approximations. The purpose of the generalized wetland map is to alert developers/landowners if they are within proximity to a wetland, which means that there is a high likelihood of the presence of a jurisdictional wetland and a need for the developer/landowner to seek US Army Corps of Engineers guidance as to whether a section 404 permit will be required prior to any activity. The generalized wetland identification map does not represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the jurisdiction of the county and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the US Army Corps of Engineers, as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this article does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements.

                  Sec. 26-77. - Process for approval and permit. 
                  (a)  Application for site approval and sewage disposal construction permit shall be made by filing an application with the county health department. 
                  (b)  Such application shall be made to the health department at least 15 days prior to the beginning construction of an individual sewage disposal system. 
                  (c)  The site approval and sewage disposal system will be based upon requirements of the state rules and regulations for individual sewage disposal system, chapter 2705-25, adopted under O.C.G.A. title 31. 
                  (d)  The county sanitarian will submit a copy of each site approval application to the natural resource and conservation office for review. This review will determine the potential of the construction activities to negatively impact the jurisdictional wetlands protected by section 404 of the Clean Water Act. For reference purposes, copies of the most recent national wetland inventory maps will be maintained at the natural resource conservation offices. If it appears that jurisdictional wetlands are on the site and will be impacted, the applicant will be notified by the natural resource conservation service that a wetlands alteration permit from the corps of engineers will be required.

                  State waters means any and all rivers, streams, creeks, branches, lakes, reservoirs, ponds, drainage systems, springs, wells and other bodies of surface or subsurface water, natural or artificial, lying within or forming a part of the boundaries of the state which are not entirely confined and retained completely upon the property of a single individual, partnership or corporation. 
                  Structural erosion and sedimentation control practices means practices for the stabilization of erodible or sediment-producing areas by utilizing the mechanical properties of matter for the purpose of either changing the surface of the land or storing, regulating or disposing of runoff to prevent excessive sediment loss. Examples of structural erosion and sediment control practices are riprap, sediment basins, dikes, level spreaders, waterways or outlets, diversions, grade stabilization structures, sediment traps and land grading, etc. Such measures can be found in the publication Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia. 
                  Trout streams means all streams or portions of streams within the watershed, as designated by the environmental protection division of the state department of natural resources under the provisions of the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, O.C.G.A. § 12-5-20 et seq. Streams designated as primary trout waters are defined as water supporting a self-sustaining population of rainbow trout, brown trout or brook trout. Streams designated as secondary trout waters are those in which there is no evidence of natural trout reproduction, but are capable of supporting trout throughout the year. First order trout waters are streams into which no other streams flow except springs. 
                  Vegetative erosion and sedimentation control measures means measures for the stabilization of erodible or sediment-producing areas by covering the soil with: 
                  (1)  Permanent seeding, sprigging or planting, producing longterm vegetative cover; 
                  (2)  Temporary seeding, producing shortterm vegetative cover; or 
                  (3)  Sodding, covering areas with a turf of perennial sod-forming grass. 
                  Such practices can be found in the publication Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia. 
                  Watercourse means any natural or artificial body of water, stream, river, creek, channel, ditch, canal, conduit, culvert, drain, waterway, gully, ravine or wash in which water flows either continuously or intermittently and which has a definite channel, bed and banks, and including any area adjacent thereto subject to inundation by reason of overflow or floodwater. 
                  Wetlands means those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas.

                  Sec. 26-115. - Minimum requirements for erosion and sedimentation control using best management practices. 
                  (a)  Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land disturbing activities. Therefore, plans for those land disturbing activities which are not excluded by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion and sedimentation control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion and sedimentation control plans. Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of this section. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion and sedimentation pollution during all stages of any land disturbing activity. 
                  (b)  (1)  Best management practices as set forth in this subsection shall be required for all land disturbing activities. Proper design, installation and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with subsection (b)(2) of this section or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f). As used in this section, the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed to control soil erosion and sedimentation for all rainfall events up to and including a 25-year rainfall event. 
                  (2)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or by the division or of any general permit for construction activities issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f) for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or by the division or of any general permit for construction activities issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f) for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
                  (c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances or resolutions adopted pursuant to this article for the purpose of governing land disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices, to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the state soil and water conservation commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion. 
                  (2)  Cut and fill operations must be kept to a minimum. 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practical erosion potential. 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented. 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum. 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable. 
                  (7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development. 
                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control measures shall be installed as soon as practicable. 
                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in runoff water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this subsection, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of this article. 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping surface of fills. 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property. 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners. 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum. 
                  (14)  Land disturbing activity plans for erosion and sedimentation control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on the site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection (b) of this section. 
                  (15)  Except as provided in subsection (c)(16) of this section, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, or where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented; however, buffers of at least 25 feet, established pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-440 et seq., shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this subsection. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the streambed; however, any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the streambed; and 
                  b.  On or before December 31, 2000, the board shall adopt rules which contain specific criteria for the grant or denial by the director of requests for variances. After such date, no variance shall be granted by the director which is not consistent with the criteria contained in such rules; however, should the board fail to adopt rules which contain specific criteria for the grant or denial of requests for variances by the director on or before December 31, 2000, the authority of the director to issue such variances shall be suspended until the board adopts such rules. 
                  (16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as trout streams pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-20 et seq., except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; however, small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board providing for notice to the division or local issuing authority of the location and extent of the piping and prescribed methodology for minimizing the impact of such piping and for measuring the volume of water discharged by the stream. Any such pipe must stop short of the downstream landowner's property, and the landowner must comply with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the streambed: however, any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the streambed; and 
                  b.  On or before December 31, 2000, the board shall adopt rules which contain specific criteria for the grant or denial by the director of requests for variances. After such date, no variance shall be granted by the director which is not consistent with the criteria contained in such rules; however, should the board fail to adopt rules which contain specific criteria for the grant or denial of requests for variances by the director on or before December 31, 2000, the authority of the director to issue such variances shall be suspended until the board adopts such rules. 
                  (d)  Nothing contained in this section shall prevent an issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances or resolutions that contain requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. 
                  (e)  The fact that land disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standard provided for in this section or the terms of the permit.

However, the property owner is the only party that can obtain a permit. 
                  (b)  Application requirements. 
                  (1)  No person shall conduct any land disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the county without first obtaining a permit from the board of commissioners or its designee to perform such activity. 
                  (2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the board of commissioners or its designee and must include the applicant's erosion and sedimentation control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Such plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection (c) of this section. Soil erosion and sedimentation control plans shall conform to the provisions of section 26-115. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by five copies of the applicant's soil erosion and sedimentation control plans. 
                  (3)  A fee, in the amount of $50.00 minimum up to five acres and $5.00 per acre or portion thereof above five acres, shall be charged for each acre or fraction of an acre in the project area. 
                  (4)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion and sedimentation control plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by section 26-115(c)(15), (16) and bonding, if required as per subsection (b)(6) of this section, have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. 
                  (5)  Except as provided in this subsection, no permit shall be issued pursuant to subsection (b)(2) of this section unless the erosion and sediment control plan has been approved by the appropriate district as is required by O.C.G.A. § 12-7-10. When the governing authority of a county or municipality lying within the boundaries of the district demonstrates capabilities to review and approve an erosion and sediment control plan and requests an agreement with the district to conduct such review and approval, the district, with the concurrence of the commission, shall enter into an agreement which allows the governing authority to conduct review and approval without referring the application and plan to the district, if such governing authority meets the conditions specified by the district as set forth in the agreement. A district may not enter into an agreement authorized in this section with the governing authority of any county or municipality which is not certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). 
                  (6)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or this section within three years prior to the date of filing of the application under consideration, the issuing authority may deny the permit application. The issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre of the proposed land disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the issuing authority may call the bond or any part of the bond to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. This subsection shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  (c)  Plan requirements. 
                  (1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements contained in section 26-115.

                  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Alcohol content means grams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood or grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath. 
                  Cross reference— Definitions generally, § 1-2. 
                  Sec. 34-32. - Findings of facts; statement of policy. 
                  (a)  It is the position of the board of commissioners that alcohol and controlled substance abuse is the number one health problem in the United States today. The costs involved with this problem include human costs such as lost jobs, morale problems, injuries, illnesses and deaths, as well as economic costs such as property damage, tardiness, absenteeism, lost productivity, increased health insurance costs and the costs involved in replacing and retraining new employees. It is a problem of epic proportion, reaching every community in the United States. 
                  (b)  The use of alcohol or controlled substances by county employees while on the job constitutes a direct threat to property and the safety of others. The work involved in many positions may be dangerous, and the safety of citizens and employees depends upon the ability of employees to think clearly with unimpaired faculties. 
                  (c)  It is the objective of the board of commissioners to provide safe and effective public service. To meet this objective, the problem of alcohol and controlled substance abuse must be identified, confronted and defeated. In order to achieve this, the board of commissioners has developed a comprehensive alcohol and controlled substance policy. 
                  (Ord. of 8-8-1995(2), § 1) 
                  Sec. 34-33. - Overview of the policy. 
                  (a)  The alcohol and controlled substance policy of the county is made up of two separate but interrelated programs: 
                  (1)  An employee awareness/supervisor training program. 
                  (2)  An alcohol and controlled substances screening test program. 
                  (b)  The alcohol and controlled substance policy was developed to prevent the illicit use of alcohol or controlled substances by county employees, without violating the legal rights of those employees. 
                  (c)  The alcohol and controlled substance policy has four primary goals. These are to: 
                  (1)  Prevent the abuse of alcohol and controlled substances by county employees; 
                  (2)  Combat the abuse of alcohol and controlled substances in a way that is cost effective; 
                  (3)  Clearly communicate the position of the board of commissioners regarding the abuse of alcohol and controlled substances; and 
                  (4)  Provide a legal means of employee control. 
                  a.  Prevention. It is universally accepted that alcohol and controlled substance abuse is destructive. Yet many individuals start or continue these habits because they lack reliable information about the devastating effects of alcohol and controlled substance abuse. The alcohol and controlled substance policy seeks to educate employees about the facts behind substance abuse so that they can see the potential effects of this behavior. This should help prevent employees from developing alcohol or controlled substance-related problems. The policy also seeks to educate and motivate the nonusing coworkers so that they will encourage employees with alcohol or controlled substance related problems to seek help. The policy also seeks to communicate to the employees the fact that the board of commissioners is concerned about alcohol and controlled substance abuse among its employees, and that the board of commissioners will do everything within its power to prevent such abuse. 
                  b.  Cost effectiveness. Although alcohol and controlled substance abuse is recognized primarily for its human costs, the economic costs associated with the problem are also unacceptable. Properly instituted, the alcohol and controlled substance policy will increase worker productivity and decrease absenteeism, accidents and health care costs. Since generally the workers affected by the policy are in safety-sensitive positions, the policy will also help decrease the chances of the county being held legally liable for acts committed by an impaired employee. Finally, the policy should improve employee retention rates, thereby lowering employee turnover costs such as hiring and training new employees to replace those who have quit or have been terminated due to alcohol or controlled substance abuse. 
                  c.  Clear communication of the county's position. The alcohol and controlled substance policy seeks to effectively communicate to each employee and the general public the position that alcohol and controlled substance abuse will not be tolerated among employees of the county. Employee awareness of this position and the mechanisms to enforce this position should act as a deterrent to substance abuse. Additionally, awareness on the part of employees may encourage those who believe they might have a problem to seek assistance. Awareness of the provisions of the policy should lead to greater compliance with the policy by all employees. Furthermore, publicity about the policy should act to increase public respect for the employees of the county. Implementing such a policy reassures the citizens that county employees are not entitled to a double standard, that they do, in fact, obey the law, and that they will continue to serve as role models for citizens of all ages. The policy will also reassure the public that county services paid for by tax dollars are the safest and most effective services available. 
                  d.  Legal method of control. It is necessary for the county to control its employees, as it may be held liable for injuries to coworkers or the public caused by impaired employees. At the same time, county employees have rights that need to be protected. The policy balances these two interests, by stating precisely what is expected of the employees as well as explaining what will happen should a violation of the policy occur.

                  Sec. 34-34. - Responsibility for administration. 
                  The overall responsibility for the alcohol and controlled substance policy lies with the office of the board of commissioners or its designee. Drug tests and any other expenditures for program costs will be approved by the personnel office, subject to funds being annually appropriated therefor. Although these programs cost money to implement, they should prove to be cost effective if they eradicate alcohol and controlled substance abuse among all employees. As used in the policy, the term "controlled substance" shall have the meaning and include the substances defined as controlled substances in the Georgia Controlled Substances Act, O.C.G.A. § 16-13-20 et seq., and particularly O.C.G.A. § 16-13-21(4), as such provisions shall now appear or hereafter be amended.

                  (a)  Prohibited acts. Listed below are acts or actions which are expressly prohibited under the regulations of the alcohol and controlled substance policy of the county: 
                  (1)  The use or possession of alcohol or any controlled substance while on work time or work premises. 
                  (2)  The sale, distribution or provision of alcohol or any controlled substance while on work time or work premises. 
                  (3)  Reporting to work, or working, while intoxicated or otherwise impaired by alcohol or controlled substance use. 
                  (4)  Alcohol or controlled substance-related off-duty conduct that tends to undermine the reputation, authority, safety or efficiency of the county or its citizens. 
                  (5)  The use or possession of prescribed narcotics or dangerous substances while on work premises, or while working, unless: 
                  a.  The prescribing physician has been notified of the duties involved with the employee's position, and has approved the use of the drug while that employee is performing those duties; and 
                  b.  The employee's immediate supervisor has been notified in writing by the employee that he is using a prescription drug and that the employee's physician has approved the use of the drug while the employee is at work. 
                  (6)  Arrest or conviction (including a plead of nolo contendere) for a violation of any criminal drug statute of any jurisdiction (federal or state) regardless of whether the alleged violation occurred at the work place or elsewhere. 
                  (7)  Failure to comply with any provision of this article as now or hereafter amended. 
                  (b)  Implementing the alcohol and controlled substance policy. 
                  (1)  The basic idea behind the county's alcohol and controlled substance policy is that employee alcohol and controlled substance abuse can be prevented by supplying the employees with information about the problems alcohol and controlled substances can create. The awareness program is subdivided into two sections, an employee education section to include all county employees and a supervisor training section. 
                  (2)  The board of commissioners may contract with an employee awareness program firm to provide the instruction and materials for the two sections. In choosing an awareness program service, the county will determine that: 
                  a.  The firm is accredited; 
                  b.  It regularly provides awareness program services; 
                  c.  It is willing to provide the names of other corporate or municipal clients as references; and 
                  d.  The institution would be willing to establish an alcohol and controlled substance treatment relationship with the county. 
                  (3)  For the employee education section, the alcohol and controlled substance awareness service that is selected will provide: 
                  a.  Educational seminars; 
                  b.  Questionnaires at both the start and completion of the program (to chart any belief/knowledge changes); 
                  c.  Audiovisual programs; 
                  d.  Group discussions; 
                  e.  A presentation of what a treatment program is, what it does and how to take advantage of one; and 
                  f.  A description and discussion of the board of commissioners of the alcohol and controlled substance policy. 
                  (4)  The supervisor training section will focus on the important role supervisors have in preventing alcohol and controlled substance abuse. The program will include: 
                  a.  Instruction in identifying warning signs of alcohol and controlled substance abuse by employees; 
                  b.  Role playing scenarios; 
                  c.  Group discussions; 
                  d.  First line supervisors and upper level supervisors, during which first line supervisors should be assured of the support they will receive should they intervene with a problem employee; and 
                  e.  A thorough presentation of the alcohol and controlled substance policy, with particular emphasis placed upon the procedural requirements involved with disciplining an employee. 
                  (c)  Implementing the alcohol and controlled substances abuse testing program. 
                  (1)  Findings. The board reiterates its commitment to an alcohol and drug-free workplace. Not only does such commitment require testing of county employees upon reasonable cause to believe that an employee is in violation of the county's alcohol or drug abuse policies, it also requires testing of county employees who are uniquely involved, because of their duties as county employees, in dangerous occupations, those involved in utilizing their judgment, dexterity, physical abilities or those whose duties involve a risk of physical injury to fellow employees or citizens, or those involved in duties where inattention to duty or errors in judgment while on duty will have the potential for significant risk of harm to the employee, other employees or the general public. As a result, the board deems it necessary to require alcohol and controlled substances testing for its employees who have police powers, are employed as correctional officers, van drivers, deputies, law enforcement officers, guards, truck drivers and heavy equipment operators, not only upon reasonable cause, but also as a condition of employment and as part of the annual physical examination for such employees. 
                  (2)  Establishing the necessary test procedures. 
                  a.  The first step in implementing the screening test program will be to provide employees with proper notice. Copies of the alcohol and controlled substance policy shall be distributed to each affected employee through bulletin board posting of the notice thereof to each present employee and to each applicant for county employment at the time he obtains his application for employment. 
                  b.  After distribution of the alcohol and controlled substance policy has occurred, the board of commissioners will establish a professional relationship with a qualified laboratory for the purpose of conducting controlled substance screening. A precontract award assessment will occur before the laboratory is actually utilized. When testing for controlled substances, urine samples will be used. Samples will be collected at a doctor's office or a hospital by medically qualified personnel. The samples will be carefully checked and marked with the name of the employee, the date the sample was collected and the location where the sample was collected. A chain of custody will be established so that samples are properly handled before and after testing occurs. 
                  c.  When testing for alcohol, the standard breathalyzer test will be used. Although all on-job use of or impairment by alcohol is prohibited by the alcohol and controlled substance policy, a blood alcohol content of 0.05 grams or greater shall be conclusive proof of the employee's violation of the county's alcohol policy. A blood alcohol content of 0.05 grams or less shall also be proof of the employee's violation of the county's alcohol policy if the employee is sufficiently impaired so as to be unable to carry out his duties as determined by the employee's supervisor and such employee shall be subject to the remedies provided in the policy. The employee has the right to request a blood test if he desires. The blood test will be at the employee's expense and may be considered as evidence by the appropriate county official, but shall not be deemed conclusive. 
                  (3)  Types of alcohol and drug testing. 
                  a.  A drug and/or alcohol screening test shall be administered pursuant to the alcohol and controlled substance policy if a supervisor or other person has a reasonable cause to believe that an employee has violated the policy. This basis for an alcohol or controlled substance test may be utilized when such reasonable cause exists, as to any employee of the county. A reasonable cause determination must be based upon objective indications of substance abuse or other policy violations. Some of the more obvious indications of alcohol and/or controlled substance abuse which, when taken alone or in combination with other observable facts and circumstances include, but are not limited to: 
                  1.  Sudden unexplained changes in work performances; 
                  2.  Failure to follow instructions or procedures; 
                  3.  Violations of safety policies and other rules and regulations; 
                  4.  Involvement in an accident or near-accident in which safety precautions were violated or unusually careless acts were performed; 
                  5.  Discovery or presence of alcohol or controlled substances in an employee's possession, vehicle or near the individual's workplace; 
                  6.  Odor of alcohol or residual odor peculiar to some drug or chemical substance; 
                  7.  Appearance that the employee is unfit for duty; 
                  8.  Unexplained or frequent absenteeism or tardiness; 
                  9.  Personality changes, unusual appearance or disorientation; or 
                  10.  Bloodshot eyes, slurred speech, lethargic behavior or behavior inappropriate or inconsistent with circumstances. 
                  b.  These are a few considerations to keep in mind before a test upon reasonable cause is administered. Thorough documentation of all steps of the investigation is required. This will include such items as memos to the personnel file of the employee stating why a reasonable cause exists, notes placed in the file stating the date and time of any discussions with the employee regarding substance abuse and the employee's reaction, and documentation of any evidence suggesting alcohol or controlled substance abuse. However, in documenting the investigation, every reasonable effort shall be made to ensure the confidentiality of the employee and of the results of any tests administered under the alcohol and controlled substance policy. 
                  c.  After it has been determined that a reasonable cause exists, the employee shall be tested for the presence of alcohol and/or controlled substances. The employee will be called into the personnel office, informed of the allegations of the alcohol and controlled substance policy violation, and be requested to sign the employee consent and notice form. If the employee refuses to consent to the testing, he will be disciplined, up to and including discharge. 
                  d.  If the employee consents to the screening test, and the confirmed results indicate the presence of alcohol or controlled substances in the employee's system, the employee will be discharged. The fact that the employee's alcohol or controlled substance abuse had affected the employee's work performance to the degree that a reasonable cause was developed in the first place, should be considered when deciding whether to discharge the employee. 
                  e.  At the time the employee is called to the personnel office, where reasonable cause is established, the employee shall be suspended with pay pending the outcome of the investigation for the safety and welfare of the individual, other employees and the public. If the investigation reveals that the employee has not violated the alcohol and controlled substance policy, the employee will report back to work. 
                  (d)  Pre-employment testing of applicants. 
                  (1)  During the final interview process, all job applicants, including volunteer firefighters, who are selected to fill a position will be provided with a copy of the pre-employment consent and notice form. At that time, the alcohol and controlled substance policy shall be explained to the applicant, including volunteer firefighters, and the pre-employment consent and notice form shall be signed by the applicant, including volunteer firefighters. 
                  (2)  Should the applicant, including volunteer firefighters, refuse to sign the consent form, the application process will continue. On the application it will be noted only that the applicant refused screen. It will not mention suspected alcohol or drug use by the applicant, or volunteer firefighters. The applicant and volunteer firefighters have a right to refuse to consent to the test, but the county has the parallel right to refuse to hire the applicant, including volunteer firefighters. However, should an inquiry as to that specific application be made by the applicant, including volunteer firefighters, or a third party at a later date, the county must be sure to protect the confidentially of the application process. The county shall not authorize release of the fact that the applicant, including volunteer firefighters, refused to consent to an alcohol or controlled substance screen. 
                  (3)  If the applicant, including volunteer firefighters, being considered for the position has consented to the test and the test results are negative, the applicant, including volunteer firefighters, will continue with the hiring process. However, should the test results come back positive for controlled substances, the test result must be confirmed. This will involve a decision to either re-test the sample using the same technique or test the sample using a confirmatory technique. This decision may be made for the county by the testing laboratory itself. 
                  (e)  Post-employment testing. 
                  (1)  Post-employment controlled substance testing shall be conducted for law enforcement officers, correctional officers, van drivers, truck drivers, volunteer firefighters and heavy equipment operators. These tests shall be scheduled on a random basis by the board or its designee. 
                  (2)  Any employee, including volunteer firefighters, who refuses to sign the consent form associated with these tests will either be referred to the employee awareness program or be disciplined up to and including discharge, depending on the circumstances. 
                  (3)  If the confirmed results indicate the presence of controlled substances in the employee's system, including volunteer firefighters, the employee or volunteer firefighter will be either referred to the employee awareness program or disciplined up to and including discharge in accordance with subsection (c)(3)a. of this section.

                  ARTICLE III. - POLICIES AND PROCEDURES MANUAL 

                  Sec. 34-61. - Introduction. 
                  The following Georgetown-Quitman County, GA. Policies and Procedures Manual has been prepared to present the policies and procedures for employees and elected officials of Georgetown-Quitman County, GA. These policies and procedures were developed in order to guide the public servants of the county in maintenance of a high level of professionalism, economy of operation, and ultimate maximum personal output for the benefit of the citizens of Georgetown-Quitman County, Georgia. 
                  Quitman County was created by an Act of the Georgia Legislature in 1858. It was named for General John S. Quitman, a leader in the Mexican War and a Governor of Mississippi. The county economy was originally based on agri-business and reached its economic and population peak between 1890 and 1910. Although the size and population of the county (2,209 residents in 1990 Census) is small in number, residents share the benefits of an area with excellent natural resources available such as the 78,000-acre Walter F. George Reservoir, ample hunting and fishing opportunities and a great place to live and raise a family for those enjoying a great climate and active year-round outdoor activities. 
                  We in Georgetown-Quitman County Government are proud to live in our county and serve our fellow residents and neighbors. 
                  The five-member Georgetown-Quitman County, GA. Board of Commissioners is elected by the voters of the county to manage the operations of government within the county. The Commission of Georgetown-Quitman County, GA. is responsible for establishing policy guidance for the county's employees. Policy guidance also includes the development of job descriptions. The following sections delineate policies to be utilized by county employees and elected officials in day to day operations. They are presented in an alphabetized arrangement in order to expedite finding answers to questions and promote understanding. 
                  (Ord. of 4-3-07) 
                  Sec. 34-62. - Introductory probationary period. 
                  (a)  The introductory period is intended to give new employees the opportunity to demonstrate their ability to achieve a satisfactory level of performance and to determine whether the new position meets their expectations. Georgetown-Quitman County uses this period to evaluate employee capabilities, work habits, and overall performance. Either the employee or Georgetown-Quitman County may end the employment relationship at will at any time during or after the introductory period, with or without cause or advance notice. 
                  (b)  All new and rehired employees work on an introductory basis for 90 calendar days after their date of hire. Any significant absence will extend an introductory period by the length of the absence. If Georgetown-Quitman County determines that the designated introductory period does not allow sufficient time to thoroughly evaluate the employee's performance, the introductory period may be extended for a specified period. 
                  (c)  Upon satisfactory completion of the introductory period, employees enter the "regular" employment classification. However, such completion does not alter Georgetown-Quitman County employee at-will relationship with its employees. During the introductory period, new employees are eligible for those benefits that are required by law, such as worker's compensation insurance and Social Security. They will not be eligible for other Georgetown-Quitman County benefits prior to completion of the introductory period.

                  In the event of absence from work employees are expected to notify their supervisor or manager immediately upon the opening of business on the day absent. This must be done for each day of absence. 
                  If your absence goes unreported for three consecutive days or if you have three unreported absences within a two-month period, your employment will be terminated. 
                  (1)  Absence due to illness/injury.

                  c.  There are times when illness or some other reason makes it necessary to be absent.

                  Sec. 34-73. - Electronic/e-mail/internet policy. 
                  (a)  Introduction. Georgetown-Quitman County provides e-mail and internet access to employees in an effort to give its employees a tool to communicate easily and efficiently. Employees must be mindful that use of the electronic communications systems should be limited to county business. The sole exception to the above sentence since employees may make incidental and occasional personal use as long as such use does not interfere with an employee's performance of his or her job responsibilities or the business use of such systems by other employees. The county has a right of access to all e-mail and all information on county-provided computers. No individual should have any expectation of privacy with messages sent or received. Since confidentially is not readily attainable when using e-mail and because many e-mail communications are public records, employees should never use e-mail for making harassing or threatening statements or expressing personal opinions on noncounty related matters. 
                  (b)  Definitions. 
                  (1)  E-mail means an electronic message transmitted between two or more computers or electronic terminals, whether or not the message is converted to hard copy format after receipt and whether or not the message is viewed upon transmission through a local, regional, or global computer network. 
                  (2)  Electronic communications means each of the county's electronic communications systems, including, without limitation, e-mail, the internet and any intranet established by or on behalf of the county. This does exclude voice telephone communications, i.e., 911-telephone call taking/dispatching. 
                  (3)  The internet means the global computer network accessed via modem, ISDN, DSL, cable modem or T-1 line, whether directly or through an internet service provider. 
                  (4)  Public record means all documents, papers, letters, maps, books, tapes, photographs. Computer-based or generated information, or similar material prepared and maintained or received during the operation of a county office or agency. Public record also means such items received or maintained by a private person or entity on behalf of a county office or agency which is not otherwise subject to protection from disclosure. 
                  (c)  Scope. All e-mail communications and associated attachments transmitted or received over the Georgetown-Quitman County network and/or any computer equipment owned by Georgetown-Quitman County and all use of the electronic communications systems of the county are subject to the provisions of this policy. In addition and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, since Georgia law provides that e-mail communications written in the course of operation of a public office are generally considered to be public records, all e-mail communications written and sent in the conduct of public business by Georgetown-Quitman County employees and/or representatives are subject to the provisions of this policy under the heading "Application of Public Records Statutes to E-Mail", regardless of whether the communication was sent or received on a public or privately owned personal computer.

                  (1)  The electronic communications systems hardware and software are county property, and all messages composed, sent or received on the electronic communications systems are and remain the property of the county. They are not the private property of any individual. 
                  (2)  Use of the electronic communications systems are reserved solely for the conduct of county business. They may not be used for personal business or gain. Personal use is limited to incidental and occasional use that does not interfere with the employee's performance of his or her job responsibilities or the business use of e-mail by other employees.

The contents of electronic communications may be disclosed within or outside the county without the consent of any individual. 
                  (2)  The confidentiality of any message should not be assumed. Even when a user erases a message, it is still possible to retrieve and read that message. Furthermore, the use of passwords for security does not guarantee confidentiality. All passwords must be disclosed to the county upon request. 
                  (f)  Prohibited uses. 
                  (1)  The electronic communications systems may not be used to solicit, recruit for, conduct business for, or manage any commercial ventures, religious or political causes or outside organizations. 
                  (2)  The electronic communications systems shall not be used to create, send or forward any chain e-mails, advertisements, solicitations or nonbusiness-related messages. No social networking during work hours is prohibited by county employees.

Among the prohibited sites, which cannot be visited using the electronic communications, systems are sites containing sexually related material or any other sites portraying information not reasonably calculated to be of use for the county. 
                  (5)  For materials copyrighted by third parties, the electronic communications systems should not be used to receive (download) or transmit (upload) such copyrighted materials, unless the third party owner/author has granted an express right for the county and/or the user to download and/or upload. In no event shall any individual attempt to receive or download any so-called "hacker" software or other software whose purpose is to aid the user in improperly accessing secure materials, circumventing security measures or copying or downloading copyrighted material, whether such material is on an internal or external network. 
                  (6)  The electronic communications systems shall not be used to breach or attempt to breach any other network containing any protected information from a third party. 
                  (7)  The electronic communications systems should not be used to transmit or discuss information that currently is or could be the subject of a lawsuit involving the county, including conclusions or opinions as to the existence, absence or enforceability of a grievance, claim or contract or the activities of any individual on behalf of the county.

                  (8)  The electronic communications systems shall not be used to establish web sites or home pages without prior approval of the county manager.

The user's name, electronic mail address, organizational affiliation, time and date of transmission, and related information included with any electronic message posting must always reflect the true originator, time, date and place or origination of the posting or message. 
                  (g)  Application of public records statutes to e-mail. E-mail messages are subject to many of the same statutes and legal requirements and disclosure as other forms of communication, such as the Inspection of Public Records Statute (O.C.G.A. §§ 50-18-70 through 50-18-76). This statute treats computer based or generated information in the same manner as paper documents. All such documents are generally considered to be public records and are subject to public inspection, unless they are covered by a specific statutory exemption. E-mail messages, which are public records, must be retained in either paper or electronic format. An open records request received via e-mail shall be deemed legally received at the time of opening the message; therefore, the recipient shall document the date and time of receipt for compliance purposes. E-mail messages that are not public records should be deleted after viewing. 
                  (h)  Unauthorized reception or review. 
                  (1)  Although the county has the right to retrieve and read any message sent over the electronics communications systems, messages should be treated as confidential by individual users and accessed only by the intended recipient or his/her designee.

                  Sec. 34-76. - Business gifts. 
                  The Georgetown-Quitman County Government prohibits its elected officials, appointed officials and employees from accepting gifts or gratuities from individuals or firms related to county government business. The acceptance of such gifts are unprofessional, unbusinesslike, and places elected officials, appointed officials and county employees in compromising positions, which are not in the best interest of the county government. It is also against county policy to give gifts to businesses and others that do business with the county government. No county funds may be used for funeral or retirement expenses. 
                  (Ord. of 4-3-07)

                  Sec. 34-78. - Compensation. 
                  (a)  Exempt employees. Exempt employees are paid on a salary basis, i.e., their compensation is not based on the number of hours worked. Exempt full-time employees are expected to average working at least 40 hours per week, but to spend the hours necessary to complete their job responsibilities. Those hours worked in excess of an average of 40 hours per week will be counted as compensatory time. See compensatory time. 
                  (b)  Compensatory time. 
                  (1)  For exempt employees who must often work long hours in performing the job requirements of their position, a compensatory time leave is provided as a convenience, but not a mandatory right for such employees. Such leave must have the written approval of the supervisor or county manager. Failure to get proper advance approval can cause the time charged to annual leave, a salary reduction, or a reprimand. 
                  (2)  Compensatory time leave will be granted at the convenience of Georgetown-Quitman County and must not conflict with accomplishment of job duties and responsibilities. 
                  (3)  A maximum of ten days of compensatory time leave may be accumulated and carried over into a new calendar year. 
                  (4)  Hours within 15 minutes prior to opening and 15 minutes after normal closing hours are not used in calculating compensatory time, unless the overtime is in excess of these times. 
                  (c)  Deductions from salaries. Under the provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act no deductions may be made from the salary of any executive, administrative, or professional employee for time lost in any week in which the employee does any work, unless the time lost is: 
                  (1)  An absence of a day or more for personal reasons other than sickness or accident; or 
                  (2)  An absence of a day or more for illness or if the employee's attendance is unsatisfactory. 
                  (3)  A deduction may be made to offset payment received for court or military duty. 
                  (4)  The employee does not maintain an average of 40 hours per week during the work year. 
                  (d)  Supplements to salary. Since time on the job is not the basis for compensating exempt employees, there will normally be no additional compensation for time worked beyond regularly scheduled hours. In the unusual circumstance that satisfactory performance of assigned responsibility mandates time on the job substantially in excess of regular hours, the Commission of Georgetown-Quitman County, may approve supplemental payment to compensate the employee for personal time lost. 
                  (e)  Reimbursement for dinner and lunch. 
                  (1)  Exempt employees shall be reimbursed for dinner within a limit established by the county manager, provided that an employee works at least 2½ hours or more beyond the close of the normal workday and/or is outside the Quitman County, Georgetown, Eufaula area. 
                  (2)  Lunch expense may be reimbursed up to a limit established by the County Commission, provided that an employee works at least four hours on a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday. Receipts are required. 
                  (3)  Exempt county employees include elected officials: Tax commissioner, sheriff, clerk to sheriff's department, probate judge, clerk or courts, and county commissioners. The county nonelected employee positions are: County clerk, county treasurer, sheriff's deputy, county agent, and clerk to probate judge/voter registrar, fire chief and assistant fire chief. 
                  (f)  Nonexempt employees. All nonexempt employees are paid on the basis of hours worked. Nonexempt employees will be compensated on the basis of the total number of hours worked during a given week: 
                  (1)  Up to 40 hours: All work performed up to 40 hours in a single week will be at the straight-time hourly rate, regardless of the length of the regular workweek. 
                  (2)  Over 40 hours: In excess of 40 hours in a single week will be paid at 1½ times the straight-time hourly rate. The nonexempt employees of Georgetown-Quitman County, GA. include: Janitor (part-time), clerk to tax commissioner (full-time/part-time), landfill general worker (part-time) working public works superintendent, working assistant public works superintendent, working mechanic, general worker (3), transit driver substitute transit driver, clerk to county agent, dispatchers for sheriff (part-time) (2), building inspector, assistant county clerk, clerk to tax appraiser, landfill operator, clerk/dispatcher for sheriff, and deputy clerk of courts (part-time). 
                  (g)  Time worked. The following provisions apply to the calculating of nonexempt employee hours' worked: 
                  (1)  Lunch or supper periods: Time off for lunch or supper is not counted as time worked. 
                  (2)  Paid holidays and paid absences: Regularly observed paid holidays and approved paid absences are counted as time worked. Hours of work performed on regularly paid holiday will also be counted.

                  (h)  Early arrivals and late departures. The Federal Fair Labor Standards Act recognizes a reasonable time for getting to and from work stations, which time is considered as hours worked. Georgetown-Quitman County has interpreted "reasonable time" as 15 minutes prior to and following scheduled opening and closing hours. All employees should not arrive at work stations or record their time earlier than 15 minutes before starting time, or not to remain on the premises after closing time, unless permission has been granted for overtime. 
                  (i)  Work away from premises or at home. A nonexempt employee shall not be permitted to perform work at home, unless approved in advance by the supervisor. If approved, work performed off the premises, job site or at home by a nonexempt employee may be counted as time worked. 
                  (j)  Travel. Time spent in travel between the employees' home, and normal work location is not counted as time worked.

                  (g)  Information will also be given to duly authorized requests from law enforcement agencies, including investigations, summonses, subpoenas and judicial orders.

                  (h)  The county has a firm policy of respecting the dignity and worth of each individual employee while asking that the employee give the county his or her loyalty and best efforts in return.

                  Sec. 54-38. - Operational requirements. 
                  (a)  Roads. The use of county roads by an operator transmitting timber or pulpwood must not endanger the traveling public; where damage does occur, the roads so damaged shall be restored to their previous condition, including, but not limited to, removal of debris and mud and replacement of gravel. Trucks or other equipment used in the harvesting operation shall not be allowed to park on the public right-of-way for extended periods of time. 
                  (b)  Warning signs. Any firm, company or person operating on county rights-of-way shall be required to post warning signs at least 500 feet on both sides of the temporary driveway adequately warning oncoming traffic of persons, vehicles, equipment or machinery entering the roadway. 
                  (c)  Termination. At the termination of harvesting activities at each site, the operator shall immediately notify the county commissioner's office, a representative of which shall make an inspection of the site on the county road system affected by the harvesting activities. The inspection shall take place within three working days of receipt of the notice. 
                  (d)  Results of inspection/appeal/release. If the board of commissioners or its designee determines that damage has occurred, the board of commissioners or its designee will make a detailed report, identifying the damage, the remedial action needed to be taken to repair the damage, and the estimated cost to repair the damage. The report shall be delivered to the applicant, and the applicant shall pay the county the cost of the damage within ten days of the receipt of the specifications describing the damage to the road. If the operator does not agree with the assessment of the damages, the operator may appeal the decision, within two days of the receipt of the county's assessment, to an arbitration board. The board of arbitration will include a representative of the operator and a representative of the county. The two arbitrators shall appoint a third arbitrator. The board of arbitration shall set a date for a hearing within two days of their appointment, and the hearing will be had within seven days of the date of their appointment, at the county courthouse. If the board of arbitration finds the operator damaged the county road, the operator shall be required to pay the cost of the arbitration in addition to paying the county for the damage to the road. If the board of arbitration finds there is either no damage to the road, or the damage to the road was not the result of the operator's use of the road, or the damage has been overstated by more than 30 percent, the county and the operator shall each pay half of the cost of the arbitration. If the operator fails to pay the county within ten days of the arbitrators' decision, the county may proceed to enforce the collection of the damages by the issuance of a fi. fa. and by collection of the bond given for the faithful performance and compliance with this article.

                  ARTICLE V. - ZONING DISTRICTS AND BOUNDARIES 

                  Section 5.1. - District designations. 
                  In order to carry out the intent and purpose of this Ordinance, the County is hereby divided into the following districts: 

                   
                  (Ord. No. 04-2016 , 11-7-16) 
                  Section 5.2. - District objectives. 
                  A-1 General Agricultural and Forestry District. This zoning district is comprised primarily of general farming areas where some low density, single-family, residential development has occurred or is occurring. The regulations of the district are designed primarily to encourage a compatible relationship between agriculture and low density, single-family, rural residential development. 
                  R-1 Low Density Residential District. The objective of this district is to preserve land areas for single dwelling unit structures and to promote residential areas with low densities. These areas are intended to be geographically defined and protected from the encroachment of uses not performing a function necessary to a residential environment. 
                  R-1G Zoning District. The R-1G District includes properties located within the old city limits of Georgetown. This district is established to provide areas of single-family site-built homes and modular homes. This district is created also to encourage neighborhood single-family housing consistency and to protect established single-family site-built and modular homes from incompatible land use or an encroachment of uses not performing a function necessary to a residential environment. 
                  R-2 Medium Density Residential District. The objective of this district is to provide and preserve land areas for single dwelling units and low density multiple dwelling units, not to exceed two (2) dwelling units per structure which will achieve an overall medium density of residential development. R-2 Districts should be located in an area with good proximity to central community facilities where stable transition from one district to another is desirable. 
                  R-3 Multifamily Residential. The Multifamily Residential District is established to provide locations for a mix of housing types, including single-family detached residential, attached single-family residential uses, duplexes, triplexes, quadraplexes and townhouses and condominiums. The intention of this district is to incorporate multifamily residential within small complex's that will not create a large impact on services within the community. When residentially compatible institutional and recreational uses are developed within the Multifamily Residential District, they are to be designed and built to ensure density compatibility with adjacent residences. 
                  MHU-1 Manufactured Housing Unit District - Park. The objective of this district is to provide areas within the County for the placement of manufactured housing units in parks which are designed for the placement of manufactured housing units. No new MHU-1 district may be created which contains less than four (4) acres. 
                  C-1 General Commercial District. The objective of this district is to provide and preserve areas for the development of general, personal, service and business activities as well as those for general retail and wholesale business. General compatibility with abutting different uses is required. This may be achieved through buffering, screening and/or development plan review. Noise, odor, dust and glare associated with uses permitted in this district should be confined within buildings so as to minimize the effects upon adjacent development and uses. Development in these districts should be located on arterial streets or collector streets and the associated street network. 
                  I-1 Light Industrial District. The light industrial district is established to provide areas for the development of light industrial and assembly plants and their related activities. It is also the intent of this district that noise, odor, dust and glare associated with uses permitted in this district be confined within buildings so as to minimize the effects upon adjacent development and uses. It is also the intent of this district that traffic generated by uses permitted, including raw materials, finished products and employees, be minimal but that transportation facilities and routes be easily accessible. Development in these districts should be served by sanitary sewer or have provision for on-site disposal. No new I-1 Industrial District may be created which contains less than five (5) acres. 
                  Conservation Protection District (CP). The objective of this district is to establish measures to guide future growth and development in areas that are deemed environmentally sensitive and should be protected from intensive development. 
                  Commercial Outdoor Recreation Development (CORD). This district is a floating zone. The objective of this district is to provide areas for private recreational facilities and activities. No CORD district may be created which contains less than five acres. This does not include seasonal hunting rights between consenting parties. 
                  Planned Unit Development (PUD). The PUD district is established to encourage the appropriate development of tracts of land in all zoning districts sufficiently large enough to allow comprehensive planning and to provide flexibility in the application of certain regulations in a manner consistent with the general purpose of the Zoning Ordinance, thereby promoting a harmonious variety of uses, the economy of shared services and facilities, compatibility with surrounding areas, and the creation of attractive, healthful, efficient and stable environments for living, shopping and working. 
                  (Ord. No. 04-2016 , 11-7-16) 
                  Section 5.3. - Official zoning map. 
                  The location and boundaries of the zoning districts established by this Ordinance are bounded and defined as shown on the maps entitled "Zoning Map of The Unified Government of Georgetown-Quitman County, Georgia." Said map shall also be identified by the signature of the clerk, the County Commissioner of the Unified Government of Georgetown-Quitman County and the adoption date of this Ordinance. The zoning maps and all explanatory matters thereon are hereby adopted and made a part of this Ordinance. 
                  Section 5.4. - District boundaries. 
                  Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of districts as shown on the zoning maps, the following rules shall apply: 
                  1.  Boundaries shown as following or approximately following streets, highways or alleys shall be construed to follow the center lines of such streets, highways or alleys. 
                  2.  Boundaries shown as following or approximately following railroad lines shall be construed to follow the right-of-way of said railroad line. 
                  3.  Boundaries shown as following or approximately following platted lot lines or other property lines shall be construed to be said lot lines. 
                  4.  Boundaries indicated as following or approximately following shorelines shall be construed to follow such shorelines and in the event of change in the shoreline shall be construed as moving with the actual shoreline; boundaries indicated as following or approximately following the center lines of streams, rivers, canals, lakes or other bodies of water shall be construed to follow such center lines. 
                  5.  Boundaries indicated as following or approximately following the old city limits of the City of Georgetown shall be construed as following such city limits. 
                  When the application of the aforementioned rules leaves a reasonable doubt as to the boundaries between two (2) districts, the regulations of the more restrictive district shall govern the entire parcel in question, unless otherwise determined by the planning commission or Board of Commissioners.

                  DIVISION 1. - NONCONFORMING USES 

                  Section 9.1. - Continuation of nonconforming use. 
                  Any structure or use of land existing at time of enactment or subsequent amendment of this Zoning Ordinance, but not in conformity with its use provisions, may be continued with the following limitations: 
                  1.  A nonconforming use may not be changed to another nonconforming use or moved from one location to another. 
                  2.  A nonconforming use or structure may not be re-established after discontinuance of that use for one year. A nonconforming use may not be resumed regardless of any reservation of any intent not to abandon. 
                  3.  A nonconforming use or structure may not be enlarged beyond its size at the time the use or structure became nonconforming. This includes, but is not limited to, the size of the building, operation during other hours of the day or night, the use of additional land either on the same or adjoining property and additional and or more powerful equipment. 
                  4.  A nonconforming structure may not be rebuilt, altered, repaired or replaced after incurring damages exceeding 75 percent of the fair market value of the structure at the time immediately preceding such damage occurring. A nonconforming mobile home may be replaced after it is removed from the property with a manufactured housing unit that is in compliance with the standards set forth in Article 8 as long as such replacement occurs within 12 months of removal. After any period longer than 12 months, a nonconforming mobile home cannot be replaced after it is removed from the property regardless of any reservation of any intent to abandon.

                  The County Commission may grant the change, re-establishment, or enlargement of a nonconforming use or the enlargement, rebuilding, alteration, repair, or replacement of a nonconforming structure upon the following findings: 
                  1.  The structure cannot be economically modified so as to be suitable for uses in the district. 
                  2.  The structure would have to be removed to permit development of the property for conforming uses. 
                  3.  The change, establishment, enlargement, rebuilding, alteration, repair, or replacement would be no more detrimental to the surrounding area than the existing or previous use. 
                  4.  The structure has such value that removal to permit development of the conforming uses would cause economic hardship to the owner. 
                  5.  The proposed change, re-establishment, enlargement, rebuilding, alteration, replacement, or repair would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purposes and intent of this Zoning Ordinance. 
                  6.  The requirements of the Zoning Ordinance for reasoning would prevent the current zoning from being changed to a classification that would allow the proposed change, re-establishment, enlargement, rebuilding, alteration, repair, or replacement. 
                  Section 9.3. - Applications for nonconforming use change.

                  Section 14.10. - Removal of antennae and towers. 
                  All telecommunications facilities within the county shall be maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable building and technical codes in order to ensure the structural integrity of such facilities. If, upon inspection by the building official, any such telecommunications facility is determined not to comply with the code standards or constitutes a danger to persons or property, then, upon notice being provided to the owner of the facility and the property owner if such owner is different, such owners shall have 30 days to bring such facility into compliance; provided, the owner of the facility shall have such extended period as may be required beyond the 30 days if the nature of the cure is such that it reasonably requires more than 30 days and the owner of the facility commences the cure within the 30-day period and thereafter continuously and diligently pursues the cure to completion. If such telecommunications facility is not brought into compliance within the required time period, the county may provide notice to the owners requiring a county fine of $100.00 per day until the antenna or tower is in compliance. The county may provide notice to the owners requiring the telecommunications facility to be removed. If such telecommunications facility is not removed within 30 days of receipt of such notice, the county may remove such facility and place a lien upon the property for the costs of removal. Delay by the county in taking such action shall not in any way waive the county's right to take action. The county may pursue all legal remedies available to it to ensure that telecommunications facilities not in compliance with the code standards, or which constitute a danger to persons or property, are brought into compliance or removed. The county may seek to have the telecommunications facility removed regardless of the owner's or operator's intent to operate the tower or antenna, and regardless of any permits, federal, state or otherwise, which may have been granted.

                  Section 14.11. - Abandonment. 
                  (a)  Any telecommunications facility within the county which is not operated for a continuous period of 24 months shall be considered abandoned, whether or not the owner or operator intends to make use of such facility or any part of it. The owner of a telecommunications facility, and the owner of the property where the facility is located, shall be under a duty to remove the abandoned telecommunications facility. If such abandoned antenna and/or tower is not removed within 60 days of receipt of notice from the county notifying the owners of such abandonment and requesting removal of the telecommunications facility, the county may remove such tower and/or antenna and place a lien upon the property for the costs of removal. The county may pursue all legal remedies available to it to ensure that abandoned telecommunications facilities are removed. Delay by the county in taking action shall not in any way waive the county's right to take action. The county may seek to have the abandoned telecommunications facility removed regardless of the owner's or operator's intent to operate the tower or antenna, and regardless of any permits, federal, state or otherwise, which may have been granted. 
                  (b)  If the owner of an abandoned tower or antenna wishes to use such abandoned tower or antenna, the owner first must apply for and receive all applicable permits and meet all of the conditions of this article as if such tower or antenna were a new tower or antenna.

                  Section 14.12. - Pre-existing towers; nonconforming uses. 
                  (a)  All telecommunications facilities within the county which are operative on the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived shall be allowed to continue their present use. Any tower which is nonconforming with respect to setback requirements set forth in this article may be replaced if such tower is destroyed, provided, the degree to which the structure is nonconforming does not increase and all other requirements of this article are met. Routine maintenance of existing telecommunications facilities shall be required. New construction, other than routine maintenance, shall comply with the requirements of this article. 
                  (b)  A telecommunications facility that has received the county's approval in the form of a building permit as of the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, but has not yet been constructed or placed in operation, shall be considered an existing telecommunications facility as long as such approval is current and not expired. 
                  (c)  Placement of an antenna or collocation on a nonconforming structure, provided, the degree to which the structure is nonconforming is not increased, shall not be considered an expansion of the nonconforming structure.

                  Section 14.14. - Variance. 
                  If the proposed location, height, type, setback or other aspect of a telecommunications tower or antenna cannot comply with the preferred configurations or requirements set forth in this article, a variance permit shall be required for the construction of a tower or the placement of an antenna in the county. 
                  (1)  Requirements for obtaining a variance. 
                  a.  A nonpreferred telecommunications tower or antenna request shall require the applicant to demonstrate in writing to the satisfaction of the commissioners why the applicant cannot use the following: 
                  1.  An existing facility. 
                  2.  A preferred location. 
                  3.  A preferred configuration. 
                  b.  In addition to the requirements set forth in subsection (1)a. of this section, the applicant shall also provide the following: 
                  1.  Collocation sites or other preferred location sites that are located within the geographic service area of the proposed site. 
                  2.  An explanation of good faith efforts and measures taken to secure each of the preferred location sites, and why each site is not technologically, legally or economically feasible for the applicant's needs. 
                  3.  How and why the proposed site is essential to meet service demands for the geographic service area it will cover and for the county-wide network as a whole. 
                  c.  Applicants must identify all existing towers and all towers for which there are applications currently on file with the county or adjacent counties that could service the proposed search area. The applicant must provide evidence of the lack of space on all suitable existing towers. 
                  d.  The commissioners will review the variance request based on the justifications of undue expense and/or difficulties in entering into a lease agreement for collocation with a tower owner. The commissioners shall carefully weigh such claims, and the evidence presented in favor of them, against a facility's negative impacts at the proposed site and on the surrounding area. 
                  e.  The commissioners will indicate to the applicant within 30 days whether a request for a variance permit should be pursued. If the commissioners feels that the applicant's request does not justify a variance permit, then both parties may agree on a minor variance compromise in writing that satisfies all parties and this article. 
                  f.  At no time and under no circumstances shall the commissioners waive more than one of the preferred items (preferred location and preferred configuration) set forth in this article without requiring the applicant to apply for a variance permit. The commissioners shall charge an appropriate fee for county services and expenses in regards to the minor variance consideration, not to exceed $1,500.00. 
                  (2)  Acquisition procedures. 
                  a.  The cost of a variance permit shall be $1,500.00, plus any unusual or sustained costs that the commissioner shall deem necessary and appropriate. There shall be no limit to the unusual or sustained costs, except that they are actual and fair to all parties involved, and that they are agreed upon in writing prior to the execution of the variance process. In the event of unforeseen costs and expenses, both the commissioner and/or the applicant may amend their written agreement with both parties affirming the new agreement in writing. This process may repeat itself as long as both parties agree to it. 
                  b.  In granting a variance permit, the commissioners may impose conditions to the extent that they conclude are necessary to minimize adverse effects from the proposed tower on adjoining or nearby properties. 
                  c.  All engineering information that the applicant submits, whether civil, mechanical or electrical, shall be certified by a licensed professional engineer or qualified industry expert that is acceptable to the commissioner. The commissioner reserves the right to reject any expert or engineering submissions and request additional information from that or another source. 
                  d.  Each applicant requesting a variance permit shall submit a site plan, scaled elevation view and supporting drawings, calculations and other documentation, signed and sealed by appropriate licensed professionals or qualified industry experts, showing the location and dimensions of all structures and improvements, including topography, utilizing minimum two-foot contour intervals, tower height requirements, setbacks, access driveways or easements, parking, fencing, landscaping, adjacent uses and any other information deemed necessary by the commissioners to assess compliance with this article and compatibility with surrounding uses. 
                  e.  Before taking action upon a proposed variance permit, the commissioners shall hold a public hearing on the proposed variance permit. At least 30 days prior to the date of the public hearing, the commissioners shall cause the following notice requirements to be instituted: 
                  1.  A sign shall be erected in a conspicuous location on or adjacent to the property under consideration. The sign shall state the date, time, place, location and purpose of the public hearing. 
                  2.  A letter shall be sent by regular mail to all property owners of record of abutting parcels, giving notice of the public hearing. Owners of record shall be as indicated by the county tax commissioner's records. The letter shall at least state the same information as required in subsection (2)e.1. of this section for the erection of a sign. 
                  f.  A public hearing shall be held by the commissioners. The commissioners will gather all information and hear all reasonable positions, and then shall rule on the variance within 15 days of the public hearing. 
                  1.  If the variance is approved, the applicant may continue with the tower, provided, they observe all other ordinance rules and regulations that pertain to any nonvariance aspects of the tower construction and implementation. 
                  2.  If the variance is not approved, the commissioners will notify the applicant of such denial.
