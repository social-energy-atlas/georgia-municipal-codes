PREFACE 
The Metter Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company in 1997, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Matthew Bender & Company, Inc., its successor in interest. 
During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction of Wanda Leverett, City Administrator. 
Beginning with Supplement No. 6, Municipal Code Corporation will be keeping this code current by regular supplementation. 
The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.010 is Section .010, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by a prior code cross-reference table, which sets out the location of individual sections of the prior code, and an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification. 
A subject matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual sections numbers. 
This supplement brings the code up to date through an ordinance passed January 14, 2019.

SUPPLEMENT HISTORY TABLE 
The table below allows users of this Code to quickly and accurately determine what ordinances have been considered for codification in each supplement. Ordinances that are of a general and permanent nature are codified in the Code and are considered "Included." Ordinances that are not of a general and permanent nature are not codified in the Code and are considered "Omitted." 
In addition, by adding to this table with each supplement, users of this Municipal Code will be able to gain a more complete picture of the Code's historical evolution. 

 
I. HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
This code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code. 
Numbering System. 
The numbering system is the backbone of a code of ordinances; Matthew Bender & Company, Inc. uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
There are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) This note will be updated by Matthew Bender & Company, Inc. as each section is amended, with the most recent amendment added to the beginning. The notation "(part)" is used when the code section contains only part of the ordinance (or section of the ordinance) specified; this indicates that there are other areas of the code affected by the same ordinance (or section of the ordinance). If the code section was derived from an earlier codification, the last entry in the note indicates the old or "prior code" section number. 
Statutory References. 
The statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated by Matthew Bender & Company, Inc. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "Herein." This table will be updated as prior code sections are renumbered or repealed. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
To find a specific ordinance in the code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed by Matthew Bender & Company, Inc. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." When an ordinance is repealed, the disposition will be changed by Matthew Bender & Company, Inc. to "(Repealed by Ord.)" with the appropriate ordinance number. Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
Index. 
If you're not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE  See also BUSINESS TAX  Fee 5.04.030  Required when 5.04.010 
The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Insertion Guide. 
Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Insertion Guide. This guide will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. 
Page Numbers. 
When originally published, this code was numbered with consecutive page numbers. As it is amended, new material may require the insertion of new pages that are numbered with hyphens. (Example: 31, 32, 32-1.) Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) are left unnumbered but the number is "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version. You can send files to us as an e-mail attachment, by FTP, on a diskette or CD-ROM. Electronic files enable us not only to get you your code more quickly but also ensure that it is error-free. Our e-mail address is: ords@municode.com .

SECTION 2.23. - Action requiring an ordinance. 
Acts of the city council which have the force and effect of law shall be enacted by ordinance. 
SECTION 2.24. - Emergencies. 
To meet a public emergency affecting life, health, property, or public peace, the city council may convene on call of the mayor or three councilmembers and promptly adopt an emergency ordinance, but such ordinance may not levy taxes; grant, renew, or extend a franchise; regulate the rate charged by any public utility for its services; or authorize the borrowing of money except for loans to be repaid within 30 days. An emergency ordinance shall be introduced in the form prescribed for ordinances generally, except that it shall be plainly designated as an emergency ordinance and shall contain, after the enacting clause, a declaration stating that an emergency exists and describing the emergency in clear and specific terms. An emergency ordinance may be adopted, with or without amendment, or rejected at the meeting at which it is introduced, but the affirmative vote of at least three councilmembers shall be required for adoption. It shall become effective upon adoption or at such later time as it may specify.

Chapter 2.36 - ETHICS CODE 
Sections: 

2.36.010 - Declaration of policy. 
It is essential to the proper government and administration of the city that its mayor and council and the city-appointed officials covered by this chapter be, and give the appearance of being, independent and impartial, that public service not be used for private gain, and that there be public confidence in the integrity of the city government. Because the attainment of one or more of these ends is impaired whenever there exists in fact, or appears to exist, a conflict between the private interests and public responsibility of city officials, the public interest requires that the city protect against such conflicts of interest by establishing appropriate ethical standards with respect to the conduct of the officials covered by this chapter in situations where a conflict may exist. It is also essential to the efficient operation of the city that those persons best qualified be encouraged to serve in positions of public trust. Accordingly, the standards hereinafter set forth must be so interpreted and understood as to not unreasonably frustrate or impede the desire or inclination of those best qualified to seek and serve in public office. To that end, the officials herein noted should not, except as otherwise provided by law, be denied the opportunity available to all other citizens to acquire and maintain private, economic and other interests, except where a conflict of interest appears. The policy and purpose of this chapter, therefore, is to make clear those standards of ethical conduct that shall apply to the officials herein noted in the discharge of their official duties, to conform with the objective of protecting the integrity of city government, and to prescribe only such essential restrictions as will not impose barriers repugnant to conscientious public service.

5.08.740 - Prohibition of certain types of entertainment, attire and conduct. 
A.  "Findings; public purpose." Based on the experience of other urban counties and municipalities, including, but not limited to, Atlanta and Fulton County, Georgia; Dekalb County, Georgia; Richmond County, Georgia; Amarillo, Texas; Austin, Texas; Garden Grove, California; Houston, Texas; Renton, Washington; Phoenix, Arizona; Indianapolis, Indiana; St. Paul, Minnesota; Tucson, Arizona; Augusta, Georgia; LaGrange, Georgia; Dalton and Whitfield County, Georgia; Carrollton, Georgia; Smyrna, Georgia; and Ft. Lauderdale and Palm Beach, Florida, which experiences, we believe are relevant to the problems faced by the city, the mayor and city council takes note of the notorious and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within our country. Moreover, it is the findings of the mayor and city council that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages, begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with nudity and alcohol are disorderly conduct, prostitution, and drug trafficking and use. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with nudity and alcohol are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhood, increased expenditure for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior herein-above described, and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas. Therefore, the limitation of nude conduct in establishments licensed to sell alcoholic beverages is in the public welfare and it is a matter of governmental interest, and concern to prevent the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments, which serve alcohol and also allow and/or encourage nudity. To that end, this section is hereby adopted. 
B.  "Enactment." The following types of entertainment, attire and conduct are prohibited upon any premises licensed to sell, serve or disperse alcoholic beverages. 
1.  The employment or use of any person, in any capacity, in the sale or service of alcoholic beverages while such person is unclothed or in such attire, costume or clothing, as to expose to view any portion of the female breast below the top of the areola or any portion of the male or female pubic hair, anus, cleft or the buttocks, vulva and genitals. 
2.  Live entertainment where any person appears in the manner described in subsection (1) of this subsection or where such persons (or person) perform(s) acts of or acts which simulate any of the following: 
a.  Sexual intercourse, masturbation, sodomy, bestiality, oral copulation, flagellation or any sexual act which is prohibited by law. 
b.  The touching, caressing or fondling of the breasts, buttocks, anus or genitals. 
c.  The displaying of the male or female pubic hair, anus, vulva or genitals. 
3.  The holding, promotion, sponsoring or allowance of any contest, promotion, special night, event or any other activity where patrons of the licensed establishment are encouraged or allowed to engage in any of the conduct described in subsections (1) and (2) above.

(Ord. of 1-14-19, § 3) 
8.30.040 - General provisions. 
A.  Permit Required. No building, mobile home, structure, or land within the jurisdiction of the City of Metter shall hereafter be erected, constructed, located, moved, used, subdivided, altered or disturbed except in conformity with the regulations herein and without first obtaining a permit from the City of Metter. This provision does and shall apply to the location of all manufactured housing and industrialized buildings in the city. 
B.  Minimum Lot Size. All lots intended for residential or other use within the city shall be of such size as necessary to meet all requirements, rules, and regulations of the Georgia Department of Public Health according to the "Rules of Georgia Department of Public Health for Onsite Sewage Management Systems" Manual for Onsite Sewage Management Systems; and as necessary to comply with the minimums set forth in the tables MT-1 and MT-2 hereby attached to and made a part of this chapter as Appendix 1, if onsite sewage management is utilized, and/or the local County Board of Health determination under the Manual; and/or this or other local ordinance, whichever is stricter (requires the largest lot size). 
C.  Onsite Sewage Management Permit Required. No person or business shall construct an onsite sewage management system on any lot within the city until site approval and an onsite sewage management construction permit has been obtained from and issued by the Candler County Health Department. 
D.  Permit Coordination. The required permit under Section 8.30.040.A. of this chapter shall not be issued until the Candler County Health Department issues an onsite site sewage management construction permit or a site approval letter, whichever is appropriate, so that all lots proposed to be used or subdivided would satisfy the requirements of this Chapter, including the "Rules of Georgia Department of Public Health for Onsite Sewage Management Systems." If the Candler County Health Department is delegated the responsibility for administering this Chapter, the permit or letter under this Section 8.30.040.D. shall suffice as the permit required under Section 8.30.040.A. 
E.  Requirements are Minimum. The regulations and requirements set by this Chapter shall be the minimum requirements. 
F.  Compliance with State and Federal Regulations. All developments, structures, and uses within the city shall also meet the requirements of all other local, federal and state regulations in effect, including but not limited to, Department of Transportation regulations, State Fire Marshal regulations, Georgia's Uniform Construction Codes, Georgia Erosion and Sedimentation Act permits, and all other Georgia Department of Natural Resources and Georgia Environmental Protection Division environmental rules and regulations. Issuance of a permit under this chapter does not constitute certification of compliance with such codes or regulations, and does not abrogate responsibility of the owner to so comply. 
G.  Map Interpretation.

(Ord. of 1-14-19, § 4) 
Editor's note— Appendix 1 is not set out herein at length but is available for review in the offices of the city. 
8.30.050 - Delegation of ordinance administration. 
The City of Metter, because of the need for coordination, hereby charges the City of Metter Zoning Administrator with responsibility for administering this chapter and ensuring compliance with its provisions. 
(Ord. of 1-14-19, § 5) 
8.30.060 - Wetlands protection regulations. 
A.  Findings of Fact. The wetlands within the City of Metter are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion and soil limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife, and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; open space; and recreational opportunities. 
B.  Reference Map. The official maps to be used as the determinant for location of wetlands in the City of Metter and to be regulated areas under this chapter will be the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's National Wetlands Inventory Maps for Candler County. These maps portray generalized wetlands inventory areas, and these wetlands inventory areas do not necessarily represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands under the authority of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and cannot serve as a substitute for a jurisdictional wetland determination or a wetland delineation by that agency. 
C.  Wetlands Development Permit Requirements. No activity or use except those identified in Section 8.30.060.D. shall be allowed within wetlands without a permit issued under this chapter. Activities or uses permitted under Section 404 of the U.S. Clean Water Act may receive a local permit once any required federal permit, or if appropriate, letter of permission/determination, is obtained as described below, and any other applicable provisions of this chapter have been satisfied. 
1.  If there is a determination in the administration of this chapter that a proposed activity, use, or development subject to permit herein would not be located in or near an identified wetlands inventory area and would not disturb an identified wetlands inventory area, no further action concerning this particular ordinance section is necessary. 
2.  If there is a determination in the administration of this chapter that a proposed activity, use, or development subject to permit herein may be located in or near an identified wetlands inventory area and might disturb wetlands which appear to be under the jurisdiction of Section 404 of the U.S. Clean Water Act, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' jurisdictional wetlands determination shall be required prior to issuance of a permit under this chapter. 
3.  If a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' jurisdictional wetlands determination is required, no local permit under this Chapter will be issued until the person requesting the permit, at their own expense, obtains either a Section 404 permit, if so required, or a letter of permission/determination from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that no federal permit is required. 
4.  No action in the administration of this chapter, or no local permit issued pursuant to this chapter, relieves the landowner from any federal or state permitting requirements, including those relating to wetlands or land disturbance. 
D.  Permitted Uses Not Requiring a Permit. The following uses are permitted without permit within the wetlands of the city to the extent they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining, or dredging except as provided herein, and provided they have no long term impairment for wetland function. 
1.  Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the Georgia Forestry Commission. (Section 404 does not require permits for normal, ongoing silvicultural activities. However, Section 404 does list some required road construction best management practices that must be followed in order to qualify for such an exemption.). 
2.  Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish, or other wildlife, provided they do not affect waters of the State of Georgia or of the United States in such a way that would require a Section 404 Permit. 
3.  Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, hunting, bird watching, hiking, biking, boating, horseback riding, kayaking, and canoeing. 
4.  Natural water quality treatment or purification. 
5.  Normal agriculture activities, including the planting and harvesting of crops and pasturing of livestock. Such activities shall be subject to best management practices approved by the Georgia Department of Agriculture. 
E.  Prohibited Uses. In compliance with the Georgia "Rules for Environmental Planning Criteria," the following uses are prohibited entirely and no permit shall be issued for them. 
1.  Receiving areas for toxic or hazardous waste or other contaminants. 
3.  Hazardous or sanitary waste landfills. 
(Ord. of 1-14-19, § 6) 
8.30.070 - Groundwater recharge areas protection regulations. 
A.  Findings of Fact. Recharge areas are vulnerable to urban development activities as well as agricultural activities. Pesticides and herbicides sprayed on crops and animal waste, like septic tank affluents, contribute to a deterioration in the groundwater quality and can threaten the health of residents relying on well water. Development usually means an increase in the amount of land covered with impervious surfaces. Paving land in recharge areas can alter or impair their recharge characteristics thereby decreasing groundwater supplies. 
B.  Reference Map. The official map for delineation of significant groundwater recharge areas in the City of Metter to be regulated areas under this chapter is the Georgia Department of Natural Resources' "Significant Recharge Areas, Hydrological Atlas 18 (1989 edition)." 
C.  Groundwater Recharge Areas Development Permit Requirements. All uses except those identified in Section 7.4 and those subject to further restriction by any underlying zoning district are allowed. The following are additional requirements for specific uses: 
1.  All new above ground chemical or petroleum storage tanks, having a minimum volume of six hundred sixty (660) gallons, shall have secondary containment for one hundred ten (110) percent of the volume of such tanks or one hundred ten (110) percent of the volume of the largest tank in a cluster of tanks, and shall otherwise meet the requirements of U.S. EPA rules for oil pollution prevention, 40 CFR 112.1 and following. Such tanks used for agricultural purposes are exempt, provided they comply with all federal and state requirements. 
2.  All single-family dwellings, multi-family dwellings, mobile home parks, or other uses located within a groundwater recharge area and not served by both public water and sewer systems shall be required to have one hundred fifty (150) percent of the minimum lot or space size calculated based on application of the Georgia Department of Public Health Manual for Onsite Sewage Management Systems (DPH Manual) Tables MT-1 and MT-2 (included as part of this chapter in Appendix 1), as determined by the Candler County Health Department. The minimums set forth in Tables MT-1 and MT-2 may be increased further based on consideration of other factors (set forth in Sections A-F) of the Public Health Manual. Said minimum lot size shall not be in any case less than the minimum lot size specified by any underlying zoning district. The regulations or determination specifying the largest minimum lot size shall apply. 
3.  All lots shall have a minimum width of one hundred fifty (150) feet, or as specified in any underlying zoning district if stricter (larger), in the area where an approved onsite sewage management system is to be located. 
4.  No construction may proceed on a building or mobile home to be served by a septic tank or other onsite sewage management system unless the Candler County Health Department first approves the proposed onsite sewage management system installation as meeting the requirements of the Georgia Department of Public Health Manual for Onsite Sewage Management Systems and the provisions of this chapter. 
5.  All new wastewater treatment basins shall have an impermeable liner except for the construction of mining settling basins. 
6.  All new agricultural waste impoundment sites shall be lined. As a minimum, the liner shall be constructed of compact clay having a thickness of one-foot and a vertical hydraulic conductivity of less than 5 x 10 -7 cm/sec or other criteria established by the U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service, or Georgia's Environmental Protection Division. 
D.  Prohibited Uses. The following uses are prohibited entirely and no permit shall be issued for them. 
1.  All new hazardous waste storage, treatment and disposal facilities. 
2.  New facilities handling hazardous materials regulated by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources as to require a permit. 
3.  Permanent stormwater infiltration basins. 
4.  All new sanitary or other landfills. 
(Ord. of 1-14-19, § 7) 
Editor's note— Appendix 1 is not set out herein at length but is available for review in the offices of the city. 
8.30.080 - Major river corridor protection district regulations. 
A.  Findings of Fact. Perennial river or water courses with an average annual flow of at least four hundred (400) cubic feet per second are of vital importance to Georgia in that they help preserve those qualities that make a river suitable for habitat for wildlife, a site for recreation, and a source for clean drinking water. These river corridors also allow the free movement of wildlife from area to area within the state, help control erosion and river sedimentation, and help absorb flood waters. 
B.  District Delineation. Protected Rivers as defined under the Rules for Environmental Planning Criteria, adopted by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources pursuant to Section 12-2-8 of Article 1, Chapter 2, Title 12 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, includes any perennial river or water courses with an average annual flow of at least four hundred (400) cubic feet per second. The Ohoopee River through Candler County meets this criteria. A protected river corridor and a protective one hundred-foot natural vegetative buffer, as defined in Georgia Rule 391-3-16, is hereby established along the entire length of this river(s) within the jurisdiction of Candler County. The buffer area is measured horizontally from each river bank, if any, within the City jurisdiction. Under the method prescribed by the Rules for Environmental Planning Criteria, no development or other land disturbing activity will be allowed to occur within the protected river corridor and within a one hundred-foot buffer of the river bank except for the following permitted uses. 
C.  Permitted Uses. No development, or construction, or other land disturbing activity will be allowed to occur within the one hundred (100) foot buffer from the protected river except for the following uses, as long as they do not impair the long term functions of the protected river or the protected river corridor. In addition, the natural vegetative buffer shall be restored as quickly as possible following any land-disturbing activity or construction permitted within the river corridor for these acceptable uses. 
1.  Single-family dwellings, if any underlying zoning district so permits, provided each dwelling is located on a lot with a minimum size as specified by the Candler County Health Department or the underlying zoning district regulations, but shall be the greater of these requirements; however, in any case the lot for each dwelling shall not be less than two (2) acres, not including any area between the river banks; and provided the septic tank drainfield is located outside of the one hundred-foot buffer area. 
2.  Any residential uses existing or under construction prior to the adoption of these local protection ordinances provided the use has an onsite sewage management construction permit issued by the Candler County Health Department prior to the date of adoption of these local protection ordinances. 
3.  Any industrial or commercial uses existing prior to the adoption of these local protection ordinances, providing they do not impair the drinking quality of the river water as defined by the federal Clean Water Act, as amended, and meet all other federal and state environmental rules and regulations. 
4.  Road and utility crossings, and utility locations if no other location is reasonable, providing the construction of these crossings and uses meet the requirements of the Georgia Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975, as amended, or any other state or local requirements, if stricter, protect the integrity of the buffer area to the extent reasonably possible, and are located as far from the river bank as is reasonably possible. 
5.  Timber production and harvesting, providing it is consistent with the best management practices established by the Georgia Forestry Commission, and does not impair the drinking quality of the river water as defined by the federal Clean Water Act, as amended. 
6.  Agricultural production and management, provided it is consistent with the best management practices established by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission or its successor, and all other state and federal laws and regulations, including those promulgated by the Georgia Department of Agriculture; and does not impair the drinking quality of the river water as defined by the federal Clean Water Act, as amended. 
7.  Wildlife and fisheries management activities consistent with the purposes of Section 12-2-8 (as amended) of Article 1, Chapter 2, Title 12 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated (O.C.G.A.). 
8.  Natural water quality treatment or purification. 
9.  Wastewater treatment. 
10.  Recreational usage consistent with the maintenance of a natural vegetative buffer or with river dependent recreation. 
D.  Prohibited Uses. In compliance with the Georgia "Rules for Environmental Planning Criteria," the following uses are prohibited entirely and no permit shall be issued for them. 
1.  Facilities or areas used for the handling, receiving, storing, or disposal of hazardous wastes. 
2.  Hazardous or solid waste landfills. 
3.  Septic tank drainfields within the one hundred-foot buffer area under any circumstance. 
4.  Septic tanks within the one hundred-foot buffer area, except as expressly provided for single-family dwellings which are permitted under and comply with Section 8.30.080.C.1. 
(Ord. of 1-14-19, § 8) 
8.30.090 - Variances. 
When due to a particular hardship or extraordinary circumstance of the property involved which is not easily corrected, it is impractical for an owner or developer to comply with all of the requirements of this chapter, the City of Metter shall be authorized to vary such requirements (under its jurisdiction) only to such extent as to provide fairness to the owner or developer and as to not violate the intent and purposes of this chapter. Such variances shall only be granted in an official public meeting, and the reasons for granting them shall be entered into the minutes of the public meeting. 
(Ord. of 1-14-19, § 9)

Chapter 9.16 - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT ESTABLISHMENTS 
Sections: 

9.16.010 - Purpose and findings. 
A.  Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to regulate certain types of businesses including, but not limited to, adult entertainment establishments, to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses will be curtailed. However, it is recognized that such regulation cannot de facto approach prohibition. Otherwise, a protected form of expression would vanish. As to adult entertainment establishments, this article represents a balancing of competing interests: reduced criminal activity and protection of neighborhoods through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments versus the protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons. 
B.  Findings. Based on the experience of other urban counties and municipalities, including, but not limited to, Atlanta and Fulton County, Georgia; DeKalb County, Georgia; Augusta-Richmond County, Georgia; Indianapolis, Indiana; Athens-Clarke County, Georgia; Marietta, Georgia; Gwinnett County, Georgia; Warner Robins, Georgia; Rome, Georgia; Carrollton, Georgia; and Smyrna, Georgia; which experiences, we believe are relevant to the issues faced by the city of Metter, Georgia, the mayor and city council take note of the notorious and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within our country. Moreover, it is the findings of the mayor and city council that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale or consumption of alcoholic beverages, begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with nudity and alcohol are disorderly conduct, prostitution, and drug trafficking and use. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with nudity and alcohol are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhood; increased expenditures for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order; increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior herein above described; and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas. Therefore, the limitation of nude or partially nude conduct in establishments affects the public welfare; and it is a matter of governmental interest and concern to prevent the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments that allow and/or encourage nudity. Based on these findings, this article is adopted to regulate certain types of businesses and to establish where such activity may or may not be conducted.

Chapter 9.20 - NOISE CONTROL 
Sections: 

9.20.010 - Declaration of policy. 
It is declared to be the policy and purpose of this chapter to assess complaints of noises alleged to exceed the ambient noise levels. 
(Ord. of 6-11-07) 
9.20.020 - Liberal construction. 
This chapter shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate its purposes. 
(Ord. of 6-11-07) 
9.20.030 - Definitions. 
The following words, phrases and terms as used in this chapter shall have the following meanings: 
"Ambient noise level" means the all-encompassing noise level associated with a given environment, being a composite of sounds from all sources, excluding the alleged offensive noise, at the location and approximate time at which a comparison with the alleged offensive noise is to be made. 
"Cumulative period" means an additive period of time composed of individual time segments which may be continuous or interrupted. 
"Decibel" or "dB" means a unit which denotes the ratio between two quantities which are proportional to power; the number of decibels corresponding to the ratio of two amounts of power is ten (10) times the logarithm to the base of ten (10) of this ratio. 
"Hertz" means a unit of measurement of frequency, numerically equal to cycles per second. 
"Impulsive noise" means a noise characterized by brief excursions of sound pressures whose peak levels are very much greater than the ambient noise level, such as might be produced by the impact of a pile driver, punch press or a drop hammer, typically with one second or less duration. 
"Noise level" means the "A" weighed sound pressure level in decibels obtained by using a sound level meter at slow response with a reference pressure of twenty (20) micropascals. The unit of measurement shall be designated as dBA. 
"Person" means a person, firm, association, copartnership, joint venture, corporation or any entity, public or private in nature. 
"Simple tone noise" or "pure tone noise" means a noise characterized by the presence of a predominant frequency or frequencies such as might be produced by whistle or hum. 
"Sound level meter" means an instrument that meets or exceeds American National Standard Institute's Standard S1.4-1971 for Type 2 sound level meters or an instrument and the associated recording and analyzing equipment which will provide equivalent data. 
"Sound pressure level" means a sound pressure level of a sound, in decibels, as defined in ANSI Standards 51.2-1962 and 51.13-1921; that is, twenty (20) times the logarithm to the base ten (10) of the ratio of the pressure of the sound to a reference pressure, which reference pressure shall be 0.0002 dynes per square centimeter. 
(Ord. of 6-11-07) 
9.20.040 - Prohibited generally. 
It shall be unlawful for any person to make, continue, or cause to be made or continued any excessive, unnecessary or unusually loud noise or any noise which either annoys, disturbs, injures or endangers the comfort, repose, health, peace or safety of others, within the limits of the city.

B.  Radios, phonographs, etc. The using, operating, or permitting to be played, used or operated any radio receiving set, musical instrument, phonograph, or other machine or device for the producing or reproducing of sound in such manner as to disturb the peace, quiet and comfort of the neighboring inhabitants or at any time with louder volume than is necessary for convenient hearing for the person or persons who are in the room, vehicle, or chamber in which such machine or device is operated and who are voluntary listeners thereto. The operation of any such set, instrument, phonograph, machine or device in such a manner as to be plainly audible at a distance of fifty (50) feet from the building, structure or vehicle in which it is located shall be prima facie evidence of a violation of this section.

It is unlawful for any person to operate any motorcycle or recreational off-road vehicle on or off a public road in such a manner that the noise level exceeds the exterior noise standards specified in Section 9.20.070 of this chapter. 
(Ord. of 6-11-07) 
9.20.110 - Outdoor recreation activities. 
A.  Outdoor recreational activities involving amplified sound, including but not limited to athletic events, sporting events, entertainment events and concerts, may create excessive noise which is detrimental to the public health, safety, welfare and the peace and quiet of the inhabitants of the city and its environs. 
B.  The city's existing noise regulations, which require extended off-site measurements of the sound rather than measurements at its source, are very cumbersome and expensive to enforce, especially in connection with outdoor recreational activities. 
C.  Limiting sound levels of outdoor activities to ninety (90) dba leq is necessary to protect the public health, safety, welfare and the peace and quiet of the inhabitants of the city. 
D.  Limiting sound levels at the source is content neutral. It helps to avoid the problem of complaints being received, and therefore measurements being made and enforcement undertaken, only in connection with certain kinds of activities, or certain kinds of music, which some people may consider objectionable and not other kinds of activities or music which may be just as loud. 
E.  A variance procedure can be devised to raise the sound limit or modify the time restrictions upon a showing that a facility, because of its design, location or other characteristics, is capable of handling higher sound levels without substantially increasing the likelihood that violations of the other provisions of this chapter will occur. 
F.  It is unlawful for any person to conduct, or permit to be conducted on its property, any outdoor recreational activity, including, but not limited to, entertainment events and concerts at which amplified noise, amplified music, or amplified sound exceeding the following levels is created: ninety (90) dba leq. The noise, music or sound shall be measured at the sound booth or other reasonable location which is not more than one hundred fifty (150) feet from the source. Every person conducting, or permitting to be conducted, on its property, any outdoor recreational activity shall, upon request, permit the City of Metter Police Department, or the chief's designee, to place a sound level monitor (with or without an accompanying staff member) at a location described in this subsection to monitor sound levels.

(4)  If over fifty (50) people attend the event for which the permit to exceed was obtained, adequate private security shall be provided for the purpose of crowd and traffic control. The adequacy of such private security shall be determined by the city police department. 
F.  Limit on permits. Permits to exceed shall be subject to the following limitations: 
(1)  Permits will only be granted for temporary purposes not to exceed eight continuous hours in any one time period; 
(2)  No more than two permits shall be allowed per address (person or group of persons) during any six-month period. January 1 through June 30 shall constitute one six-month period. July 1 through December 31 shall constitute the second six-month period.

I.  Effect of permit revocation. Once the permit to exceed has been revoked, the person or group of persons that obtained the permit shall no longer be exempt from the provisions of this chapter. 
J.  Limitation on Section 9.20.130. The provisions of this section apply only when a person or group of persons has obtained a permit to exceed, and only on the date and during the time period set forth in such permit. The provisions of this chapter apply at all other times.

A variance may be for a limited period and may be subject to any other terms, conditions and requirements as the city council may deem reasonable to achieve maximum compliance with the provisions of this chapter. Such terms, conditions and requirements may include, but shall not be limited to, limitations on noise levels and operating hours. 
D.  Each variance shall set forth the approved method of achieving maximum compliance and a time schedule for its accomplishment. The city council shall consider the magnitude of nuisance caused by the offensive noise, the uses of property within the area of impingement by the noise, the time factors related to study, design, financing and construction of remedial work, the economic factors related to age and useful life of equipment and the general public interest and welfare. 
E.  The city council shall consider all facts relating to whether strict compliance with the requirement of this chapter will cause practical difficulties, unnecessary hardship or unreasonable expense. 
(Ord. of 6-11-07) 
9.20.150 - Violations. 
A.  Upon the receipt of a compliant from any person, the chief of police or their duly authorized representatives may investigate and assess whether the alleged noise levels exceed the noise standards set forth in this chapter. If such officers have reason to believe that any provision(s) of this chapter has been violated, they shall cause a citation to be served upon the alleged violator. Such citation shall specify the provision(s) of this chapter alleged to have been violated and the facts alleged to constitute a violation, including dBA readings noted and the time and place of their detection. Upon conviction, the violation shall constitute a misdemeanor. Each such violation committed or permitted to continue shall constitute a separate offense and shall be punishable as such. 
B.  The administrative penalty for each violation of this chapter shall be five hundred dollars ($500.00) if the violator is an individual and one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) if the violator is a firm, association, copartnership, joint venture, corporation of other entity, public or private in nature.

Chapter 13.32 - GREASE, OIL, AND SAND CONTROL 
Sections: 

13.32.10 - Purpose. 
The purpose of this chapter is to control discharges into the public sewerage collection system and wastewater treatment plant that interfere with the operations of the system, cause blockage and plugging of pipelines, interfere with normal operation of pumps and their controls, and contribute waste of a strength or form that either causes treatment difficulties or is beyond the treatment capability of the wastewater treatment plant. 
(Ord. of 6-11-07, § 1) 
13.32.20 - Definitions. 
[The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:] 
Grease. Material composed primarily of fats, oil, and grease (FOG) from animal or vegetable sources. The terms fats, oil, and, grease shall be deemed as grease by definition. Grease does not include petroleum based products. 
Grease trap. A device for separating and retaining waterborne greases and grease complexes prior to the wastewater exiting the trap and entering the sanitary sewer collection and treatment system. These devices also serve to collect settlable solids, generated by and from food preparation activities, prior to the water exiting the trap and entering the sanitary sewer collection and treatment system. 
Food service establishments. Those establishments primarily engaged in activities of preparing, serving, or otherwise making available for consumption foodstuffs and that use one or more of the following preparation activities: cooking by frying (all methods), baking (all methods), grilling, sauteing, rotisserie cooking, broiling (all methods), boiling, blanching, roasting, toasting, or poaching. Also included are infared heating, searing, barbecuing, and any other food preparation activity that produces a hot, non-drinkable food product in or on a receptacle that requires washing. 
These facilities include restaurants, cafeterias, hotels, motels, hospitals, nursing homes, schools, grocery stores, prisons, jails, churches, camps, caterers, manufacturing plants, or any other sewer users as determined by the city's public works director. 
User. Any person or establishment including those located outside the jurisdictional limits of the city who contributes, causes, or permits the contribution or discharge of wastewater into the city's wastewater collection or treatment system, including persons who contribute such wastewater from mobile sources, such as those who discharge hauled wastewater. 
Oil/water separator. An approved and industry standard system that is specifically designed and manufactured to separate oil from water. The system shall allow the oil to be collected and removed on a regular basis as to prevent it from being discharged into the wastewater collection system. Only oil/water separators manufactured for that specific operation will be approved. Adequate support literature from the manufacturer will be required so as to allow a proper review by the public works director. 
(Ord. of 6-11-07, § 1) 
13.32.30 - General criteria. 
A.  Installation requirements. All existing, proposed, or newly remodeled food service establishments inside the City of Metter wastewater service area shall be required to install, at the user's expense an approved, properly operated and maintained grease trap, except as otherwise provided in this chapter. 
B.  Sanitary sewer flows. Sanitary sewer flows from toilets, urinals, lavatories, etc. shall not be discharged into the grease trap. These flows shall be conveyed separately to the sanitary sewer service lateral. 
C.  Floor drains. Only floor drains which discharge or have the potential to discharge grease shall be connected to a grease trap. 
D.  Garbage grinders/disposers. It is recommended that solid food waste products be disposed of through normal solid waste/garbage disposal means. If a grinder/disposal is used it must be connected to the grease trap. The use of grinders is discouraged since it decreases the operational capacity of the grease trap and will require an increased pumping frequency to ensure continuous and effective operation. 
E.  Dishwashers. Commercial dishwashers must be connected to the grease trap. Dishwashers discharge soap and hot water which can melt grease and allow it to pass through an undersized grease trap. Traps must be sized accordingly to allow enough detention time to allow water to cool and grease to solidify and float to the top of the trap. 
F.  Location. Grease trap shall be installed outside the building upstream from the sanitary sewer service lateral connection. This will allow easy access for inspection, cleaning, and removal of the intercepted grease at any time. A grease trap may not be installed inside any part of a building without written approval of the public works director. 
G.  Pass through limits. No user shall introduce or cause to be introduced into the city's sanitary sewer system any pollutant or wastewater which causes pass through or interference. These general prohibitions apply to all users of the city's waste system whether or not they are subject to categorical pretreatment standards or any other federal, state, or local pretreatment standards or requirements. 
(Ord. of 6-11-07, § 1) 
13.32.40 - Implementation. 
A.  New plumbing systems. Notwithstanding other respectable authority, and unless otherwise exempted in this section, this chapter shall apply to all food service establishments that discharge to the sewers of the city. 
B.  Altered or remodeled plumbing systems. Notwithstanding other respectable authority, all existing food service establishments servicing users other than individual residential users that are altered or remodeled as to the requirements of this chapter, and which discharge into the sewers of the city shall be in compliance with this chapter. 
C.  Existing installations. The city may require, at the user's expense, the installation of exterior or interior grease interceptors for existing plumbing installations where the capacity of the sewer system is reduced due to congealed grease, or where congealed grease otherwise impairs the proper functioning of the sewer system. 
All existing food service establishments, determined by the public works director to have a reasonable potential to adversely impact the city's sewer system will be notified of their obligations to install a grease interceptor within the specified period set forth in the notification letter. 
D.  Variance from requirements. Grease interceptors required under this chapter shall be installed unless the public works director authorizes the installation of an indoor grease trap or other alternative pretreatment technology and determines that the installation of a grease interceptor would not be feasible. The food service establishment bears the burden of demonstrating that the installation of the interceptor is not feasible. The public works director may authorize the installation of an indoor grease trap where the installation of a grease interceptor is not feasible due to space constraints or other considerations. If an establishment believes the installation of a grease interceptor is not feasible, because of documented space constraints, the request for an alternate grease removal device shall contain the following language: 
(1)  Location of sewer main and easement in relation to available exterior space outside building. 
(2)  Existing plumbing at or in a site that uses common plumbing for all services. 
Alternative pretreatment technology includes, but is not limited to, devices that are used to trap, separate and hold grease from wastewater and prevent it from being discharged into the sanitary sewer collection system. All alternative pretreatment technology must the appropriately sized and approved by the public works director. 
(Ord. of 6-11-07, § 1) 
13.32.50 - Design criteria.

B.  Access. Access to grease traps shall be available at all times, to allow for their maintenance and inspection. Access to trap shall be provided by two manholes (one on each compartment) terminating at finished grade with cast iron frame and cover. 
C.  Load-bearing capacity. In areas where additional weight loads may exist, the grease trap shall be designed to have adequate load- bearing capacity. (Example: vehicular traffic in driving or parking areas) 
D.  Inlet and outlet piping. Wastewater discharging to a grease trap shall enter only through the inlet pipe of the trap. Each grease trap shall have only one inlet and one outlet pipe. 
E.  Grease trap sizing. All grease traps shall have a capacity of not less than one thousand (1,000) gallons, nor exceed a capacity of three thousand (3,000) gallons. If the calculated capacity exceeds three thousand (3,000) gallons, multiple units plumbed in series shall be installed. All grease traps shall be designed as to sizing as follows: 
(1)  Restaurants and cafeterias: 
(S) x (GS) x HR/(12) x (LF) = Interceptor capacity, where: 
S = Number of seats in dining area 
GS = Gallons of wastewater per seat (25 gallons per seat) 
HR = Number of hours open 
LR = Loading factor: 
(a) 1.25 = Interstate freeways 
(b) 1.0 = Recreational areas 
(c) 0.8 = Main highways 
(d) 0.5 = Other highways 
(2)  Hospitals, nursing homes, hotels, motels, schools, grocery stores, prisons, jails, churches, camps, caterers, and similar commercial kitchens with varied seating capacity: 
(M) x (GM) x (LF) = Capacity in gallons, where: 
M = Meals per day 
GM = Gallons of wastewater per meal (5 gallons per meal) 
LF = Loading Factor: 
(a) 1.0 = with dishwater 
(b) 0.5 = without dishwater 
13.32.60 - Grease trap maintenance. 
A.  Cleaning/pumping. The user at the user's expense shall maintain all grease traps to assure proper operation and efficiency and maintain compliance with the city's pass through limits. Maintenance of grease trap shall include the complete removal of all contents, including floating materials, wastewater, and bottom sludge and solids. This work shall be performed by a qualified and licensed hauler. 
Decanting or discharging of removed waste back into the trap from which it was removed or any other grease trap, for the purpose of reducing the volume to be disposed, is prohibited. This service shall also include a thorough inspection of the trap and its components. Any needed repairs shall be noted. Repairs shall be made at user's expense. 
B.  Cleaning/pumping frequency. The grease trap must be pumped out completely a minimum of once every four months, or more frequently, as determined by the public works director, as needed to prevent carry over of grease into the sanitary sewer system. 
C.  Disposal. All waste removed from each grease trap must be disposed of at a facility approved to receive such waste in accordance with the provisions of this program. In no way shall the pumpage be returned to any private or public portion of the city's sanitary sewer collection system. 
All pumpage from grease traps must be tracked by a manifest, which confirms pumping, hauling, and disposal of waste. The customer must obtain and retain a copy of the original manifest from the hauler and provide a copy of the same to the public works director after each pump. 
D.  Maintenance log. A grease trap cleaning/maintenance log indicating each pumping for the previous twenty-four (24) months shall be maintained by each food service facility.

(Ord. 2010-08) 
15.36.020 - Findings of fact. 
(1)  The flood hazard areas of Metter, Georgia are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(2)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
(Ord. 2010-08) 
15.36.030 - Statement of purpose. 
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
(3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; and 
(4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; 
(5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters. 
(Ord. 2010-08) 
15.36.040 - Objectives. 
The objectives of this chapter are: 
(1)  To protect human life and health; 
(2)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(3)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; 
(4)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(5)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(6)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; and 
(7)  To insure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

(B)  The appeals board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the building official in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. 
(C)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the building official may appeal such decision to the Superior Court of Candler County, as provided in OCGA § 5-4-1. 
(D)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(E)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
(F)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(G)  In reviewing such requests, the appeals board shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this chapter. 
(H)  Conditions for variances: 
(1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
i.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
ii.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
iii.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(2)  The provisions of this chapter are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
(3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(4)  The building official shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
(I)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this chapter, the appeals board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

5.  Towers shall be the minimum height necessary to provide parity with existing similar tower supported antenna, and shall be freestanding where the negative visual effect is less than would be created by use of a guyed tower. 
G.  Landscaping. Landscaping shall be used to effectively screen the view of the tower compound from adjacent public ways, public property and residential property and shall be as follows: 
1.  For towers one hundred fifty (150) feet tall or less, a buffer area no less than six feet wide shall commence at the property line. 
2.  For towers more than one hundred fifty (150) feet tall, a buffer area not less than ten (10) feet wide shall be provided at the property line. 
3.  The buffer zone is to consist of materials of a variety which can be expected to grow to form a continuous hedge at least five feet in height within two years of planting. 
4.  Trees and shrubs in the vicinity of guy wires shall be of a kind that would not exceed twenty (20) feet in height or would not affect the stability of the guys, should they be uprooted, and shall not obscure visibility of the anchor from the transmission building or security facilities and staff/maintenance. 
5.  Native vegetation on the site shall be preserved to the greatest practical extent. The applicant shall provide a site plan showing existing significant vegetation to be removed, and vegetation to be replanted to replace that lost. 
6.  In lieu of these standards, the director may allow use of an alternate detailed plan and specifications for landscape and screening, including plantings, fences, walls and other features designed to screen and buffer towers and accessory uses. The plan shall accomplish the same degree of screening achieved by the provisions of this section, except as lesser requirements are desirable for adequate visibility for security purposes and/or for continued operation of existing bona fide agricultural or forest uses such as farms, nurseries and tree farms. In certain locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, such as remote agricultural or rural locations or developed heavy industrial areas, the landscaping requirement may be reduced or waived by the director. 
H.  Maintenance Impacts and Parking Requirements. Equipment at a transmission facility shall be automated to the greatest extent possible to reduce traffic and congestion. Where the site abuts or has access to a collector and local street, access for maintenance vehicles shall be exclusively by means of the collector street. A minimum of two parking spaces shall be provided on each site; an additional parking space for each two employees shall be provided at facilities which require on-site personnel. 
I.  Principal, Accessory and Joint Uses. 
1.  Accessory structures used in direct support of a tower shall be allowed but not be used for offices, vehicles storage or other outdoor storage. Mobile or immobile equipment not used in direct support of a tower facility shall not be stored or parked on the site of the tower, unless repairs to the tower are being made. 
2.  Towers may be located on sites containing another principal uses in the same buildable area. As long as all of the other siting, setback, separation and general requirements of this chapter are met, towers may occupy a parcel meeting the minimum lot size requirements for the zoning district in which it is located. The minimum distance between a tower and other principal use located on the same lot shall be for a monopole or lattice tower the greater of twenty (20) percent of the tower height or twenty-five (25) feet and for a guy tower the greater of one hundred (100) breakpoint or twenty-five (25) feet. This separation is required to assure compatibility of land uses and to provide for the health, safety and welfare of individuals and structures occupying the same site. 
3.  Joint use of a site is prohibited when a proposed or existing principal use includes the storage, distribution or sale of volatile, flammable, explosive or hazardous materials such as propane, gasoline, natural gas and dangerous chemicals. 
J.  Tower Lot Size, Setbacks and Separation. 
1.  The site shall be of a size and shape sufficient to provide an adequate setback from the base of the tower to any property line abutting a residential district, public property or public street. Such setback shall be sufficient to: 
a.  Provide for an adequate vegetative, topographic or other buffer as required in Section 15.40.040 (F) and (G); 
b.  Preserve the privacy of surrounding residential property; 
c.  Protect adjoining property from the potential impact of tower failure by being large enough to accommodate such failure on the site, based on the engineer's analysis required in Section 15.40.060. 
2.  A site is presumed to be of sufficient size when it: 
a.  Meets the requirements of the subsection (J)(1) of this section; 
b.  Provides a setback equal to two times the height of the tower failure by being large enough to accommodate such failure on the site, based on the engineer's analysis required in Section 15.40.060; 
c.  Provides a setback equal to or exceeding the rear yard setback required for the adjoining property where the adjoining property is not in a residential district nor a public property or a public street. 
3.  Placement of more than one tower on a lot shall be permitted; provided, all setback, design and landscape requirements are met as to each tower. Structures may be located as close to each other as technically feasible; provided, tower failure characteristics of the towers on the site will not lead to multiple failures in the event that one fails. 
4.  For a guyed structure, the site shall be of a size and shape sufficient to provide a setback equal to at least the height of the tower from a guy anchor to any property line abutting a residential district, public property or public street in addition to the size required to comply with subsection (J)(2) of this section. Such setback shall be adequate to provide a vegetative, topographic or other buffer sufficient to obscure view to the anchor from such adjoining properties. 
5.  All structures and uses associated with the transmission use other than the transmission tower shall be located to meet the setbacks required in the zoning district where the tower is to be located. To encourage and accommodate shared use of a tower, the director may waive or reduce setback requirements by up to twenty-five (25) percent to accommodate the placement of additional buildings or other supporting equipment at a tower site. 
6.  No freestanding communication tower shall be allowed within a five thousand (5,000) foot radius of an existing tower within a residential area. 
7.  In no case shall a tower be located in the required front yard of a residential district. 
8.  All freestanding towers constructed after April 12, 1999, shall conform to the following minimum tower separation requirements: 

 
Towers and antennas mounted on rooftops or alternative tower structures shall be exempt from these minimum separation distances. 
K.  Be it ordained that the passage of the ordinance codified in this chapter also includes the adoption of Part 77 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and that all placement of towers and antenna must be approved by the FAA before a building permit or placement is allowed. This approval is generally granted by the completion of form "FAA Form 7460-1" or its equivalent. 
(Ord. 99-14 (part)) 
15.40.050 - Shared use. 
All new towers shall be designed to structurally accommodate the maximum number of additional users technically practicable. 
A.  1. Once a new tower is approved, additional antennas and accompanying accessory uses may be added to it in accordance with the approved share plan if the director finds that the standards of this chapter are met; or 
2.  To encourage shared use of towers, no building permit or special use permit shall be required for the addition of antenna(e) to an existing tower so long as the height of the tower or structure on which the antenna is placed is not increased and the requirements of Sections 15.40.030(B) and 15.40.040 are met. 
B.  If a new tower is approved, the owner shall be required as conditions of approval, to: 
1.  Record the letter of intent required by Section 15.40.060(J) in miscellaneous deed records of the office of the county clerk of superior court where the tower site is located; 
2.  Respond in a timely, comprehensive manner to a request for information from a potential shared use applicant; 
3.  Negotiate in good faith for shared use by third parties; and 
4.  Allow shared use where the third party seeking such agrees in writing to pay reasonable, pro rata charges for sharing, including all charges necessary to modify the tower and transmitters to accommodate shared use, but not total tower reconstruction, and to observe whatever technical requirements are necessary to allow shared use without creating interference. 
C.  Wilful, knowing failure of an owner whose tower was approved after the effective date of this chapter, to comply with the requirement of subsections (B)(1) through (B)(4) shall be grounds for withholding approval of any application by such owner for a building permit or special use permit for any tower or antenna. 
D.  Such conditions shall run with the land and be binding on subsequent purchasers of the tower site. 
(Ord. 99-14 (part)) 
15.40.060 - Conditional zoning. 
A.  A request for a conditional zoning shall be initiated by application to the director and handled in accordance with the conditional zoning provision of Article XII, Board of Zoning Appeals, in the zoning regulations. The city council may grant a conditional zoning under this section; provided, it shall have determined that all of the general requirements of Section 15.40.040 have been satisfied and, further, that the benefits of and need for the proposed tower are greater than any possible depreciating effects and damage to the neighboring properties. 
B.  In granting a conditional zoning, the city council may impose additional zoning conditions to the extent determined necessary to buffer or otherwise minimize adverse effects of the proposed tower or antenna on surrounding properties. 
(Ord. 99-14 (part), 1999) 
15.40.070 - Application procedures. 
Application for a building permit for any communication tower or use of an alternative tower structure shall be made to the director. An application will not be considered until it is complete. A complete application must contain the following: 
A.  Inventory of Existing Sites. An inventory of the applicant's existing towers that are either within the jurisdiction of the governing authority or within one mile of the border thereof, including specific information about the location, height and design of each tower.

The director shall approve those limitations if they cannot be overcome by reasonable technical means; 
M.  Evidence of the lack of space on all suitable existing towers to locate the proposed antenna and of the lack of space on existing tower sites to construct a tower for the proposed antenna; 
N.  Each applicant must make a good faith effort to substantially demonstrate that no existing or planned towers can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna/transmitter as described below: 
1.  The applicant shall contact the owners of all existing or planned towers of a height roughly equal to or greater than the height of the tower proposed by the applicant. A list shall be provided of all owners contacted, the date of such contact, and the form and content of such contact, 
2.  Such contact shall be made in a timely manner, that is, sufficiently before the filing of an application for a building or conditional zoning to include a response into the application when filed. 
a.  Failure of a listed owner to respond shall not be relevant if a timely, good faith effort was made to obtain one. However, where an existing or planned tower is known to have capacity for additional antennas of the sort proposed, based on the decision regarding such tower, that application for a new tower shall not be complete until the owner of the existing or planned tower responds. Such response is to be required as a condition of approval; 
b.  The director shall maintain and provide, on request, records of responses from each tower, 
c.  Once an owner demonstrates an antenna of the sort proposed by the applicant cannot be accommodated on the owner's tower as described below, the owner need not be contacted by future applicants for antennas of the sort proposed; 
3.  The applicant shall request the following information from each tower contacted: 
a.  Identification of the site by location, tax lot number, existing uses and tower height, 
b.  Whether each such tower could structurally accommodate the antenna proposed by the applicant without requiring structural changes be made to the tower. To enable the owner to respond, the applicant shall provide each such owner with the height, length, weight, and other relevant data about the proposed antenna, 
c.  Whether each such tower could structurally accommodate the proposed antenna if structural changes were made, not including totally rebuilding the tower. If so, the owner shall specify in general terms what structural changes would be required, 
d.  If structurally able, would shared use by such existing tower be precluded for reasons related to RF interference. If so, the owner shall describe in general terms what changes in either the existing or proposed antenna would be required to accommodate the proposed tower, if at all, 
e.  If shared use is possible, the fee an owner of an existing tower would charge for such shared use; 
4.  Shared use is not precluded simply because a reasonable fee for shared use is charged, or because of reasonable costs necessary to adopt the existing and proposed uses to a shared tower. The director and the governing body may consider expert testimony to determine whether the fee and costs are reasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development are presumed unreasonable; 
O.  Any other information which may be requested by the director to fully evaluate and review the application and the potential impact of a proposed tower and/or antenna.

2. Granite quarrying and land clearing for such quarrying; 
3. Such minor land disturbing activities as home gardens and individual home landscaping, repairs, maintenance work, fences, and other related activities which result in minor soil erosion; 
4. The construction of single-family residences, when such construction disturbs less than one acre and is not part of a larger common plan of development or sale with a planned disturbance of equal to or greater than one acre and not otherwise exempted under this subsection; provided, however, that construction of any such residence shall conform to the minimum requirements as of any such residence shall conform to the minimum requirements as set forth in Section 15.44.040 and this subsection. For single-family residence construction covered by the provisions of this subsection, there shall be a buffer zone between the residence and any state waters classified as trout streams pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5, of the Georgia Water Quality Control Act. In any such buffer zone, no land disturbing activity shall be constructed between the residence and the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action from the banks of the trout waters. For primary trout waters, the buffer zone shall be at least fifty (50) horizontal feet, and no variance to a smaller buffer shall be granted.

15.44.040 - Minimum requirements for the erosion and sedimentation control using best management practices. 
A.  General Provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land disturbing activities. Therefore, plans for those land disturbing activities, which are not excluded by this chapter shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion and sedimentation control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion and sedimentation control plans. Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections (B) and (C) of this section. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion and sedimentation pollution during all stages of any land disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this chapter and the NPDES general permit. 
B.  Minimum Requirements. 
1.  Best management practices as set forth in this section shall be required for all land disturbing activities. Proper design, installation and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with subsection (B)(2) of this section or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to subsection (f) of Code Section 12-5-30, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act. As used in this subsection, the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in OCGA 12-7-6 subsection (b). 
2.  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to subsection (f) of Code Section 12-5-30, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than twenty-five (25) nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten (10) nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This subsection shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
3.  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to subsection (f) Code Section 12-5-30, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, for each day on which such failure occurs. 
4.  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
C.  The rules and regulations, ordinances or resolutions adopted pursuant to this chapter for the purpose of governing land disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia, published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1st of the year in which the land disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following. 
1.  Stripping of vegetation, regarding and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
2.  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
3.  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practical erosion potential; 
4.  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
5.  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
6.  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
7.  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
8.  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
9.  To the extent necessary, sediment in runoff water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this subsection, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of OCGA 12-7-1 et seq. 
10.  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
11.  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
12.  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
13.  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means or bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
14.  Land disturbing activity plans for erosion and sedimentation control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection (B)(2) of this section; 
15.  Except as provided in subsection (C)(16) of this section, there is established a twenty-five (25) foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to OCGA 12-2-8, or where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers are at least twenty-five (25) feet established pursuant to Part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act" shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this subsection. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
a.  No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructed a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within twenty-five (25) degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than fifty (50) feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
i.  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
ii.  Stream crossings for sewer lines; 
16.  There is established a fifty (50) foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of twenty-five (25) gallons per minute or less shall have a twenty-five (25) foot buffer or they may be paid, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer with the requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance form such buffer to allow land disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer; 
a.  No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within twenty-five (25) degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than fifty (50) feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
i.  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
ii.  Stream crossings for sewer lines. 
c.  Nothing contained in this chapter shall prevent a local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances or resolutions, which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections (A) and (B) of this section. 
d.  The fact that land disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this chapter or the terms of the permit. 
(Amendment dated 8-9-10: amendment dated 6-14-04 (part)) 
15.44.050 - Application/permit process. 
A.  General.

Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection (C) of this section. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of Sections 15.44.040(B) and (C) will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by four copies of the applicant's soil erosion and sedimentation control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan or that such a visit was not required in accordance with rules and regulations established by the board. 
3.  A fee, in the amount of seventy-five dollars ($75.00) shall be charged for the first five acres or less. An additional five dollars ($5.00) per acre will be charged for the remaining acres in the project area. 
4.  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to paragraph (5) subsection (a) of OCGA 12-5-23, provided that such fees shall not exceed eighty dollars ($80.00) per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to subsection (a) of OCGA 12-7-8 half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to paragraph (9) or (10) of OCGA 12-7-17 shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
5.  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion and sedimentation control plan. A district shall approve or disapprove a plan within thirty-five (35) days of receipt. Failure of a district to act within thirty-five (35) days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by Sections 15.44.040(B)(15) and (B)(16) and bonding, if required as per Section 15.44.040(B)(5)(b), have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. 
6.  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended within three years prior to the date of filing of the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
7.  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, three thousand dollars ($3,000.00) per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this chapter or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations.

(Amendment dated 8-9-10: amendment dated 6-14-04 (part)) 
15.44.060 - Inspection and enforcement. 
A.  The building inspector working under the public works department will periodically inspect the sites of land disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If through inspection it is deemed that a person engaged in land disturbing activities as defined in this chapter has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this chapter, a written notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this chapter. 
B.  The public works department shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this chapter, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land disturbing activities. 
C.  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who represents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the purpose of carrying out his official duties. 
D.  The districts or the commission or both shall periodically review the actions of municipalities, which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to OCGA 12-7-8(a). The districts or the commission on both may provide technical assistance to any municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the municipality's erosion and sedimentation control program. The districts or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
E.  The board, on or before December 31, 2003, shall promulgate rules and regulations setting forth the requirements and standards for certification and the procedures for decertification of a local issuing authority. The division may periodically review the actions of municipalities, which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to OCGA 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinances and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any municipality certified pursuant to OCGA 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to OCGA 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the municipality in writing. The governing authority of any municipality so notified shall have thirty (30) days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the municipality does not take necessary corrective action within thirty (30) days after notification by the division, the division may revoke the certification of the municipality as a local issuing authority.

B.  Stop-Work Orders. For the first and second violations of the provisions of this chapter, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have five days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within five days, the director of the local issuing authority shall issue a stop-work order requiring that land disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided, however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the director or local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order in lieu of a warning: 
1.  For a third and each subsequent violation, the director or local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order; 
2.  All stop-work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; and 
3.  When a violation in the form of taking action without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer, or significant amounts of sediment, as determined by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee, have been or are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained, a stop work order shall be issued by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee. All such stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop work orders shall apply to all land-disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls. 
C.  Bond Forfeiture. If through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land disturbing activities has failed to comply with the approved plan, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this chapter and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to have forfeited his performance bond, if required to post one under the provisions of Section 15.44.050(B)(5)(b). The local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. 
D.  Monetary Penalties. 
1.  Any person who violates any provisions of this chapter, or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant to this chapter, or who negligently or intentionally fails or refuses to comply with any final or emergency order of the director issued as provided in this chapter shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) per day. For the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this chapter, notwithstanding any provisions in any city charter to the contrary, municipal courts shall be authorized to impose a penalty not to exceed two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) per violation.

Title 18 - DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS 
Chapters: 

 
Chapter 18.04 - GENERAL PROVISIONS 
Sections: 

18.04.010 - Title. 
This title shall be known and may be cited as the "Development Agreement Ordinance" of the City of Metter. 
(Ord. 08-01) 
18.04.020 - Findings. 
The need for a development agreement arises in instances where a landowner generally wishes to guarantee that a local government's land use regulations will remain fixed during the life of a prospective land development on a subject parcel. The local government, on the other hand, seeks as many concessions and land development conditions as possible beyond what it could reasonably require through subdivision regulations under the normal exercise of its authority or police power. 
Developers have an incentive to voluntarily enter into a development agreement with the city that will limit the property use(s), because the prospects exist that the local government will adopt and apply land use restrictions to said property in the future. Hence, a development agreement would benefit a developer by locking in the development regulations that apply to a particular development, even if the local government subsequently adopts land use regulations. 
Developers also have an incentive to voluntarily enter into a development agreement with the city for two other important reasons, even if no land use regulations currently apply to a proposed development. First, the developer may need the cooperation of the city in extending infrastructure (e.g., water and sewer lines, drainage facilities, roads, utilities, etc.), and such cooperation may not be forthcoming in the absence of concessions voluntarily submitted to by the developer in the form of a development agreement. Second, knowledge of a pending development may stir citizen controversy, and even if the city has no land use regulations, the development agreement becomes a flexible negotiating instrument whereby the developer can submit to certain concessions (i.e., limits on land uses) that will satisfy neighborhood concerns. 
The city similarly has interests in voluntarily entering into a development agreement in certain instances. As just noted, the city may have an interest in limiting land uses in a given area because of citizen opposition. Without the mechanism of a voluntary development agreement and in the absence of land use regulations, the city has virtually no control over the quality, extent, and location of a proposed development. The city will also support entering into development agreements in cases where infrastructure is needed to serve the development but no existing regulation exists to require such improvements. 
The mayor and city council of the City of Metter, Georgia, therefore finds that a negotiated development agreement, voluntarily submitted by a development applicant and involving infrastructure improvements and limits on land use regulations, can be in the best interests of the city and the development community and within the proper scope of the city's police powers. 
(Ord. 08-01) 
18.04.030 - Purpose. 
The purpose of a development agreement is to vest certain development rights in the landowner/developer in exchange for construction and dedication of public improvements, certain restrictions on land uses, and other concessions on the part of developer. A development agreement allows a developer who needs additional discretionary approval now or in the future to acquire long-term project approval, regardless of any local regulations that may be subsequently adopted. Development agreements will provide assurances to the applicant for a particular development project, that upon approval of the project, the applicant may proceed with the project in accordance with all applicable local statues, ordinances, resolutions, rules, and policies in existence at the time the development agreement is executed and that the project will not be restricted or prohibited by the city's subsequent enactment or adoption of laws, ordinances, resolutions, rules, or policies. Public benefits derived from development agreements may include, but are not limited to, restrictions on land uses, limits on development intensity and location, affordable housing, design standards, and on- and off-site infrastructure and other improvements. The local government needs a mechanism for negotiating such benefits in return for the vesting of development rights for a specific period. It is therefore the specific purpose of this chapter to authorize the local governing body to exercise its police powers to enter into individual development agreements and to specify the content and procedures for such development agreements. 
(Ord. 08-01) 
18.04.040 - Authority to enter into development agreements. 
The mayor and city council of the City of Metter, Georgia, hereby exercises its police powers to negotiate and enter into a voluntary development agreement upon application of a developer. The procedure for entering into a development agreement, and the contents of any development agreement, shall be consistent with the requirements of this title. 
(Ord. 08-01) 
18.04.050 - Application.

F.  Recitation of benefits and burdens. The agreement shall recite the benefits each party expects to gain from entering into the agreement, as well as the burdens each party agrees to bear. Because the agreement will be treated as a contract, the consideration each party is to receive from the other should be stated clearly in order to ensure enforceability.

The agreement should specify precisely which regulations will apply to the project regardless of future changes, or otherwise be affected by the agreement. The statement shall clearly state that regulations not specifically so identified will not be affected by the terms of the agreement, and will be subject to enforcement and change under the same criteria that would apply if no agreement were in effect. The development agreement shall specify that, unless otherwise provided by the development agreement rules, regulations, official policies governing permitted uses of the land, governing density, governing design, improvement and construction standards and specifications applicable to the development of the property subject to a development agreement, shall be those rules, regulations, and official policies in force at the time of execution of the agreement. The agreement should also specify that the city hereby agrees that it will accept from the property owner for processing and review all development applications for development permits or other entitlements for the use of the real property in accordance with this agreement, provided that said applications are submitted in accordance with city rules and regulations and fees, if any, have been paid.

M.  Utility connections. All water and sewer service, either to be provided by the developer or by the local government, shall be described in detail, together with schedules of construction completion, cost allocation (between or among developers and government and later developers), hookup or connection schedules, and parameters for permitting, including fees for utility provision and service.

It should also specify project commencement and completion dates, either for the project on the whole, or for its various phases. The agreement should specify that the termination date can be extended by mutual agreement, and that commencement and completion dates may also be extended. 
O.  Amendments and termination. The development agreement shall provide that it may be amended, or canceled in whole or in part, by mutual consent of the parties to the agreement or their successor in interest. The agreement shall include the conditions under which the agreement can be amended, canceled, or otherwise terminated. The agreement shall specifically include that in the event that state or federal laws or regulations, enacted after a development agreement has been entered into, prevent or preclude compliance with one or more provisions of the development agreement, such provisions of the agreement shall be modified or suspended as may be necessary to comply with such state or federal laws or regulations. The development agreement shall also specifically state that if the local government finds and determines, on the basis of substantial evidence, that the applicant or successor in interest thereto has not complied in good faith with the terms or conditions of the agreement, the local government may terminate or modify the agreement. 
P.  Periodic review. The agreement should provide for periodic reviews of the project in order to determine compliance with the terms of the agreement. Unless otherwise negotiated, the city building official shall be responsible for performing such reviews.

1.  Assure that the proposed change is reasonable and consistent with the spirit, purpose, and intent of the zoning ordinance. 
2.  Consider the changes in community characteristics, which may take place because of the proposed change, and consider the consistency with and effect of the change on current public growth and development policies and plans. 
3.  Consider the relative effectiveness or ineffectiveness of the present wording or districting of the ordinance, and whether a justification for change exists because of special reasons or a change in conditions. 
4.  Consider the effect upon the public interest of granting or denying the proposed change and determine that the change will serve the best interests of the city, as compared to any hardship imposed upon the individual property owner. 
5.  Consider the existing land use pattern, and specifically the presence or absence in the adjacent surrounding area of conditions and uses which are the same or similar in character to any proposed change or use, and the possible creation of an isolated district unrelated to adjacent districts. 
6.  Determine that the proposed change will not substantially injure or detract from the use or value of neighboring property, or from the general character of adjacent and nearby property in the surrounding area. 
7.  Consider the unique characteristics of the property involved, and whether the property to be affected by the zoning proposal has some reasonable economic use as currently zoned or whether there are substantial reasons why the property cannot be used in accordance with existing zoning. 
8.  Consider the effect of the proposed change upon the logical, efficient, and economical extensions of public services and facilities, or possible overtaxing or burdening of existing public services or facilities, including but not limited to utilities, streets, schools, and public safety services, and also the associated costs to the local government in providing, improving, increasing, or maintaining such facilities and services. 
9.  Consider the impact of the change with respect to probable effects upon highway traffic and safety, and especially access near intersections. 
10.  Consider the impact of the proposed change upon the environment, including but not limited to drainage, soil erosion and sedimentation, flooding, noise, air quality, and water quality and quantity. 
11.  Determine that the zoning proposal will permit suitable use or uses in view of the subject property's physical characteristics, the use and development of adjacent and nearby properties, existing zoning patterns, existing or proposed public facilities or services, environmental impacts, and current public growth and development policies and plans of the city. 
12.  Consider whether the change is designed to correct an improper situation or would merely result in the granting of special privileges not available to adjacent or surrounding properties. 
13.  Consider any other factors relevant to balancing the city's interests in promoting and protecting the public health, safety, morality, or general welfare against a right to unrestricted use of property.
