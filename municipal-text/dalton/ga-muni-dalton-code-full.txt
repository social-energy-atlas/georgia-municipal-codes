PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Dalton, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1983 Code, as supplemented through December 19, 1994, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the mayor and council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1983 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Milton E. Lefkoff, Senior Code Attorney, and Jody Wilson, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project.

The word "pave" shall include storm drainings, paving, macadamizing and grading. 
"Frontage" means the side or sides of the lot or parcel of land in question abutting on the improvement. 
The word "cost" shall, in addition to the cost and expense of material and labor, or the contract price of any improvement, include all engineering and inspection costs, the costs of moving utilities, and a proper proportion of the salaries and expenses of the engineering staff of the city while such staff is engaged on said improvement, whether such improvement be made by the city with its own forces or under contract with an independent contractor.

Sec. 10-2. - Authority to improve streets and public places, assess costs thereof. 
The City of Dalton is hereby authorized and empowered, when deemed necessary by the mayor and council of said city, or upon petition of property owners as hereinafter set out, to improve its streets, avenues, public alleys, sidewalks and other public places or ways, using such material and doing the same in such manner and to such extent as in the discretion of the mayor and council of said city seems proper and necessary, assessing the cost thereof against the real estate abutting upon such improvements, and against railroad or street-railroad companies, if any, having a track lying in or along the street improved. The cost of so improving the roadway or street proper (except street intersections and the cost assessed against railroad companies) is to be assessed against the real estate abutting on each side of such street to be so improved (except that paid by the city as provided herein); and the cost of paving between railroad tracks and two (2) feet on each side thereof is to be assessed against said companies as hereinafter set forth; and the entire cost of improving the sidewalks and constructing curbs, gutters and lateral drains (except cost assessed against railroad companies) is to be assessed against the real estate on the side of the street where said sidewalk, curb, gutter or lateral drain is constructed. 
(1923 Ga. Laws, page 593, § 3; 1959 Ga. Laws, page 2325, § 1) 
Sec. 10-3. - Petition for improvement; execution, contents; filing, checking improvement. 
In each case where the cost of improving the roadway or street proper is assessed against the abutting property and railroad companies, if any, without the city paying any portion thereof except for street intersections, the proceedings for such improvements shall be begun by petition to the mayor and council of said city, signed by the owners of more than fifty (50) percent of the property abutting on the street or streets or portions of street or streets proposed to be improved. For the purpose of said petition, a holder of land under bond for title or similar instrument, a grantor in a security deed, and a fiduciary with power of sale shall be held to be the "owner." A tenant in common may sign as the "owner" of frontage in proportion to his undivided interest. In determining the amount of property abutting on a street, the frontage in lineal feet shall govern; and in figuring said total frontage, areas lying within intersecting streets shall not be counted. Railroad companies having tracks lying on or along any street to be improved, and which may be required to pay a portion of the cost of such improvement as in this act provided, shall not be parties to said petition, though said companies shall have the right to appear at any hearing of said petition and oppose said improvement; nor, for the purpose of determining whether owners of the required amount of property have signed said petition, shall the tracks of [or] rights-of-way of said companies be counted. 
Said petition shall set forth the general character of improvement requested, the frontage of the property of each signer abutting on the street petitioned to be improved, and the location and extent of the desired improvement. 
The petition shall then be filed with the city clerk; and the city engineer, or his assistants shall carefully check said petition and determine whether the same has been signed by owners of more than fifty (50) percent of such frontage; and the certificate of said city engineer, showing that the petition has been signed by owners of the requisite amount of frontage, shall be prima facie evidence of the fact.

Sec. 10-4. - Ordinance providing for improvement, assessment therefor; contents, advertisement; hearing on ordinance; contesting improvement; scope of section. 
Upon certification of said petition by the city engineer, and if the mayor and council determines such improvement should be made, or upon a determination by said mayor and council that certain street improvements are deemed necessary, an ordinance shall be introduced and read at a regular meeting of said mayor and council, which ordinance shall provide for the making of such improvements and the assessment generally against the abutting property and against railroad companies, if any, having track or tracks in or along said street, of the cost of such improvement; said ordinance describing the general character of the improvement and the general character of the materials to be used, and making reference for more details to specifications or plans in the office of the city engineer. 
Before said ordinance is read a second time and adopted, an advertisement shall be inserted by the city clerk in any newspaper in said city, such advertisement giving notice of the introduction of said ordinance, the location and general character of the proposed improvement, the general character of the material proposed to be used, and the estimated approximate cost to abutting property owners per front foot. Said advertisement shall be publicized at least ten (10) days before the date when said ordinance will be considered by the mayor and council for final passage and adoption. Said advertisement shall further state that the property owners or others interested are notified to appear at the meeting of the mayor and council, giving the time and place thereof, when said ordinance shall be considered by the mayor and council for final passage and adoption. 
At said time named in said advertisement, if any property owner or other person desires to make objection to the passage of such ordinance, full opportunity shall be given at said meeting. After such hearing the mayor and council may, in its judgment, after a second reading of said ordinance, adopt and publish the same, as provided in cases of other ordinances of said city. A statement in or at the bottom of said ordinance, over the signature of the city clerk, or any other certificate of said city clerk, that said notice and opportunity for a hearing was duly given, shall be prima facie evidence of that fact. 
After the passage of said ordinance all property owners assessed for the cost of said improvement, and all railroad companies, who do not within thirty (30) days after such passage commence legal proceedings to prevent such improvement and the appointment [apportionment] of the cost thereof shall be conclusively presumed to have accepted the terms of said ordinance; and after the expiration of said thirty (30) days it shall also be conclusively presumed that owners of the requisite amount of abutting property signed said petition. There upon said improvement shall be made in substantial accordance with the general plans and specifications referred to in said ordinance. 
The provisions of this section relating to assessments for the cost of improving the roadway or street proper, shall be followed also in cases of assessments for other street improvements, when the amount assessed for such other improvements is used as a basis for the issuance of "street improvement bonds," as hereinafter set forth in this act.

Sec. 10-5. - Number of streets, parts thereof included in one petition or ordinance. 
Any number of streets or parts of streets may be included in one petition or ordinance and shall be considered as one improvement; but any objection to an improvement shall be made to each street separately. When an improvement is requested as above, the mayor and council shall have the discretion to provide for the entire improvement requested, or a part thereof, or refuse the request altogether. 
(1923 Ga. Laws, page 593, § 5; 1959 Ga. Laws, page 2325, § 1) 
Sec. 10-6. - Providing for improvement where petition not necessary; assessment limited; contents of ordinance. 
Whenever the City of Dalton[,] by its mayor and council, shall deem it necessary to make street improvements as hereinbefore provided, where no petition of property owners is necessary, the cost of such improvements shall be assessed by the mayor and council against the real estate abutting on each side of the street to be so improved; provided, that one-third ( 1/3 ) of the cost shall be borne by said city. Where an assessment is made against railroad companies, the amount of such assessment is to be deducted from the total cost, and the remainder is to be prorated granted [sic] against abutting property and the city as above. The entire cost of grading, paving or otherwise improving sidewalks, curbs and gutters (except cost charged against railroad companies) shall be assessed against the real estate abutting on the side of the street on which said sidewalk, curbs or gutters are improved or constructed. 
The ordinance providing for the work and making the general assessment shall describe merely the general character of the improvement and the general character of the materials to be used, making reference for more details to specifications or plans in the office of the city engineer or clerk of the City of Dalton.

Sec. 10-7. - Proration, assessment of cost according to frontage and to benefit accruing. 
The cost of street improvements made by said city under this act shall be prorated and assessed against the abutting real estate according to its frontage on the street or portion of street improved, and also according to the special benefit accruing to said property by reason of such improvement; provided further that the cost of such paving or improvement for such portion of such street so improved as shall front on cross or intersecting streets to the one being improved shall be assessed to and paid by the city.

Sec. 10-8. - Duty to pave, improve right-of-way of railroad, street-railroad with tracks in streets; authority of city. 
Any railroad or street-railroad company now having or that may hereafter have tracks running through or across the streets or street intersections of said city shall be required to macadamize or otherwise improve, as said mayor and council may direct, the width of such track and for a space of two (2) feet on each side of every line of track now in use or that may hereafter be constructed by such company, so as to conform to the general character of such improvement being done contiguous to such track; and said railroad or street-railroad company shall, upon direction of said mayor or council, cause the grade of such track to be raised or lowered so as to conform to the grade of the proposed improvement; the mayor and council being authorized, in its discretion, to improve or contract directly for the improvement of the whole surface of the street or portion of the street determined upon; and to require any such company having or using tracks in such street or portion of such street to pay for the improving of the space therein which such company may be required to improve under this act; the object of this provision being to allow the city to improve or contract for the improving of the whole surface of the street, without giving such railroad company or street-railroad company the option of improving the space to be improved by it, by itself or by a contractor at its instance. The words "railroad company," as used throughout this act, shall include street-railroad company. 
(1923 Ga. Laws, page 593, § 8; 1959 Ga. Laws, page 2325, § 1) 
Sec. 10-9. - Procedure for assessing for improvements. 
The following procedure shall be substantially followed, and the following provisions shall apply, in cases of assessments for street improvement under ordinances hereafter adopted, whether such improvements and assessments be made by the mayor and council upon petition of property owners, or by the mayor and council without petition. 
(a)  Construction of improvement. After the expiration of thirty (30) days from the date of the final passage of the ordinance providing for the improvement and making the general assessment, the city shall, as soon as practicable, through its city engineer, or such officers or employees as it may designate[,] proceed to make the improvement, either with its own forces or by contract, as said mayor and council may determine. All improvements made under this act shall be done under direction of the city engineer or his assistants; and the city engineer or his assistants shall prepare and furnish surveys, grades, plans, profiles and other like work, whether the work is to be done by contract or directly by the city. If the work is done under contract, the city shall advertise for bids, but shall not be required to accept the lowest bid where the mayor and council deems the acceptance of a higher bid to be to the city's best interests. On all contracts, the bond required by statute shall be given by the contractor, with surety thereon to be approved by the city mayor and council. The actual work of paving or making other street improvement shall be held in and of itself to constitute notice to abutting property owners, and railroad companies having tracks in the street improved, that such work is being done, and how the cost of such improvement is to be assessed. 
(b)  Book to be kept; contents, custody; effect of entry of assessment. The city shall provide and keep a permanent book to be known as "assessment book for street improvements," and shall provide additional volumes as the same are needed. Each volume shall bear a separate number or letter, and the pages thereof shall be numbered consecutively. The books shall be indexed so as to show each street upon which property assessed abuts, and the heading of each page of said book shall show the name and portion of each street upon which assessments for improvements are made. Said book shall contain appropriate columns for a brief description of each parcel of land assessed, the name of the apparent owner, frontage on the street improved, cost of the improvement per square yard or front foot, and amount of assessment apportioned against each parcel of abutting property; the amount, if any, to be paid by the city; and on said book shall be entered the amount, if any, assessed against any railroad company. No error, omission or mistake in regard to the name of the owner shall invalidate any assessment. 
Said book shall be kept in the office of the city clerk, shall be a public record, and the entry therein of any assessment shall constitute notice to the public of the lien against the land so assessed, and of the lien against any railroad company; said lien to date and rank as hereinafter set forth. 
(c)  Audit of costs; apportionment against abutting properties. When the improvement has been completed, the city engineer, or his assistants, shall audit all bills and the cost of the work, or contract price, figuring the amount to be charged against railroad companies, if any, and the cost chargeable against the city, if any, shall measure the frontages of the several parcels of real estate abutting on the street improved; and the part of the cost of said improvement which under the ordinance providing therefor is to be assessed against railroad companies by said city engineer or his assistants, [shall] be charged against said companies; and the part of the cost to be assessed against abutting property is, by said city engineer or his assistants, to be so apportioned to and charged against each abutting parcel of land and the apparent owner thereof at the time of making such apportionment, in proportion to the frontage on the street or portion of street improved. 
(d)  Entry in assessment book, report as to improvements; action on report; errors, omissions in assessment book. The city engineer, or his assistants, shall enter upon the "assessment book for street improvements" the amounts apportioned against the several parcels of real estate, and against railroad companies, if any, the description of each parcel of abutting real estate against which assessment is made, and the other items called for by the appropriate columns in said book, and shall make his report to a regular meeting of the mayor and council, submitting at the same time said assessment book with the entries therein. The report shall show the total cost of the improvement, the amount to be paid by the city, the amount charged against railroad companies, if any, and the total amount charged against abutting property. 
The mayor and council shall examine said report and said assessment book, and, if the same appear to be correct, shall adopt a resolution approving said report and the entires [entries] and apportionments in said book, and the adoption of said book, and the adoption of said resolution shall constitute the completion of the assessment lien against each parcel of abutting property and against the property of any railroad company. Said resolution may be adopted on one reading and need not be published. The report of the city engineer shall be recorded by the city clerk with said resolution in the book of ordinances and minutes of the mayor and council; but the approval of the individual assessments against abutting property and against railroad companies, as entered in said assessment book, may be by reference in said resolution to the volume and page of the assessment book, so that said individual assessments need not be recorded in the books of ordinances and minutes. When said assessments have been so approved by resolution of the mayor and council, they shall be construed and presumed to have been made according to special benefits accruing to the property assessed. 
Any errors or omissions in the assessment book, whether in the description of property, names, dates, amounts or otherwise, may be corrected at any time, before or after the approval of the city engineer's report, which corrections may be made by resolution of the mayor and council or the mayor and council may, by ordinance or resolution, authorize such corrections to be made by any officer or employee of the city. 
(e)  Lien; creation, rank; payment; lien of previous assessments. In cases of all assessments for improvements made under ordinances hereafter adopted by the mayor and council, the ordinance providing for the improvement and making the general assessment against abutting property and against railroad companies shall create an inchoate lien upon said abutting property and upon the property of said railroad companies located in said city; but said lien shall date, rank and become fixed from and on the date of the passage of the resolution approving the entries in the assessment book as above provided, and in the amount set forth in said assessment book. The city clerk shall certify on each page of said assessment book the date of the passage by the mayor and council of the resolution approving said entries. Said assessment (and each installment thereof, if payable in installments) is hereby declared to be a lien against the lots and parcels of land described in said assessment, and against the property of railroad companies in said city co-equal with the lien of other taxes and prior to all other liens, whether then existing or afterwards created, and shall be enforced by execution as hereafter set forth. The liens of assessments for improvements made under ordinances adopted before the passage of this act, and which date from the passage of the original ordinance providing for the work and making the assessment, whether or not the individual apportionment of assessments has been approved by the mayor and council, shall remain valid and binding. 
(f)  Statement of assessment. Immediately after the passage of the resolution approving the assessments, the city clerk, or other officer or employee of the city, shall mail to each abutting property owner, and to each railroad company, if any, a statement showing the total amount of such assessment, the frontage, the charge per square yard or lineal foot, the date when said assessments, or the installments (if any), are due, the place where payable, and the terms of payment, and also directing how and when the same shall be paid. Failure to mail or receive such statement shall not affect the validity nor the date of maturity of any assessment. 
(g)  Entry of payment, certification of amount unpaid. When any assessment has been paid in full, the city clerk shall make entry on the assessment book for street improvements, showing such payment. Where any assessment is payable in installments, the owner of the property assessed, his grantee, representative, or other person interested therein, shall be entitled to receive from the city clerk a certificate showing the amount of said assessment still unpaid, and said certificate shall be binding upon the city.

Sec. 10-11. - Installment payment of assessments authorized; writing to be executed, interest on installments; default; ordinance, resolution required in certain cases.

Such deferred payments (before the issuance of execution) shall bear interest from the date when by ordinance or resolution the entire assessment was due, until said installments are paid, at the rate of seven (7) percent per annum, said interest payable annually on the entire amounts of installments outstanding, whether or not said installments are then due. Upon default in the payment of any installment, or interest, and said default continuing for thirty (30) days, all of said installments shall become due, and executions shall be issued and levied for the total amount of said installments, with interest. 
In order to have the right to pay an assessment in installments, the person so electing shall execute a writing, on a form to be furnished by the city, obligating himself or itself to pay said installments as above set forth. 
After having signed said election to pay in installments, said installments, or any of them, may be paid before maturity, with accrued interest, by the person against whose property the assessment was made, for his or its representatives or assigns. 
In cases of assessments for street improvements after petition of owners of more than fifty (50) percent of the abutting property, where such improvements consist of sidewalks, curbs or gutters, or improvements of the roadway or street proper, persons whose property is assessed for such improvements may have the right to pay in installments as hereinabove provided only in cases where specially provided by ordinance or resolution.

Sec. 10-12. - Execution for unpaid assessment, installment; procedure, form; docket to be kept; interest upon executions. 
Whenever any assessment against abutting property or any railroad company shall become due, or any installment thereof shall become due and remain unpaid for a period of thirty (30) days, the clerk of the City of Dalton shall issue an execution against the parcel of real estate assessed, or against any real estate of said railroad company in said city, for the entire amount of said assessment, with interest and costs, and said execution shall be levied by the levying officer of said city in the manner now provided by the charter of said city, and the same shall be advertised once a week for four (4) weeks, and sold as now provided in said charter.

Said execution may name as owner of the property levied on either the apparent owner thereof at the date of the resolution approving the assessment, or the apparent owner or anyone claiming an interest in the land at the date of issuing the execution. 
The city clerk shall keep an execution docket on which executions issued for street improvements shall be entered, with the date thereof, time and when delivered, and the proceedings had thereunder.

Sec. 10-13. - Contesting execution; procedure; application of section; effect of election to pay in installments. 
Any person, including any railroad company, against whose property an execution for street improvement assessment has been issued and levied, whether the lien therefor arose before or arises after the passage of this act, shall have the right to file with the levying officer an affidavit of illegality, with bond approved by the levying officer, denying that the whole or any part of said assessment is due, denying special benefit, or setting up any other legal defense, stating the specific grounds of such illegality, and stating the amount, if any, admitted to be due. The amount admitted to be due shall be paid to the levying officer before the affidavit is received and the affidavit and bond received for the balance; and all such affidavits so received shall be returned to the superior court of Whitfield County and there tried, and the issue determined as in other cases of illegality, subject to all penalties provided by law in cases of illegality for delay. The bond provided for in this section shall be conditioned the same as bonds in other illegality proceedings. 
This right to file affidavits of illegality shall apply whether the street improvement for which the execution was issued was made with or without petition of property owners, and whether or not the right to file said illegality be provided for by ordinance of said city. Provided, however, that where the owner or apparent owner of the real estate has in writing elected to pay said assessment in installments, as hereinbefore provided, such election shall be conclusive, and such owner or apparent owner, his or its heirs, representatives, successors, or assigns shall have no right, by affidavit of illegality or otherwise, to contest the validity of the assessment, nor the amount of such assessment set forth in the instrument electing to pay in installments; but where credits are claimed on the original assessment, such affidavit of illegality may be filed to contest the accuracy of the amount set forth in the execution.

Said ordinance or ordinances shall specify what amounts of bonds are to be assessed, for what purpose or purposes, what interest they are to bear, how much principal and interest to be paid annually, and when to be fully paid off.

Sec. 10-17. - Disposition of funds from sale of bonds, collection of assessments, tax levy. 
The funds derived from the sale of any of the street improvement bonds herein provided for shall be used to pay the cost or contract price of making the street improvement for which a particular series of bonds was issued. 
After paying such cost or contract price of the particular improvement, the surplus, if any, shall be placed and kept in one separate and special account, to be known as [the] "special street improvement bond fund," and into said fund shall also be paid all surplus, if any, from the sale of all other similar street improvement bonds. There shall also be paid into said "special street improvement bond fund" the amounts collected on all assessments and installments of assessments, with interest thereon, which were included in the total amounts of assessments for street improvements for which any of said bonds were issued to pay. Such special fund shall be used only to pay the principal and interest of any and all issues of such bonds as the same mature, and any expenses and court costs directly connected with the validation and legal approval of said bonds. 
It is the intention hereof, however, that said bonds and the interest thereon shall be payable as they mature, as direct obligations of said city, whether or not the amount of collections of said assessments be sufficient therefor; and to secure such prompt payment, the annual tax in this act provided, or so much thereof as may be necessary, shall be levied, collected and devoted to that purpose.

Sec. 10-18. - Misuse of "special street improvement bond fund."

When bonds are authorized, issued and sold in substantial compliance with the provisions of this act, and the charter and ordinances of said city, they shall be valid and binding obligations of said city, whether or not they be declared valid through judicial proceedings; but the mayor and council may also direct that said bonds be validated by order of court in the manner now or hereafter provided by the laws of Georgia.

Sec. 10-20. - Minor repairs of paved sidewalks authorized; assessment, collection of cost; contest of execution. 
Where any paved sidewalk in said city becomes, in the opinion of the city engineer, defective and dangerous for want of repair, and the cost of such repair does not exceed at any one time the sum of one hundred dollars ($100.00), the city engineer may proceed at once, without ordinance or resolution of the mayor and council, to have said sidewalk repaired, either with the city's own forces or by contract with an independent contractor. 
The cost or contract price of making such repairs shall be charged against the abutting real estate, and constitute a lien thereon from the date of completing the work. If the amount of the assessment is not paid within thirty (30) days of the completion of the work, the city clerk shall issue an execution against the abutting real estate and the owner thereof, which execution shall be enforced as in cases of other assessments for street improvements. A certificate from the city engineer setting forth the facts and describing the abutting property shall be sufficient warrant for the issuance of said execution. 
Assessments for repairs under this section need not be entered on the assessment book for street improvements, but all papers connected therewith shall be kept by the city clerk in appropriate files. 
Any person whose real estate is assessed for sidewalk repairs under this section shall have the right to contest the necessity of such improvement, or the amount of the assessment, or make other legal defense, by affidavit of illegality, in the manner heretofore provided in this act. 
The lien for repairs to dangerous sidewalks made under this section shall not affect bona fide purchasers or lienholders without notice unless execution has been issued and entered upon the general execution docket of Whitfield County.

All such bonds shall be signed by the chairman of the authority and attested by the secretary and treasurer of the authority and the official seal of the authority shall be affixed thereto and any coupons attached thereto shall bear the facsimile signatures of the chairman and secretary and treasurer of the authority. Any bond may be signed, sealed and attested on behalf of the authority by such persons as at the actual time of the execution of such bonds shall be duly authorized or hold the proper office, although at the date of delivery and payment of such bonds such persons may not have been so authorized or shall not have held such office. 
"I.  Same—Negotiability, exemption from taxation. All revenue bonds issued under the provisions hereof shall be fully negotiable for all purposes and shall have and are hereby declared to have all of the qualifications of negotiable instruments under the laws of the state. Such bonds are declared to be issued for an essential public and governmental purpose and the said bonds and the income thereof shall be exempt from all taxation within the state. 
"J.  Same—Sale, price. The authority may sell such bonds in such manner and for such price as it may determine to be for the best interest of the authority. 
"K.  Same—Proceeds of bonds. The proceeds of such bonds shall be used solely for the payment of the cost of the project or projects, and unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture, additional bonds may in like manner be issued to provide the amount of any deficit, which unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture shall be deemed to be of the same issue and shall be entitled to payment from the same fund without preference or priority of the bonds first issued for the same purpose. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue shall exceed the amount required for the purpose for which such bonds are issued, the surplus shall be paid into such funds as may be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture. 
"L.  Same—Interim receipts and certificates or temporary bonds. Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the authority may, under like restrictions[,] issue interim receipts, interim certificates or temporary bonds, with or without coupons exchangeable for definitive bonds upon the issuance of the latter. 
"M.  Same—Replacement of lost or mutilated bonds. The authority may also provide for the replacement of any bond which shall become mutilated or be destroyed or lost. 
"N.  Same—Conditions precedent to issuance; object of issuance. Such revenue bonds may be issued without any other proceedings or the happening of any other conditions and things which are specified or required herein [sic]. In the discretion of the authority, revenue bonds of a single issue may be issued for the purpose of any particular project. Any resolution, providing for the issuance of revenue bonds upon the provisions hereof[,] shall become effective immediately upon its passage and need not be published or posted, and any such resolution may be passed at any regular or special or adjourned meeting of the authority by a majority of the quorum as herein provided. 
"O.  Same—Credit not pledged and debt not created. Revenue bonds issued by the authority hereunder shall not be deemed to constitute a debt of the City of Dalton, Georgia, nor of any municipality, county, authority, or political subdivision of the State of Georgia or instrumentality of the United States government which may contract with such authority. No contracts entered into by the authority with any such municipality, county, authority or political subdivision of the State of Georgia or instrumentality of the United States government shall create a debt of the respective municipalities, counties, authorities or political subdivisions of the State of Georgia within the meaning of Article VII, Section VII, Paragraph I of the Constitution of the State of Georgia [1983 Ga. Const. art. IX, § V, ¶ I], but any such municipality, county, authority or political subdivision of the State of Georgia may obligate itself to pay the payments required under such contracts from monies received from taxes and from any other source without creating a debt within the meaning of Article VII, Section VII, Paragraph I of the Constitution of the State of Georgia [1983 Ga. Const. art. IX, § V, ¶ I]. 
"P.  Same—Trust indenture as security. In the discretion of the authority, any issue of such revenue bonds may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or outside of the state. Such trust indenture may pledge or assign fees, tolls, revenues and earnings to be received by the authority, including the proceeds derived from the sale from time [to time] of any surplus property of the authority, both real and personal. Either the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or such trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the authority in relation to the acquisition of property, the construction of the project, the maintenance, operation, repair and insurance of the property, and the custody, safeguarding and application of all monies, including the proceeds derived from the sale of property of the authority, both real and personal, and may also provide that any project shall be constructed and paid for under the supervision and approval of consulting engineers or architects employed or designated by the authority, and satisfactory to the original purchasers of the bonds issued therefor and may also require that the security given by contractors and by any depository of the proceeds of the bonds or revenues or other monies be satisfactory to such purchasers, and may also contain provisions concerning the conditions, if any, upon which additional revenue bonds may be issued. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this state to act as such depository and to furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the authority. Such indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee, and may restrict the individual right of action of bondholders as is customary in trust indentures securing bonds and debentures of corporations. In addition to the foregoing, such trust indenture may contain such other provisions as the authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation and repair of the project affected by such indenture. 
"Q.  Same—To whom proceeds of bonds shall be paid. The authority shall, in the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, provide for the payment of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds to any officer or person who or any agency, bank or trust company which shall act as trustee of such funds and shall hold and apply the same to the purposes hereof, subject to such regulations as are herein provided and such regulations as may be provided in such resolution or trust indenture. 
"R.  Same—Sinking fund. The revenues, fees, tolls and earnings derived from any particular project or projects, regardless of whether or not such fees, earnings and revenues were produced by a particular project for which bonds have been issued and any monies derived from the sale of any properties, both real and personal of the authority, unless otherwise pledged and allocated, may be pledged and allocated by the authority to the payment of the principal and interest on revenue bonds of the authority as the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust instrument may provide, and such funds so pledged from whatever source received, which said pledge may include funds received from one or more or all sources, shall be set aside at regular intervals as may be provided in the resolution or trust indenture, into a sinking fund which said sinking fund shall be pledged to and charged with the payments of: 
(1)  The interest upon such revenue bonds as such interest shall fall due, 
(2)  The principal of the bonds as the same shall fall due, 
(3)  The necessary charges of paying agent or agents for paying principal and interest, and 
(4)  Any premium upon bonds retired by call or purchase as hereinabove provided. 
The use and disposition of such sinking fund shall be subject to such regulations as may be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, but, except as may otherwise be provided in such resolution or trust indenture, such sinking fund shall be a fund for the benefit of all revenue bonds without distinction or priority of one over another. Subject to the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture surplus monies in the sinking fund may be applied to the purchase or redemption of bonds and any such bonds so purchased or redeemed shall forthwith be cancelled and shall not again be issued. 
"S.  Same—Remedies of bondholders. Any holder of revenue bonds issued under the provisions hereof or any of the coupons appertaining thereto, and the trustee under the trust indenture, if any, except to the extent the rights herein given may be restricted by resolution passed before the issuance of the bonds or by the trust indenture, may, either at law or in equity, by suit, action, mandamus, or other proceedings, protect and enforce any and all rights under the laws of the State of Georgia or granted hereunder such resolution or trust indenture, and may enforce and compel performance of all duties required herein or by such resolution or trust indenture, to be performed by the authority, or any officer thereof, including the fixing, charging, and collecting of revenues, fees, tolls, and other charges for the use of the facilities and services furnished. 
"T.  Same—Refunding bonds. The authority is hereby authorized to provide by resolution for the issue of revenue bonds of the authority for the purpose of refunding any revenue bonds issued under the provisions hereof and then outstanding, together with accrued interest thereon. The issuance of such revenue refunding bonds, the maturities and all other details thereof, the rights of the holders thereof, and the duties of the authority in respect to the same, shall be governed by the foregoing provisions hereof insofar as the same may be applicable. 
"U.  Same—Venue and jurisdiction. Any action to protect or enforce any rights under the provisions hereof or any suit or action against such authority shall be brought in the superior court of Whitfield County, Georgia, and any action pertaining to validation of any bonds issued under the provisions hereof shall likewise be brought in said court which shall have exclusive, original jurisdiction of such actions. 
"V.  Same—Validation. Bonds of the authority shall be confirmed and validated in accordance with the procedure of the Revenue Bond Law [O.C.G.A. § 36-82-60 et seq.]. The petition for validation shall also make party defendant to such action any municipality, county, authority, subdivision, or instrumentality of the State of Georgia or the United States government or any department or agency of the United States government, if subject to be sued, which has contracted with the authority for the services and facilities of the project for which bonds are to be issued and sought to be validated and such municipality, county, authority, subdivision or instrumentality shall be required to show cause, if any, why such contract or contracts and the terms and conditions thereof should not be inquired into by the court and the validity of the terms thereof be determined and the contract or contracts adjudicated as security for the payment of any such bonds of the authority. The bonds when validated and the judgment of validation shall be final and conclusive with respect to such bonds, against the authority issuing the same, and any municipality, county, authority, subdivision, or instrumentality of the United States government, if a party to the validation proceedings, contracting with the said The City of Dalton Building Authority. 
"W.  Same—Interest of bondholders protected. While any of the bonds issued by the authority remain outstanding, the powers, duties or existence of said authority or of its officers, employees or agents shall not be diminished or impaired in any manner that will affect adversely the interest and rights of the holders of such bonds, and no other entity, department, agency or authority will be created which will compete with the authority to such an extent as to affect adversely the interest and rights of the holders of such bonds, nor will the state itself so compete with the authority. The provisions hereof shall be for the benefit of the authority and the holders of any such bonds, and upon the issuance of bonds under the provisions hereof, shall constitute a contract with the holders of such bonds. 
"X.  Monies received considered trust funds. All monies received pursuant to the authority hereof, whether as proceeds from the sale of revenue bonds, as grants or other contributions, or as revenues, income, fees, and earnings shall be deemed to be trust funds to be held and applied solely as provided for herein. 
"Y.  Exemption from taxation. It is hereby declared that the authority will be performing an essential governmental function in the exercise of the power conferred upon it hereunder and that the authority shall be required to pay no taxes or assessments upon any of the property acquired by it or under its jurisdiction, control, possession or supervision or upon its activities in the operation and maintenance of the buildings erected or acquired by it or any fees, rentals or other charges for the use of such buildings or other income received by the authority. 
"Z.  Immunity from tort actions. The authority shall have the same immunity and exemption from liability for torts and negligence as the State of Georgia has and the officers, agents and employees of the authority when in performance of the work of the authority shall have the same immunity and exemption from liability for torts and negligence as the officers, agents and employees of the State of Georgia. The authority may be sued in the same manner as private corporations may be sued on any contractual obligation of the authority. 
"AA.  Property subject to levy and sale. The property of the authority shall not be subject to levy and sale under legal process except such property, revenue, income or funds as may be pledged, assigned, mortgaged or conveyed to secure an obligation of the authority, and any such property, revenue, funds or income may be sold under legal process or under any power granted by the authority to enforce payment of the obligation. 
"BB.  Construction. This amendment and all provisions, rights, powers and authority granted hereunder shall be effective, notwithstanding any other provision of the Constitution to the contrary, and this amendment and any law enacted with reference to the authority shall be liberally construed for the accomplishment of its purposes. 
"CC.  Effective date. This amendment shall be effective immediately upon proclamation of its ratification by the governor. 
"DD.  General Assembly. This amendment is self enacting and does not require any enabling legislation for it to become effective. However, the General Assembly may, by law, further define and prescribe the powers and duties of the authority and the exercise thereof and may enlarge and restrict the same and may, likewise, further regulate the management and conduct of the authority not inconsistent with the provisions of this amendment. The authority shall be an instrumentality of the State of Georgia, and the scope of its operation shall be limited to the territory embraced within the corporate limits of the City of Dalton, Georgia, as the same now or may hereafter exist and with the limits of the area of Whitfield County, Georgia.

Annotation— Where the minutes show the adoption of an ordinance, and the mayor's vote was required for its legal adoption, it is presumed that the mayor, if present, voted for the ordinance. The testimony of the city clerk that he did not publish an ordinance is not conclusive evidence that the ordinance was not published. Hamilton v. North Georgia Electric Membership Corp., 201 Ga. 689, 40 S.E.2d 750 (1946). 
Where an ordinance is in itself complete and properly passed, the fact that it recites in its title that it was enacted to amend a former ordinance which was void does not invalidate it. McCallum v. Bryant, 211 Ga. 98, 84 S.E.2d 39 (1954).

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 2-121. - Liability protection. 
(a)  This section shall be known as the municipal liability protection ordinance and may be referred to as such in any document or pleading. 
(b)  The mayor and council find as follows: 
(1)  The city's elected and appointed officers, supervisors, administrators and employees have increasingly been the target of liability lawsuits for actions arising out of the performance of their duties or in any way connected therewith; 
(2)  The general assembly has empowered municipalities to purchase liability insurance or contracts of indemnity insuring or indemnifying the members of governing bodies and supervisors, administrators, employees or other elected or appointed officers of municipalities against personal liability for damages arising out of the performance of their duties or in any way connected therewith, whether based upon negligence, violation of contract rights or violation of civil, constitutional, common law or other statutory rights, whether state, federal or local; 
(3)  The city has purchased liability insurance covering certain acts of the mayor and council, supervisors, administrators, employees and other elected or appointed public officers on a continuous basis since 1982; 
(4)  Liability insurance is not always available to cover all necessary areas of potential liability of the mayor and council, supervisors, administrators, employees and other elected or appointed public officers of the city; 
(5)  The city needs to retain the services of capable and experienced supervisors, administrators, employees and other public officers as well as to encourage capable and experienced members of the general public to seek and hold elective office of the city, and the prospect of personal liability unmet by available insurance is a deterring factor to the city's meeting such goal; 
(6)  The state general assembly has provided that a municipality may adopt a policy establishing the terms and conditions under which it will pay part or all of any claim or civil judgment rendered against the mayor or any alderman, supervisor, administrator, employee or other elected or appointed official of the city whom it is authorized to defend pursuant to a written public policy; 
(7)  It is in the best interest of the city and the good order and administration of the government of the city and its people that the city establish, in addition to any liability insurance or contract of indemnity and secondary thereto, only a policy under which the city will undertake to defend all or specified civil, criminal or quasicriminal actions brought or maintained against the mayor and any alderman or against any supervisors, administrators, employees or other elected or appointed city officers arising out of the performance of their duties or in any way connected therewith, based upon negligence, violation of contract rights or violation of civil, constitutional, common law or statutory rights and to pay part or all of any claim or civil judgment rendered against any person whose defense the city so undertakes; and 
(8)  These should be limitations on such duty to provide a legal defense and obligation to pay part or all of any claim or civil judgment rendered against the mayor or any alderman, supervisor, administrator, employee or other elected or appointed officer of the city such that the city is not defending or paying claims or judgments with respect to criminal offenses involving theft, embezzlement or other like crimes with respect to the property or money of or in which the city has an interest. 
(c)  In addition to any contract to defend provided under any liability insurance or contract of indemnity insuring or indemnifying the mayor or aldermen, supervisors, administrators, employees or other elected or appointed officers of the city against personal liability for damages arising out of the performance of their duties or in any way connected therewith and secondary thereto only, it shall be the city's policy to provide as a part of the compensation in terms of employment of the mayor and aldermen, all supervisors, administrators, employees and other elected or appointed officers of the city a defense for all civil, criminal or quasicriminal actions brought or maintained against such mayor, aldermen, supervisors, administrators, employees and other elected or appointed officials, arising out of the performance of their duties or in any way connected therewith, whether based upon negligence, violation of contract rights or violation of civil, constitutional, common law or statutory rights. However, the city shall not be authorized to furnish a defense to any person charged with a criminal offense involving theft, embezzlement or other like crime with respect to the property or money of or in which the city has an interest. 
(1)  The city may expend public funds for such purposes, including, but not limited to attorney's fees, court costs, deposition costs, witness fees and compensation and all other like costs, expenses and fees. 
(2)  The city shall designate in its sole discretion appropriate legal counsel to fulfill its policy of providing legal defense under subsection (c)(1) of this section. As a condition of receipt of such legal defense, the mayor, aldermen, supervisors, administrators, employees and other elected or appointed officials of the city shall have the duty to cooperate with such legal counsel designated by the city in the defense of the claim or suit. 
(d)  In addition to any liability insurance or contract of indemnity covering the mayor, aldermen, supervisors, administrators, employees or other elected or appointed officials of the city, and secondary thereto only, the city shall pay part or all of any claim or civil judgment rendered against any person as provided in this section whose defense the city is authorized to undertake under subsection (c) of this section. As a condition to such payment of any part or all of any claim or civil judgment, such person shall be obligated to cooperate with the attorneys appointed or designated by the city to defend such person in the action. Failure of such employee to cooperate in the defense of the action shall void any obligation of the city to pay part or all of any claim or civil judgment rendered against such person. 
(e)  This section is intended to set forth a written policy for the city as authorized and provided in O.C.G.A. §§ 45-9-21 and 45-9-22. Nothing in this section shall be construed as waiving any immunity or privilege of any kind enjoyed by the city or other public body, department, board, commission or agency of the city or by the mayor and any alderman or by any supervisor, administrator, employee or other elected or appointed officer of the city or any public body, board, department, agency or political subdivision of the city.

The open records officer shall serve at the pleasure of the mayor and council. 
(Ord. No. 12-06, § 2, 8-7-2012) 
Sec. 2-237. - Duties. 
It shall be the duty of the open records officer and his or her duly designated assistant open records officer(s) to accept written requests to inspect and copy public records, pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 50-18-70, et seq., and to produce to the requester all records responsive to a request within a reasonable amount of time not to exceed three business days of receipt of a request, unless the time for response is extended in accordance with law. No request shall be deemed filed until served upon the open records officer, either by hand delivery or statutory overnight delivery to the open records officer at City Hall, 300 W. Waugh Street, Dalton, Georgia, 30720; by certified United States mail, return receipt requested to the open records officer at P.O. Box 1205, Dalton, Georgia, 30722; by email to openrecords@cityofdalton-ga.gov; or by facsimile transmission to open records officer at 706-529-2491. Requests, whether oral or in writing, served upon any other officer or employee of the city shall not be deemed filed, until the requester has filed his or her request, in writing, with the open records officer. In the absence or unavailability of the open records officer, an assistant open records officer shall perform the duties of the open records officer. The absence or unavailability of a designated open records officer shall not delay the city's response to a properly served request. 
(Ord. No. 12-06, § 2, 8-7-2012) 
Sec. 2-238. - Request response. 
Upon receipt of a request, it shall be the duty of the open records officer to promptly ascertain the availability of all public records responsive to the request and to produce to the requester those records that can be located and produced within a reasonable time, not to exceed three business days of receipt of a request. For purposes of computing the time within which a response must be made, the open records officer shall not count the business day on which a request is received, nor any intervening Saturday, Sunday, or designated holiday on which city offices are closed for general business. Upon intake of a request, the open records officer shall stamp the request with the date and time of receipt, and initial the request. In any instance where records are unavailable within three business days of the request, it shall be the duty of the open records officer to provide the requester with a written description of such records and a timeline for when the records will be available for inspection or copying and to provide the responsive records to the requester as soon thereafter as practicable. Such response shall also contain a good faith estimate of the cost to the requester for the search, retrieval, redaction, and production and copying of records. The open records officer shall confer with every officer or department head of the city, as necessary, to ascertain the existence of public records responsive to a request (including electronically-stored information), and it shall be the duty of every city officer and department head to confer with and provide records, or true and correct copies of the originals thereof, to the open records officer promptly, time being of the essence. Upon receipt of a public record responsive to a request, the open records officer shall determine, in consultation with the city attorney, if the record is exempt from disclosure by order of a court of this state or by law; if the record is exempt from disclosure, the written response by the open records officer shall set forth the specific legal authority under which withholding of inspection of the record is claimed. The open records officer shall maintain a log or other documentation of his or her due diligence to comply with a proper request. 
(Ord. No. 12-06, § 2, 8-7-2012) 
Sec. 2-239. - Fees. 
The open records officer shall further have the duty to collect from a requester a reasonable charge for the search, retrieval, redaction, and production/copying of records, utilizing the most economical means available to identify and produce nonexcluded records. The charge for the search, retrieval, or redaction of records shall not exceed the prorated hourly salary of the lowest paid full-time employee who, in the reasonable discretion of the open records officer, has the necessary skill and training to perform the request; provided, however, no charge shall be made for the first quarter hour. In addition thereto, where certified copies of specific records are sought, the fees for certified copies prescribed by law shall apply; otherwise, a fee for the copying of records shall not exceed ten cents per page for letter or legal size documents or, in the case of other documents and electronic records, the actual cost of reproducing the document or media on which the records or media are produced. It shall be the right of the requester, at the time of inspection, to make photographic copies or other electronic reproductions of records, at his or her own expense, using suitable portable devices brought to the place of inspection. Whenever any person has requested to inspect and copy public records and received a written response estimating the cost of the search, retrieval, redaction, and production/copying of the records responsive to the request, and the city has actually incurred such costs but the requester fails to inspect or accept copies of the records, the open records officer shall be authorized to collect such charges in any manner authorized by law. In any instance in which the open records officer has estimated costs in excess of $25.00 for responding to a request, the open records officer may defer the search, retrieval, redaction, and production/copying of the records until the requester has stated, in writing, his or her willingness to pay an amount equal to the estimate of costs. In any instance in which the estimated costs exceed $500.00, the open records officer shall insist, in writing, upon prepayment of the estimated costs prior to beginning search, retrieval, redaction, production or copying of the records. In any instance in which a requester has outstanding costs owing to the city for a previous records request, the open records officer shall insist upon prepayment of the outstanding costs and estimated costs prior to beginning search and retrieval. 
(Ord. No. 12-06, § 2, 8-7-2012)

The open records officer shall make duplicate set(s) of records provided in response to the request available to all parties or their counsel for the cost of copies only, unless a party or its counsel elects not to receive the records and pay the copying charge. If the city is a party to the action or proceeding, a set of responses shall be provided to counsel for the city at no charge.

(Code 1983, § 3.5-22) 
Cross reference— Definitions generally, § 1-2. 
Sec. 18-67. - Purpose. 
(a)  It is the finding of the mayor and council that it is in the best interest of the health, safety and welfare of the public to regulate the use of the Dalton Municipal Airport by ultralight vehicles. A portion of this regulation is to ensure the compatible use of the Dalton Municipal Airport by ultralight vehicles with conventional powered aircraft. 
(b)  Ultralight vehicles are a recent phenomenon in terms of use of airport facilities and pose special considerations in terms of air, passenger and ground operations safety in their use of the airport. 
(c)  Airport operators may make the determination that ultralight vehicle operations are unsafe and prohibit conduct of ultralight vehicle operations on the airport at any time, whether under emergency conditions or otherwise. 
(d)  Airport operators are obliged to ensure that users of federally assisted airports contribute a fair share toward their operation, and thus a user fee may be imposed on ultralight vehicle operators. 
(Code 1983, § 3.5-21) 
Sec. 18-68. - Operation. 
(a)  The mayor and council find that ultralight vehicles pose special considerations in terms of air and passenger safety, ground safety and property protection in their use at the airport. The Federal Aviation Administration requires a federally assisted airport to accommodate ultralight vehicles if ultralight operations can be safely accomplished at a designated ultralight operations area on the airport. Since the airport is a federally assisted airport and it is the policy of the city to ensure continued development of the airport into a regional facility for private and commercial air traffic, the operational conditions and restrictions in this section shall govern access and use of the airport by ultralight vehicles. 
(b)  Ultralight vehicles shall be restricted to the ultralight pattern for all takeoffs and landings. The ultralight pattern and operating area shall be designated by the airport manager and shall be posted in at least three conspicuous locations throughout the facility of the airport. The ultralight operating area on the runway of the airport shall be a minimum area of 300 by 30 feet as per exhibit A, attached to the ordinance from which this section derives and made a part of this article by reference. 
(c)  Ultralight vehicle operation shall be restricted to those operating times as designated by the airport manager who shall, upon request of any person expressing an interest in ultralight vehicle use of the airport, publish a biweekly schedule of operating times for ultralight vehicles on the airport. Such notice shall be posted at three conspicuous locations throughout the airport. 
(d)  It shall be a violation of the rules and regulations in article II of this chapter and this article for any ultralight vehicle to operate on the airport or be in the traffic pattern of the airport outside the times permitted by the airport manager. Any person who shall violate this subsection shall be subject to citation to the municipal court and, upon conviction for such violation, shall be subject to a fine not to exceed $500.00 and/or 30 days in confinement. 
(e)  The operator of an ultralight vehicle desiring to use the airport shall be required to provide the airport manager, prior to use of the airport, a certificate of public liability insurance covering all events in an amount of not less than $1,000,000.00 combined single limit. Any person operating an ultralight vehicle at the airport without filing such certificate of insurance shall be in violation of this article and shall be subject to citation to the municipal court and, upon conviction for such violation, shall be subject to a fine not to exceed $500.00 and/or 30 days in confinement. 
(f)  Unless otherwise modified by written directive as set forth in this section by the airport manager, the ultralight pattern shall be the pattern shown on exhibit A, to the ordinance from which this section derives. 
(Code 1983, § 3.5-62) 
Editor's note— A copy of exhibit A as adopted herein by reference is on file in the office of the city clerk. 
Sec. 18-69. - Rules and regulations. 
All operations including but not limited to ground and air operations at the airport, taxiing, takeoffs, landings, fueling, storage and flight within the traffic pattern or airspace within two radial miles from the center of the runway of the airport to an altitude of 1,000 feet mean sea level (msl) by ultralight vehicles shall be subject to the following: 
(1)  The ultralight operating area on the runway of the airport shall be marked by black or white lines on the runway or by flexible flags. 
(2)  Ultralight vehicles shall not taxi on the taxi lanes or aprons of the airport or upon airport runways except for making a direct approach to the runway for purposes of takeoff or for purposes of clearing the runway after landing in accordance with sound aviation practice. 
(3)  Ultra light vehicles shall not taxi, take off or land at the airport except during those operating times designated by the airport manager, who shall publish a schedule of approved operating times for ultralight vehicles on the airport if there shall be any request for ultralight vehicle use. The direction of the ultralight pattern for takeoffs and landings on the airport shall be designated by the airport manager as necessary to be compatible with other airport traffic. The airport manager is authorized to prohibit ultralight vehicle operations at the airport for safety purposes in his discretion, and the duty to issue an advisory on operational times for ultralight vehicles does not mean that ultralight vehicles shall be entitled to use the airport at all times. In making any decision as to the prohibition of ultralight vehicle operations at the airport for safety purposes, the airport manager shall consider the following: frequency of use of the airport by ultralight vehicles simultaneously with conventional powered aircraft operations from a single runway; the adequacy of the ultralight vehicle pattern; and related general air and ground safety matters affecting vehicle, aircraft, ground, personnel, passenger, pilot and general public safety. 
(4)  Ultralight vehicles upon takeoff shall proceed outbound to an area of not less than two radial miles from the center of the runway of the airport to hover, cruise or perform in-flight maneuvers. Therefore, no ultralight vehicle shall hover, cruise or perform in-flight maneuvers after takeoff within the two-radial-mile area from the center of the runway except for approach to the airport for landing purposes. 
(5)  Proof of insurance shall be filed with the airport manager who shall keep the proof on file and who may request verification of such insurance from time to time.

Sec. 50-209. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices. 
(a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the ordinance and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion and sedimentation control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of 50-208(b) and (c) of this article. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this ordinance and the NPDES general permit. 
(b)  Minimum requirements/BMP's. 
(1)  Best management practices as set forth in section 50-208(b) and (c) of this article shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f). As used in this subsection, the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic-design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
(2)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act, for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not a part of a larger common plan of development of sale unless the planned disturbance of such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
(3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Act," for each day on which such failure occurs. 
(4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
(5)  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsections 50-208(c)(15), (16) and (17) of this article in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
(6)  Construction site operators must control waste at the construction site, such as discarded building materials, concrete washout, chemicals, litter, and sanitary waste. 
(c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to this chapter for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
(1)  Stripping of vegetation, regarding and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
(2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
(3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practical erosion potential; 
(4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
(5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
(6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
(7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
(8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
(9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
(10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
(11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
(12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
(13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
(14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in section 50-208(b)(2) of this article; 
(15)  Except as provided in paragraph (16) and (17) of this subsection, there is established a 25 foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, or where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or where bulkheads and sea walls are installed to prevent shoreline erosion on Lake Oconee and Lake Sinclair; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream: That under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow, Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to Georgia Water Quality Act shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project, plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
(16)  There is established a 50 foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to the Georgia Water Quality Act, except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25 foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project, plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines. 
(17)  There is established a 25 foot buffer along coastal marshlands, as measured horizontally from the coastal marshland-upland interface, as determined in accordance with Chapter 5 of Title 12 of this title, the "Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1970." And the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to Code Section 12-2-8, where an alteration within the buffer area has been authorized pursuant to Code Section 12-5-286, for maintenance of any currently serviceable structure, landscaping, or hardscaping, including bridges, roads, parking lots, golf courses, golf cart paths, retaining walls, bulkheads, and patios; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, where a drainage structure or roadway drainage structure is constructed or maintained; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, on the landward side of any currently serviceable shoreline stabilization structure, or for the maintenance of any manmade storm-water detention basin, golf course pond, or impoundment that is located entirely within the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. For the purposes of this paragraph maintenance shall be defined as actions necessary or appropriate for retaining or restoring a currently serviceable improvement to the specified operable condition to achieve its maximum useful life. Maintenance includes emergency reconstruction of recently damaged parts of a currently serviceable structure so long as it occurs within a reasonable period of time after damage occurs. Maintenance does not include any modification that changes the character, scope or size of the original design and serviceable shall be defined as usable in its current state or with minor maintenance but not so degraded as to essentially require reconstruction. 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to crossings for utility lines that cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer, provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
c.  The buffer shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity conducted pursuant to and in compliance with a valid and effective land-disturbing permit issued subsequent to April 22, 2014, and prior to December 31, 2015; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented or any lot for which the preliminary plat has been approved prior to December 31, 2015 if roadways, bridges, or water and sewer lines have been extended to such lot prior to the effective date of this Act and if the requirement to maintain a 25 foot buffer would consume at least 18 percent of the high ground of the platted lot otherwise available for development; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
d.  Activities where the area within the buffer is not more than 500 square feet or that have a "minor buffer impact" as defined in 391-3-7-.01(r), provided that the total area of buffer impacts is less than 5,000 square feet are deemed to have an approved buffer variance by rule.

(d)  Nothing contained in this chapter shall prevent a local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in this section 50-208. 
(e)  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
(Ord. No. 16-15, § 1, 12-19-2016) 
Sec. 50-210. - Application; permit process. 
(a)  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The engineer shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. He shall consult the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
(b)  Application requirements. 
(1)  No person shall conduct any land- disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the city without first obtaining a permit from the engineer to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
(2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the Engineer and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in section 50-209(c) of this article. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of section 50-208(b) and (c) of this article will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by four copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. 
All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-10. 
(3)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(5)(a), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land-disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a), half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the Division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. Secondary permittees shall provide to the engineer a copy of any such notice of intent submitted to the State of Georgia when applying for a building permit. 
(4)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the engineer shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the engineer. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by section 50-209(15), (16) and (17), has been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per subsection 50-210(b)(5)(ii) have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
(5)  a.  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this article section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing of the application under consideration, the engineer may deny the permit application. 
b.  The engineer may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this article or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the city may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the city with respect to alleged permit violations. 
(c)  Plan requirements. 
(1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in subsections 50-208(b) and (c) of this article or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" is hereby incorporated by reference into this article. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and storm water management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. §12-7-20. 
(2)  Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
(d)  Permits.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY[9] 

Footnotes: 
--- (9) --- 
Editor's note— Ord. No. 06-19, § 1, adopted Aug. 7, 2006, created three divisions containing general information regarding floodplain management. At the editor's discretion and with the consent of the city, these provisions have been reorganized to read as herein set out to standardize similar material and better reflect the organizational style of the Code. 

Sec. 50-240. - Findings. 
It is hereby determined by the mayor and council that: 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  Flood hazard areas can serve important stormwater management, water quality, stream bank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation and ecological purposes when permanently protected as undisturbed or minimally disturbed areas. 
(c)  Effective floodplain management and flood hazard protection activities can: 
1.  Protect human life and health; 
2.  Minimize damage to private property; 
3.  Minimize damage to public facilities and infrastructure such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; and 
4.  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public. 
(d)  The regulation of flood hazard areas and the prevention of flood damage are in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety, as well as to private and public property. 
(Ord. No. 06-19, § 1, 8-7-2006) 
Sec. 50-241. - Purpose and intent. 
The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in flood hazard areas, as well as to protect the beneficial uses of floodplain areas for water quality protection, stream bank and stream corridor protection, wetlands preservation and ecological and environmental protection by provisions designed to: 
(a)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(b)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to flooding or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
(c)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
(d)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; 
(e)  Limit the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; and, 
(f)  Protect the stormwater management, water quality, stream bank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation and ecological functions of natural floodplain areas. 
(Ord. No. 06-19, § 1, 8-7-2006)

Site means the parcel of land being developed, or the portion thereof on which the development project is located. 
Start of construction means the date the permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (NOTE: accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance requirements.) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
Subdivision means the division of a tract or parcel of land resulting in one or more new lots or building sites for the purpose, whether immediately or in the future, of sale, other transfer of ownership or land development, and includes divisions of land resulting from or made in connection with the layout or development of a new street or roadway or a change in an existing street or roadway.

Substantial improvement means any combination of repairs, reconstruction, alteration, or improvements to a building, taking place during a ten-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the improvement. The market value of the building means (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures which have incurred "repetitive loss" or "substantial damage" regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include those improvements of a building required to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions, which have been preidentified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project. 
Substantially improved existing manufactured home park or subdivision is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this article which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article. 
Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certificates, or other evidence of compliance required in this ordinance is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

Sec. 50-282. - General standards. 
(a)  No development shall be allowed within the floodplain that could result in any of the following: 
(1)  Raising the base flood elevation equal to or more than 0.01 foot; 
(2)  Reducing the base flood-storage capacity; 
(3)  Changing the flow characteristics as to the depth and velocity of the waters of the base flood as they pass both the upstream and the downstream boundaries of the development area; or, 
(4)  Creating hazardous or erosion-producing velocities, or resulting in excessive sedimentation. 
(b)  Any development within the floodplain allowed under (1) above shall also meet the following conditions: 
(1)  Compensation for storage capacity shall occur between the average groundwater table elevation and the base flood elevation for the base flood, and between the average groundwater table elevation, and lie either within the boundaries of ownership of the property being developed and shall be within the immediate vicinity of the location of the encroachment. Acceptable means of providing required compensation include lowering of natural ground elevations within the floodplain, or lowering of adjoining land areas to create additional floodplain storage. In no case shall any required compensation be provided via bottom storage or by excavating below the elevation of the top of the natural (predevelopment) stream channel unless such excavation results from the widening or relocation of the stream channel; 
(2)  Cut areas shall be stabilized and graded to a slope of no less than two percent; 
(3)  Effective transitions shall be provided such that flow velocities occurring on both upstream and downstream properties are not increased or decreased;

Sec. 50-283. - Engineering study requirements for floodplain encroachments. 
An engineering study is required, as appropriate to the proposed development activities on the site, whenever a development proposes to disturb any land within the floodplain, except for a residential single-lot development on streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodways for which the provisions of section 50-292 apply. This study shall be prepared by a currently registered professional engineer in the state and made a part of the application for a permit. This information shall be submitted to and approved by the building inspector prior to the approval of any permit which would authorize the disturbance of land located within the floodplain. Such study shall include: 
(a)  Description of the extent to which any watercourse or floodplain will be altered or relocated as a result of the proposed development; 
(b)  Step-backwater analysis, using a FEMA-approved methodology approved by the building inspector. Cross-sections (which may be supplemented by the applicant) and flow information will be obtained whenever available. Computations will be shown duplicating FIS results and will then be rerun with the proposed modifications to determine the new base flood profiles. 
(c)  Floodplain storage calculations based on cross-sections (at least one every 100 feet) showing existing and proposed floodplain conditions to show that base flood floodplain storage capacity would not be diminished by the development;

Located within areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, floodways must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore the following provisions shall apply: 
(a)  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway, except for activities specifically allowed in (2) below. 
(b)  Encroachments for bridges, culverts, roadways and utilities within the regulatory floodway may be permitted provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase to the preproject base flood elevations, floodway elevations, or floodway widths during the base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof; and, 
(c)  If the applicant proposes to revise the floodway boundaries, no permit authorizing the encroachment into or an alteration of the floodway shall be issued by the building inspector until an affirmative conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) is issued by FEMA and no-rise certification is approved by the building inspector.

The following variance and appeals procedures shall apply to an applicant who has been denied a permit for a development activity, or to an owner or developer who has not applied for a permit because it is clear that the proposed development activity would be inconsistent with the provisions of this ordinance. A request for a variance may be submitted by an applicant who has been denied a permit by the building inspector or by an owner or developer who has not previously applied for a permit for the reasons stated herein above. 
(a)  Requests for variances from the requirements of this ordinance shall be submitted to the building inspector. All such requests shall be heard and decided in accordance with procedures to be published in writing by the building inspector. At a minimum, such procedures shall include notice to all affected parties and the opportunity to be heard. 
(b)  Any person adversely affected by any decision of the building inspector shall have the right to appeal such decision to the board of zoning appeals as established by the city in accordance with its procedures. 
(c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the board of zoning appeals may appeal such decision to the Superior Court of Whitfield County, Georgia, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1. 
(d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure, and the variance issued shall be the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this section are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
(f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(g)  In reviewing such requests, the building inspector and board of zoning appeals shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article. 
(h)  Conditions for variances: 
1.  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
(i)  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
(ii)  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and, 
(iii)  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, or the creation of a nuisance. 
2.  The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore, any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of a historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
3.  Any person to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
4.  The building inspector shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
(i)  Any person requesting a variance shall, from the time of the request until the time the request is acted upon, submit such information and documentation as the building inspector and the board of zoning appeals shall deem necessary to the consideration of the request. 
(j)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the building inspector and the board of zoning appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as they deem necessary or appropriate, consistent with the purposes of this article.

(b)  Failure to provide ordinary maintenance or repair. Owners of historic buildings or properties within historic districts shall not allow the buildings to deteriorate by failing to provide ordinary maintenance or repair. The historic preservation commission shall be charged with the following responsibilities regarding deterioration by neglect: 
(1)  The historic preservation commission shall monitor the condition of historic properties and existing buildings in historic districts to determine if they are being allowed to deteriorate by neglect. Such conditions as broken windows, doors and openings which allow the elements and vermin to enter; the deterioration of exterior architectural features; or the deterioration of a building's structural system shall constitute failure to provide ordinary maintenance or repair. 
(2)  If the historic preservation commission determines a failure to provide ordinary maintenance or repair, the historic preservation commission will notify the building inspector. The building inspector or his designee shall make an investigation or inspection of the specific dwelling, building, structure, or property identified by the historic preservation commission. The building inspector shall give written notice to the owner of the property and set forth the steps needed to be taken to remedy the situation and the time in which the repairs or maintenance must be completed.

The building inspector shall have the authority to extend the time for repair or maintenance if the extension is necessary due to circumstances beyond the control of the owner. 
(3)  The owner shall make the required repairs or maintenance within the time specified by the building inspector. The building inspector or his designee is authorized to cite an owner who fails to make the required repairs or maintenance within the time specified to the municipal court for violation of this section. Any person who is found to have violated the provisions of this section shall be subject to a civil fine of not less than $200.00, and not more than $1,000.00 for each violation so found. In addition, the municipal court is authorized to require the owner to make the required repairs or maintenance within a time certain. Each day after the time certain that the required repairs or maintenance are not made shall be deemed a separate violation of this section. 
(c)  City's right to repair; time. Notwithstanding citation of the owner for violation of this section, if the property owner does not timely make the required repairs or maintenance, then the property owner will be deemed to have consented to entry onto the property by the city or its designee in order to make the required repairs or maintenance, and the property owner shall reimburse the city on demand for the cost of such repairs or maintenance. The city's right to entry onto the property shall not commence until the property owner has been found in violation of this section by the municipal court and such judgment is final and not appealable. 
(d)  Service. 
(1)  All notices and orders issued pursuant to this section shall be in writing and served upon the owner of property affected or his agent, and, if applicable, persons in possession or occupancy of affected premises. Where such notices and orders cannot be personally served, service shall be made by certified mail, return receipt requested, at the party's last known address as shown on official government records. For parties whose mailing address is unknown, a copy of all notices and orders shall be conspicuously posted on the subject building, structure, or property at least 30 days prior to the date of the issuance of a citation or the taking of any action by the historic preservation commission. 
(2)  A copy of any citation issued pursuant to this section shall be served in one of the following ways: 
a.  Personal service upon each owner and interested party if such parties are residents of the county. Service shall be perfected at least ten days prior to the date of hearing. 
b.  Parties residing in the state outside of the county shall be served pursuant to statutory overnight delivery as that term is defined by the laws of Georgia, mailed at least 14 days prior to the date of hearing. 
c.  Nonresidents of the state, whose mailing address is known, shall be served by certified mail or statutory overnight delivery, return receipt requested, mailed at least 14 days prior to the date of the hearing. For nonresidents whose mailing address is unknown, a notice of the date, time and place of the hearing shall be published in The Daily Citizen News statutory as a legal advertisement once a week for two consecutive weeks prior to the hearing. 
d.  In the event a party is a minor, estate, an incompetent person, or person laboring under disabilities, the guardian or personal representative of such person shall be served. If such person has no guardian or personal representative, service shall be perfected upon the probate judge of the county, who shall appoint a guardian ad litem for such person. 
(e)  Affirmation of existing buildings and zoning codes. Nothing in this article shall be construed as to exempt property owners from complying with existing city or county building and zoning codes nor to prevent any property owner from making any use of his property not prohibited by other statutes, ordinances or regulations.

Sec. 74-331. - Findings and purpose. 
It is the responsibility of the mayor and council to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the city. The mayor and council find that persons under the age of 18 are particularly susceptible by their lack of maturity and experience to participate in unlawful activity and to be victims of older perpetrators of crime. The mayor and council are concerned about criminal activity engaged in by minors and the victimization of minors, especially those crimes and events that occur during late night hours and/or times in which minors should be at home. Studies have shown that curfews are effective to reduce the number of violent and property crimes committed by minors. The Impact of Juvenile Curfew Laws, Patrick Kline, University of California at Berkeley, June 2010; and that comprehensive, community-based juvenile curfew programs help reduce juvenile victimization, Curfew: An Answer to Juvenile Delinquency and Victimization, Juvenile Justice Bulletin, US Department of Justice, April 1996. The mayor and council have determined a curfew for those under the age of 18 will be in the best interest of the public health, safety, and general welfare and will help to attain the foregoing objectives and to diminish the undesirable impact of such conduct on the citizens of the city. Accordingly, the mayor and council find and declare that the purpose of this division is to reduce the number of crimes committed by and against minors during late night hours, and to safeguard the welfare of the citizens of the city.

--- (2) --- 
Editor's note— Ord. No. 09-02, § 1, adopted Feb. 16, 2009, deleted the former Art. II, §§ 98-41—98-44, and enacted a new Art. II as set out herein. The former Art. II pertained to street numbers and derived from Code 1983, §§ 22-40—22-43. 

Sec. 98-41. - Purpose. 
The purpose of this article is to establish a reliable and consistent system of assigning unique addresses to structures and properties within the city. Such system is necessary to ensure the continued public health, safety, and welfare in the following respects: 
(a)  It will improve response time by law enforcement, fire, ambulance, and other emergency services; 
(b)  It will provide a basis for the development of sub-systems that can automatically and quickly generate specific, reliable directions for drivers from any starting location to any destination within the city; 
(c)  It will prevent and resolve duplication of addresses and route names, confusing or misleading addresses, and multiple addresses for a single location. 
(d)  It will improve the delivery of public services, such as building inspections, road and infrastructure repair and maintenance, soil evaluations, utility installation and service, health inspections, property tax administration, property mapping, school busing, and other public services; 
(e)  It will provide for coordination among the mapping and geographic information systems (GIS) in use by various public utilities, parcel delivery, and governmental and quasi-governmental entities operating in the county; 
(f)  It will provide a clear and rational procedure for assigning new addresses and road names within the city as the need shall arise. 
(Ord. No. 09-02, § 1, 2-16-2009) 
Sec. 98-42. - Enforcement authority. 
All addressing functions in the city shall be the responsibility of the chief of the fire department. The fire chief may designate one or more persons to carry out the responsibilities set forth in this article. The fire chief's duties shall include, but shall not be limited to, assigning addresses to new plats, assigning addresses for new residential and commercial construction, identifying and correcting addressing anomalies, giving initial approval or disapproval to new or proposed street names, and making recommendation to the mayor and council for naming new streets or renaming existing streets. All applicants applying to name a new street, to rename an existing street, or to receive a residential or commercial address shall comply with this article. 
(Ord. No. 09-02, § 1, 2-16-2009) 
Sec. 98-43. - Intergovernmental cooperation. 
The chief of the fire department or his designee shall coordinate with the county addressing administrator in carrying out the responsibilities set forth in this article to ensure that the purposes of this article are carried to the fullest extent practicable given the particular interests of the city. Among other things, the city shall use the global positioning system (GPS) coordinates of a location identified by the county in determining all addresses. 
(Ord. No. 09-02, § 1, 2-16-2009) 
Sec. 98-44. - Address number assignment. 
Address assignment shall be based upon the type descriptions listed below. Addresses shall be supplied only for habitable structures and devices with existing telephone service. Addresses for proposed habitable structures will be provided only after the final location of ingress and egress to the structure and the final location of the structure are evident on the ground so that the correct and final GPS location of the structure, as an access point can be located. An address will be provided for all final building permit applications. 
(a)  Frontage interval address style. Address numbers shall be assigned to each structure, as defined herein, a "location number" based upon its distance (i.e., the number of 10.56-foot segments) from the origin point of the road to the center point of the access drive. 
(b)  Odd/even number location. Numbers are odd on the left hand side of the road and even on the right side of the road as the numbers increase. 
(c)  Fractional, alphanumeric, hyphenated addresses. There shall be no use of fractional addresses, alphanumeric address numbers or hyphenated address numbers. This also applies to apartment numbers and suite numbers. This also applies to secondary location indicators such as apartment numbers and suite numbers. 
(d)  Component order. Components of a road address shall always be in the following order: address number, directional prefix (if any), road name and road type, designation of apartment or suite, and apartment/suite number. 
(e)  Diagonal roads. Diagonal roads shall be treated as either north-south or east-west roads. Once orientation is established it shall be used throughout the entire length of the road. The orientation will not change even if the road changes direction. Within developments it is advisable to consider the direction of the beginning of the road. 
(f)  Circular roads. A circular road is one that returns to the same origin point or to the same originating road. Circular roads shall be numbered beginning at the low numbered intersection and continuing to the other end of the road. The outside of the circle is numbered first and the inside is then numbered to match and mix with the outside. This will result, in most cases, with fewer numbers on the inside of the circle and with larger spaces between the inside numbers. Numbering sequence of the outside and inside of the circle shall be used throughout the entire length of the road retaining odd/even designations on the appropriate side of the circular road. 
(g)  Cul-de-sacs. Cul-de-sacs shall be addressed using the system based on the baseline/meridian structure; odd/even numbers on the appropriate sides of the road and meeting at the mid-point, or the back of the cul-de-sac. 
(h)  Corner lots. It is preferable for corner lots to be addressed to the road off which the driveway is accessed. However, corner lots have the option of being addressed to the driveway or the front of the structure. Display of address numbers on the structure shall face the road to which the home is addressed. The assigned address will be determined by the site plan presented at the time a building permit is requested. 
(i)  Private drives/easements. Private drives/easements may be addressed to an existing adjoining road when they serve no more than two lots or structures. Private drives and easements serving more than two lots or structures shall be addressed to the private drive/easement. 
(j)  Single-family dwellings. A single-family dwelling shall receive its own individual address determined by the basic rules for distance and direction. 
(k)  Duplexes/apartment residences/office buildings/strip commercial buildings. Structures of this type shall be numbered with the main building receiving one address and each individual unit being assigned unit/suite numbers as secondary location indicators. The unit number assigned should indicate the floor location (e.g., "Unit 204" is the fourth unit on the second floor). Alphanumeric numbers are not permitted. Buildings with multiple entrances, where each entrance provides access to a limited number of units, shall require an address for each individual entrance. Careful planning shall be taken to reserve enough numbers for future divisions of units/suites. 
(l)  Townhouses. Townhouses individually owned and not part of an apartment complex shall be assigned an individual address for each unit as determined by the street allowing main access to the building and following the basic rules for distance and direction. Townhouses under the apartment category will be addressed as apartments, with the main building receiving one address and each individual townhouse being assigned apartment numbers as secondary locators. 
(m)  Condominiums. Condominiums shall be assigned an individual address for each unit as determined by the street allowing main access to the building and following the basic rules for distance and direction. An apartment building or townhouse complex that is converted to a condominium shall be required to be addressed with an individual address for each unit. 
(n)  Miscellaneous/secondary structures. Outbuildings and/or utilities requiring metering or possessing landline telephone service are required to have their own individual address, generally four to six numbers from the main residence. Outbuildings having their own access drive shall be assigned an address following the basic rules for distance and direction. 
(o)  Wireless towers. A wireless tower shall be assigned one address determined by the basic rules for distance and direction. When additional carriers are collocated thereon, all carriers, including the first carrier, will be assigned a suite number with the address. 
(p)  Flag lots. Buildings obtaining access through a panhandle to a public road will be addressed to the public road to which they obtain access. If the lot contains two or more principal structures and share a common access, the access itself shall be named as a road for addressing purposes. 
(q)  Special case lots/parcels. Special case lots developed facing a named road with access provided by a private alley, from a side road, shall be numbered to the facing road. Individual buildings on lots created facing an unnamed driveway shall be addressed off the public street from which it gains access. If the structure is more than 150 feet from the named road or is not visible from the named road, the address number shall be displayed on the structure and at the end of the driveway or easement that provides access to the structures, and be visible and legible from all directions of travel.

ARTICLE VII. - INTERSECTION SIGHT DISTANCE 

Sec. 98-170. - Purpose. 
The purpose of this article is intended to insure that all intersections shall have an unobstructed sight distance along all approaches, creating a vision clearance triangle sufficient to avoid vehicle conflicts for all approaching and departing vehicles, traveling at or less than the maximum speed limit. This is intended to apply to all intersections which would include public and private streets and driveways. 
(Ord. No. 16-07, § 2, 6-6-2016) 
Sec. 98-171. - Street intersection—Sight obstruction. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Code, no person may park vehicles or install, set out, or maintain any sign, structure, fence, wall, hedge, shrubbery, natural growth/terrain, or other obstruction which either individually or collectively obscures an area in excess of 12 inches in width except utility poles or traffic lights or sign posts which impedes the view of motor vehicle operators at a street intersection within the clear sight triangles and between the height limits defined further in this section. The public works director may determine that certain intersections do not require the sight distance mandates of this ordinance. In such instances, parked vehicles shall be permitted only where clearly marked or signed by city government. 
(Ord. No. 16-07, § 2, 6-6-2016) 
Sec. 98-172. - Sight distance required. 
(a)  No sight obstruction, as previously defined, shall be placed or maintained between a height of 2½ feet and a height of ten feet above the upper face of the nearest curb (or grade level at the intersecting street centerline if no curb exists) and within the sight triangle as shown in Figure 1 meeting the required intersection sight distance as designated in Table 1. 
(b)  The vertex (decision point) of the sight triangle on the minor road should be 15 feet from the edge of the major-road traveled way. This represents the typical position of the minor-road driver's eye when a vehicle is stopped relatively close to the major road. 
Figure 1 - Intersection Sight Distance 

Table 1 - Intersection Sight Distance Values 

 
  
1.  The provided intersection sight distance values are required for stopped vehicles to safely cross or turn left onto an intersecting street with traffic moving at the corresponding design speed. Distances are intended as a minimum guideline. Site conditions such as grades, traffic volumes, signalization types, etc. may warrant increases in desired sight distances as directed by the public works director or his or her designee. 
_____
(c)  The sight distance criteria are based on the time required for a passenger vehicle to make a left turn from a stop controlled approach to the City roadway (AASHTO Case B1). The time to execute the maneuver is based on recommendations contained in NCHRP Report 383, Intersection Sight Distance. The sight distances, for a two-lane road, are the distances traveled at the major road speed during 7.5 seconds. The time is increased by 0.5 seconds for each additional lane to be crossed. 
(d)  The sight distances given in Table 1 are for undivided highways and streets. If the highway or street is divided, the effect of the median should be considered in determining the required sight distance. Based on the conditions, it may be feasible for the crossing maneuver to be done in two stages with a stop in the median. However, the intersection should only be treated in this manner if the signing and marking is accordingly provided. Otherwise, the sight distance requirements should be increased to account for the additional width that must be crossed. See AASHTO Green Book, Chapter 9 Intersections, for adjustments due to grades greater than 3 percent and design vehicles other than passenger cars. 
(Ord. No. 16-07, § 2, 6-6-2016) 
Sec. 98-173. - Special sight obstruction cases. 
When obstructions exist which do not comply with this article, but may not be removed without severe hardship to the property owner, the public works director or his or her designee may allow the obstruction to remain so long as the intersection is otherwise reasonably safe and other safety measures are available such as stopping sight distance is obtainable. 
(Ord. No. 16-07, § 2, 6-6-2016) 
Sec. 98-174. - Obstruction declared a nuisance. 
Every obstruction prohibited by this article is deemed a nuisance and may be abated as follows. The city may require an owner of property to remove any and all sight obstructions necessary to meet the required unobstructed sight distance/clear sight triangles as specified herein. In the event an owner of property refuses to remove the sight obstruction upon request, the city may remove the sight obstruction with city forces or in the alternative, may retain the services of a person or persons qualified to so remove the sight obstruction, and bill the owner of the property for any and all expenses incurred. The city shall be under no obligation to reimburse the owners of said property for any loss or damage resulting from said removal.

Sec. 102-5. - Erection of buildings. 
No building permit shall be issued and no building shall be erected on any lot in the county unless the street giving access thereto has been accepted as a public street in accordance with this resolution, or unless such street had attained the status of a public street prior to the effective date of this ordinance or on a street accepted by the governing body. 
(Ord. of 2-20-1967) 
Sec. 102-6. - Definitions. 
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
Building line means a line beyond which no foundation wall or part of the structure of any building shall project, with the exception of roof overhang and the subsurface projection of footings. 
Crosswalk means a right-of-way within a block dedicated to public use, intended primarily for pedestrian use designed to provide access to adjacent roads and lots. 
Health department means the Georgia Department of Public Health and/or the Whitfield County Health Department. 
Lot means a portion of a subdivision intended as a unit for transfer of ownership or for development or both. The word "lot" includes the words "plot" or "parcel." 
Lot width means the width of the lot at the building line measured parallel to the street right-of-way line or in the case of a curvilinear street parallel to the chord of the arc between the intersection of the side lot lines and the street right-of-way line. 
Planning commission means the Dalton-Whitfield County Planning Commission. 
Street means a right-of-way for vehicular whether designated as street, highway, thoroughfare, parkway, road, avenue, drive, expressway, boulevard, lane, place, circle, alley, or otherwise. 
(1)  Interstate principal arterial means interstates and other fully controlled access facilities. 
(2)  Urban principal arterial means streets and highways serving major urban activity centers, the highest traffic volume corridors, the longest trip desires, and a high proportion of total urban area travel on a minimum of mileage. Service to abutting land should be subordinate to the provision of travel service to major traffic movements. This system carries the major portion of trips entering and leaving an urban area, as well as the majority of through movements desiring to bypass the central city, and normally will carry important intra-urban as well as intercity bus routes. 
(3)  Urban minor arterial means streets and highways interconnecting with and augmenting the urban principal arterial system and providing service to trips of moderate length at a somewhat lower level of travel mobility. The system places more emphasis on land access and distributes travel to geographic areas smaller than these identified with the higher system. It includes all arterials not classified as principal. 
(4)  Urban collector street means streets penetrating neighborhoods, collecting traffic from local streets in the neighborhoods, and channeling it into the arterial systems. A minor amount of through traffic may be carried on collector streets, but the system primarily provides land access service and carries local traffic movements within residential neighborhoods, commercial, and industrial areas. It may also serve local bus routes. 
(5)  Local street means streets not classified in a higher system, primarily providing direct access to abutting land and access to the higher systems. They offer the lowest level of mobility and usually carry no bus routes. Service to through traffic is deliberately discouraged. 
(6)  Bypass means a highway designated for fast, continuous movement of all types of traffic between highways and widely separated parts of the urban area. Bypasses generally have limited or controlled access and are usually grade-separated at railroads and major crossings. 
(7)  Alley or service drive means a minor access way used for service access, or property access under specified circumstances, to the back or side of properties otherwise abutting on a street. 
(8)  Marginal access street means a residential street parallel and adjacent to major thoroughfares or arterial streets and which provides access to abutting properties with protection from through traffic. 
(9)  Cul-de-sac means a local street or road with only one outlet and having an appropriate terminal for the safe and convenient reversal of traffic movement. 
(10)  Half-street means a street or road adjacent to a subdivision tract boundary where only half the required right-of-way and road improvements are provided within the proposed subdivision and the responsibility for the other half is undecided or is left to the adjacent property owner. 
Subdivider means and includes any person, firm or corporation or agent who undertakes the subdivision of land as defined in this section. 
Subdivision means the division of a tract or parcel of land into two or more lots, building sites, or other divisions for the purpose, whether immediate or future, of sale, legacy, or building development, and includes all division of land involving a new street or a change in existing streets, and included resubdivision and, where appropriate to the context, relates to the process of subdividing or to the land or areas subdivided; provided, however, that the following are not included within this definition: 
(1)  The combination or recombination of portions of previously platted lots where the total number of lots is not increased and the resultant lots are equal to the standards set forth in these regulations. 
(2)  The division of land into parcels of five acres or more where no new street is involved. 
(3)  The transfer of property by the owner to a member of the immediate family to include within the fifth degree as established by the legal definition. 
(4)  The transfer of unsubdivided land or the transfer of a lot of parcel of land established by deed or plat recorded in the office of the clerk of superior court prior to the effective date of these regulations. 
(5)  The division of land among heirs by judicial decree. 
The planning commission shall have the authority to waive the design criteria of these regulations in cases of subdivisions substantially developed prior to the adoption of these regulations and where notification that the subdivision has been started is made to the planning commission within ten days of the date of adoption. 
Suburban subdivision means a subdivision located outside the City of Dalton which meets all the following criteria: 
(1)  Lot size - 25,000 square feet or larger. 
(2)  Lot width - 125 feet or more.

(1)  Nonresidential blocks. Blocks for other than residential use shall be of such length and width as may be suitable for their prospective use. 
(2)  Residential block length. In order that there may be convenient access between various parts of a subdivision and between the subdivision and surrounding areas; and in order to help prevent traffic congestion and undue inconvenience; the length of blocks hereafter established shall not exceed 1,800 feet or be less than 600 feet. Provided, however, such length requirements may be modified when such shall be appropriate due to the topography or physical shape of the property being subdivided. 
(3)  Residential block width. The width of any residential block shall be sufficient to permit two tiers of lots, where topography and land ownership permits, except as otherwise provided in these regulations. 
(4)  Crosswalks. Rights-of-way for pedestrian crosswalks shall be provided when in the opinion of the planning commission crosswalks are necessary for the convenience of pedestrians. Such rights-of-way shall be not less than ten feet wide.

Appendix A, part I, article XI, is adopted in this subsection by reference. 
(3)  City limit and lot lines. Lots shall not be divided by corporate boundary lines. 
(4)  Corner lots. Corner lots shall be sufficiently large to permit the location of building so as to conform with the building lines on both streets. 
(5)  Double frontage. Double frontage lots (i.e., lots having street frontage both in front and rear) shall be avoided except where essential to provide separation of residential development from railroad or major street rights-of-way or where necessary due to topography. Where a railroad of major arterial right-of-way, as shown on the major thoroughfare plan, abuts or runs through any portion of the subdivision, the subdivision plan shall provide for either a marginal access or lots backing onto said right-of-way having a minimum depth of 200 feet. 
(6)  Lot lines. Insofar as practical, side lot lines shall be at right angles to straight street lines and radial to curved street lines. 
(7)  Minimum lot dimensions and area. The minimum lot with at the front building line and minimum lot area shall be as required in appendix A, part I. Any lot requiring a septic tank shall be governed by the regulations of the county health department. 
(8)  Street access. Every lot hereafter established shall front or abut on a street which is to be dedicated to the public and conforms to the requirements of these regulations. 
(9)  Lot depth. Except in instances of extreme topography or other unusual physical conditions, lot depth shall not be more than four times the lot width at the building line. 
Sec. 102-65. - Easements. 
Easements shall be required in subdivisions for the following purpose: 
(1)  Utility easements. When it is found to be necessary and desirable to locate public utility lines in other than street rights-of-way, easements shall be shown on the plat for such purposes. Such easements shall not be less than 12 feet in width and where possible, shall be centered on rear or side lot lines. 
(2)  Watercourse and drainage easements. Where a proposed subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainage way, or stream, appropriate provisions shall be made to accommodate stormwater and drainage through and from the proposed subdivision. Such easement shall conform substantially with the lines of the watercourse and be of sufficient width or construction, or both, as to be adequate for the purpose. 
(Ord. of 2-20-1967) 
Sec. 102-66. - Variances. 
When, due to the peculiar shape, or the topography of a tract of land or other unusual condition, it is impractical for a developer to comply with the literal interpretations of the design requirements of these regulations, the planning commission shall be authorized to vary such requirements provided the intent and purposes of these regulations are not violated.

Sec. 102-91. - Findings; duty of subdivider. 
A well-designed subdivision means little to a prospective lot buyer until he can see actual physical transformation of raw land into lots with all necessary improvements provided. Likewise a well-designed subdivision is not an asset to the community until the necessary improvements have been installed. In order that prospective lot purchasers may get usable products and new subdivisions may be an asset rather than a liability to the community, the subdivider shall install and/or pay for the improvements required by these regulations necessary to serve his subdivision.

ARTICLE VII. - PERSONAL TRANSPORTATION VEHICLES 

Sec. 114-415. - Findings and intent. 
The mayor and council find that certain streets or designated portions of certain streets located within the territorial boundaries of the city and under its jurisdiction can be authorized for use by operators of personal transportation vehicles ("PTV"). This article shall set forth the conditions for such use of a PTV. 
This article is adopted to address the interest of public safety. Personal transportation vehicles ("PTV") and other similar vehicles are not generally designed or manufactured to be used on public highways, streets and roads, and the City of Dalton in no way advocates their operation on the public roads within its jurisdiction. Adoption of this article is not to be relied upon as a determination by the city that operation of personal transportation vehicles and other similar vehicles on public roads is safe or advisable, even if done in accordance with this article. By regulating such operation, the city is merely addressing obvious safety issues. All persons who operate or ride in personal transportation vehicles and other similar vehicles on public roads do so with their own judgment and at their own risk, and must be observant of, and attentive to the safety of themselves and others, including their passengers, other motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians. Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the city accepts no liability in negligence, nuisance or under any other cause of action for losses resulting from the use of personal transportation vehicles and other similar vehicles on roads, sidewalks, recreation paths, rights-of-way or other public property under this article. Any person who operates personal transportation vehicles and other similar vehicles is responsible for procuring appropriate insurance as may be required by state law or this article as a condition of operating personal transportation vehicles and other similar vehicles on the public roads of the city.

For purposes of this ordinance, Whitfield County is hereby divided into the following zoning districts: 
4-1-1  General agriculture (GA). This district is established to protect and to preserve agricultural and forest resources and associated rural characteristics by allowing only low density residential uses, farming, animal husbandry, forestry, saw milling, and other similar uses upon lots or parcels not less than five acres. No more than two single-family detached dwelling units per lot or parcel shall be allowed in this district. 
4-1-2  Suburban agriculture (SA). This district is established as a transitional district for low density residential uses in conjunction with typical agricultural pursuits primarily for the residents living there, including, but not limited to the growing of food, flowers, the raising of chickens, and the tending of horses and cattle for personal pleasure. Lots and parcels in this district shall be not less than three acres. Only one single family dwelling unit per lot shall be allowed in this district. 
4-1-3  Estate residential (R-1). This district is established to preserve open space in both urban and rural environments and typically rural environments by encouraging larger than average lot formats of at least one acre or more for low density single family detached dwellings in excess of 1,500 square feet heated floor area. There shall be no manufactured or mobile homes within this district, in order to maintain the traditional residential character of such districts. Only one single family dwelling unit per lot shall be allowed in this district. 
4-1-4  Low density single family residential (R-2). This district is established to protect single family detached dwellings, including typical residential subdivisions, on lots of not less than 27,500 square feet if served by on-site sewage management systems and not less than 15,000 square feet if served by public sewer or an approved central on-site sewage management system. All dwellings in this district shall contain in excess of 1,200 square feet of heated floor area upon a permanent foundation and shall have the electrical meter base serving such dwelling attached directly to such dwelling. There shall be no manufactured or mobile homes within this district in order to maintain the traditional residential character of such districts. If served by on-site sewage management system, the lots in this district shall conform at least with the minimum standards for lot sizes as promulgated by the health department or other authority having proper jurisdiction over such minimum lot sizes, as amended from time to time. Only one dwelling unit per lot shall be allowed in this district. 
4-1-5  Medium density single-family residential (R-3). This district is established to protect single-family detached dwellings, typically within a more urban atmosphere, including residential subdivisions, on smaller lots of not less than 7,500 square feet and which are served by public sewer or an approved central on-site sewage management system. All dwellings in this district shall contain not less than 1,000 square feet of heated floor area. There shall be no manufactured or mobile homes within this district, in order to maintain the traditional residential character of such districts. Only one dwelling unit per lot shall be allowed in this district. 
4-1-6  Zero lot line residential (R-4). This district is established for single family detached dwellings, configured upon "zero lot lines," which may be located upon lots at a density of up to ten dwellings per acre, exclusive of right-of-ways or other restrictive easements. Any such lots must be served by public sewer or an approved central on-site sewage management system. Such districts encourage the creation of compatible open spaces for enjoyment by several surrounding dwellings. There shall be no manufactured or mobile homes within this district, in order to maintain the traditional residential character of such districts. Only one dwelling unit per lot shall be allowed in this district. 
4-1-7  Rural residential (R-5). This district is established to protect single family detached dwellings, including typical residential subdivision development of all varieties of housing stock, and duplexes. Manufactured housing in this district shall remove all wheels and the tongue (or hitch,) so as to maintain the site-built residential character of the district. The lots in this zoning district that are served by on-site sewage management systems shall conform at least with the minimum standards for lot sizes as promulgated by the Health department or other authority having proper jurisdiction over such minimum lot sizes, as amended from time to time. The lots in this zoning district that are served by public sewer or an approved central on-site sewage management system shall be not less than 7,500 square feet for a single family dwelling and not less than 10,000 square feet for a duplex. Only one principal structure, containing two dwelling units or less, per lot shall be allowed in this district. 
4-1-8  Transitional residential (R-6). This district is established as a transition residential district of either medium or high density, which may accommodate dwellings such as single family detached dwellings, individual manufactured homes, duplexes, triplexes, or fourplexes only. No more than one principal structure per lot, containing not more than one four unit building shall be allowed in this district. 
4-1-9  High density residential (R-7). This district is established as a high density residential district allowing as many as 20 dwelling units per acre. Multiple structures per lot shall be permitted in this district. Because of the increased density allowed in this district, any such lots must be served by public sewer or an approved central on-site sewage management system. 
4-1-10  Planned unit development (PUD). This district is established to permit greater flexibility and more imaginative design for the development of compatible, multi-use residential and neighborhood commercial land uses on a scale larger than not less than 15 acres. The PUD district is intended to promote an orderly and harmonious variety of housing options, along with higher levels of amenities and preservation of open space. To be considered for the PUD district, a full and complete application for rezoning shall include a preliminary site plan. Establishing a PUD district requires the implementation and adherence to the approved site plan as required by: 1) these regulations; 2) any other applicable regulations; or 3) any conditions resulting from the review process. Once submitted, if there are any material alterations to the site plan, the altered site plan shall be resubmitted. 
4-1-11  Limited commercial (C-1A). This transitional district is established to provide for specific limited commercial uses, including professional service establishments, often conducted within structures converted from residential uses. 
4-1-12  Neighborhood commercial (C-1) . This district is established to provide for limited retail activities and personal or professional services designed to serve the convenience needs of nearby neighborhoods. The size of the buildings and parking allowed in this district are limited to create minimal negative impact upon nearby neighborhoods. This district allows uses which will result in a minimum of traffic from outside the surrounding neighborhoods. 
4-1-13  Mixed use (MU) This transition district is established to provide for appropriate mixed use opportunities on parcels smaller than those required for the PUD district. Typically, such uses would include apartment or condominium style multi-family housing situated above compatible commercial uses at ground level that are intended to serve such residents and the general public. However, the use(s) may also be entirely commercial or light manufacturing, creating more flexibility with respect to access, setbacks, etc., as shown on an approved site plan. To be considered for the MU district, a full and complete application for rezoning shall include a preliminary site plan. Establishing a MU district requires the implementation and adherence to the approved site plan as required by: 1) these regulations; 2) any other applicable regulations; or 3) any conditions resulting from the review process. Once submitted, if there are any material alterations to the site plan, the altered site plan shall be resubmitted. 
4-1-14  General commercial (C-2). This district is established to provide for and to encourage appropriate development along collector and arterial thoroughfares, which includes the broadest mix of commercial retail and service uses with associated storage capabilities, and other commercial activities which will both accommodate the needs of residents and those of the traveling public. Shopping centers and large retail stores would be common, along with a host of supporting commercial uses. 
4-1-15  Central business district (C-3). The central business district is the historic center of town, city, or community for commercial retail and service uses, financial institutions, office, and government uses, with limited residential uses. This district would typically be characterized by shared parking and loading, and by buildings occupying most, if not all, of the lot or parcel on which it is located. The central business district defines the core activity center around which the community has historically developed. 
4-1-16  Transitional commercial (C-4). This district is considered an expansion and transitional area out from the central business district, allowing uses similar to those allowed in the central business district, but with conventional lot designs, requiring off street parking and loading, and typical setbacks. This district is envisioned to accommodate lower traffic, lower visibility commercial operations that are nonetheless near the central business district. 
4-1-17  Light manufacturing (M-1). This district is established to act as a transition between heavy industrial uses and other commercial or residential uses by providing for industrial activities which are more limited in scope, size, or negative impacts upon surrounding properties. Permitted uses in this district will create a minimum of environmental pollution in the form of traffic, noise, odors, smoke, fumes, glare, or heat. 
4-1-18  Heavy Manufacturing (M-2). This district is established to provide suitable areas for general industrial, carpet manufacturing, distribution, or warehousing activities and/or other intensive activities of industrial nature which may generate external traffic and may include moderate amounts of environmental pollution in the form of traffic, noise, odors, smoke, fumes, glare, or heat. 
4-2. - Zoning district map. 
The boundaries of the various zoning districts are shown upon that map designated as the Official Zoning Map of Whitfield County, Georgia, which is sometimes referred to as the "zoning map."

Where district boundary lines are indicated as approximately following lot lines, such lot lines shall be construed to be such boundaries. Wherever any uncertainty exists as to the boundary line of any use district as shown on the zoning map incorporated herein, the following rules shall apply: 
4-3-1  Where a lot held in one ownership contains more than one actual principal use, such actual uses may be delineated and assigned zone designations consistent with such uses within the parcel. The existence of principal uses and the area assigned to such uses shall be based upon objective physical evidence of separate actual uses of the parcel present at the site at which it occurs. Any disputes regarding actual principal uses shall be resolved by the zoning administrator. 
4-3-2  In all other cases, the district boundary lines shall be determined by use of the scale appearing on the official zoning map.

6-5-10  Setbacks and separations. All towers shall comply with the following standards, except that existing alternative tower structures are exempt from the minimum setback and separation requirements of this section; provided, however, that such alternative tower structure must be a conforming use within the zoning district in which it is located for this setback exemption to apply as of right. 
(a)  All towers, regardless of the zoning district in which such tower is proposed to be located, shall set back at least a distance equal to the height of the tower plus 15 feet or 200 total feet, whichever is less, from any dwelling, GA, SA, R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4, R-5, R-6, or R7 zoning district line, or public property, regardless of whether such distance shall cross any public or private right-of-way or roadway. This requirement shall be in addition to but concurrent with all other set backs required by the zoning district in which a proposed tower is to be located. 
(b)  All towers and maintenance/operation structures (including guy wires) shall comply with the setbacks as required by the zoning district in which the tower is to be located. 
6-6. - Buffering tower sites. 
6-6-1  Tower sites shall be landscaped with a buffer of plant materials such that the view of the base of the tower is screened from any public rights-of-way, public property, and any GA, SA, R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4, R-5, R-6, or R-7 zoned property. 
6-6-2  In locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, this landscaping requirement may be reduced or waived altogether by the board of zoning appeals. 
6-6-3  Existing mature growth and natural land forms on the site shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. In some cases, such as when towers are sited upon large, wooded lots, natural growth around the perimeter of the property may be sufficient if so determined by the board of zoning appeals.

ARTICLE VIII. - BUFFERS 

8-1. - Buffer requirement. 
A buffer, as specified herein below, shall be required when a proposed development abuts property in a less intense zone district, unless the adjacent zone district is already developed with uses similar to the proposed uses. Refer to the following table for the required buffer: 

 
TBD - To be determined by the applicable governing body during the special use review approvalprocess. 
8-1-1  Buffers shall be located within and along the outer perimeter of a lot or parcel along the side and/or rear lot lines. Buffers shall not be located upon any portion of existing, dedicated, or reserved public or private road right-of-way. 
8-1-2  No building permit shall issue for any lot or parcel development requiring a buffer until such time as that buffer, as specified herein, shall be substantially in place or until acceptable surety for the cost of the buffer installation shall be provided to the building inspector. Acceptable surety shall consist either of an irrevocable letter of credit from an approved lending institution or a performance bond from an approved insurer in an amount not less than fifteen dollars ($15.00) per linear foot of area to be buffered. The required buffer must be completed and in place within 30 days before any such surety shall lapse or within six months of the issuance of the building permit, whichever shall occur sooner. 
8-1-3  If the required buffer shall not be completed and in place as set forth herein, then, in such circumstance, the zoning administrator or designee shall have authority to go upon such areas of the subject parcel as reasonable and necessary to construct the required buffer, utilizing the surety previously provided. The Governing Authority shall not be liable for such action unless the Zoning Administrator or his or her designee shall act with gross negligence in coming upon and/or damaging such parcel.

8-3. - More intense use must provide buffer. 
When adjoining properties are zoned in dissimilar use districts, the property within the more intensive use district shall be required to provide the buffer. However, when adjoining vacant parcels are in dissimilar use districts, no buffer is required when the parcel zoned for the less intensive use seeks a building permit. 
8-4. - General buffer design. 
All buffers required by this Article shall conform to the following specifications: 
8-4-1  Prior to development, a buffer plan shall be required to show the types and locations of all screening devices within a required buffer. If a site development plan is required, a buffer plan may be incorporated as part of the site development plan. 
8-4-2  Landscaping within buffer areas shall be used to screen objectionable views or nuisances, such as parking and service areas, refuse containers, air conditioning units and transformers. Existing on-site plantings may be credited as landscaped open space meeting the requirements of this section if such plant materials achieve the purposes of this section. 
8-5. - Zoning buffer standards. 
8-5-1  General. 
(a)  Buffer areas shall contain no driveways, access easements, parking areas, patios, storm water detention facilities, or any other structures or accessory uses except for a fence, wall or earthen berm constructed to provide the visual screening required to meet the standards of this article. 
(b)  Underground utilities including closed storm drains may be permitted to cross perpendicular to a buffer if the screening standards of this article will be subsequently achieved. 
(c)  Vehicular access through a buffer may be allowed only as a condition of rezoning, Special Use or Planned Unit Development zoning approval by the Governing Authority. 
8-5-2  Minimum required screening. A required zoning buffer must create a barrier that substantially blocks the sight lines, noise transmission, and the transfer of artificial light and reflected light up to a height of not less than six feet at the property line (or such greater height as required by conditions of zoning approval on a particular property). 
8-5-3  Natural buffers. Natural buffers shall be composed of healthy plants with growth characteristics to produce a dense, compact visual screen not less than six feet in height. Natural buffers may contain deciduous or perennial vegetation, but shall contain existing or planted evergreen shrubs and trees suitable to local growing conditions that will provide an opaque visual screen during all seasons of the year. 
8-5-4  Structural buffers. A structural buffer shall provide a continuous visual screen throughout its entire length, and may consist of any combination of the following, as approved by the zoning administrator: Opaque fencing constructed of cedar, redwood, treated and stained or painted wood, vinyl replicating wood, or other suitable all-weather material; masonry walls of brick or stone; concrete block walls treated with a decorative finish; planted or natural vegetation; or earthen berms. Structural buffers shall meet the following criteria: 
(a)  Structural buffers shall be vegetated throughout the minimum area required for the buffer around any fences or walls and upon any earthen berms, which may include ground covers, shrubs and trees, and areas that are mulched. 
(b)  All earthen berms shall have a maximum side slope of 50 percent [one foot of vertical rise to two feet of horizontal run.] Earthen berms shall not be constructed within the drip line of any existing trees that will remain on the property; new trees that overhang the berm may be planted after the berm is constructed. 
(c)  Trees shall be located or planted within any structural buffer at a density of not less than one tree for each 25 feet of buffer length or portion thereof (or every 35 feet for shade trees). New deciduous trees shall have a caliper of not less than two inches upon planting, and new evergreens shall be at least six feet tall when planted. Trees may be clustered following professional landscaping standards for spacing, location and design 
(d)  Fences and freestanding walls shall present a finished and decorative appearance to the abutting property, and shall be located not closer to the property line than two feet. Shrubs, ground covers, or other vegetation shall be provided between the fence or wall and the property line so as to provide a decorative effect, following professional landscaping standards for spacing, location and design. 
(e)  Examples of buffers are shown in the following illustration: 

8-6. - Maintenance of buffers. 
Every buffer required under this article shall be maintained by the owner of the property where the buffer is located, so as to provide an opaque visual screen to a height of six feet on a continuous, year-round basis. Dead or dying plants or trees must be replaced immediately with the same or an equivalent species. 
8-7. - Reduction for unnecessary buffers. 
The governing authority may reduce a zoning buffer requirement to a temporarily appropriate level of screening if the comprehensive plan anticipates future development on the adjoining property in a land use category such that a zoning buffer would not be required or may be reduced by this ordinance once the adjoining property is rezoned or developed. Such determination shall be based upon the future development map in the Comprehensive Plan, surrounding land use and zoning patterns, and the propriety of a future zoning change on the adjoining property. 
8-8. - Variances. 
The requirements of this Article may be altered, amended, or waived by the board of zoning appeals, depending upon circumstances, if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence either that the existing topography and/or vegetation will achieve the purposes of the Article or that, because of the topography, no required screening device could screen the ground level activities of the more intense use from the ground level activities of the abutting less intense use. 
ARTICLE IX. - NON-CONFORMING USE, STRUCTURE, OR LOT 

9-1. - [Limitations on non-conforming uses.] 
Any use of land legally established at the time of enactment or subsequent amendment of this Ordinance, which would not be permitted as a new use in the zone district in which it is located, or any structure or accessory structure which is legally established at the time of enactment or subsequent amendment of this ordinance and is not built in conformity with the current requirements of this ordinance, or any lot of record whose area, frontage, width or other dimensions, or location which no longer meets or exceeds one or more such requirements of the applicable zoning district, may be continued pursuant to compliance with all of the following limitations: 
9-1-1  A non-conforming use may not be changed, altered, or amended to any other non-conforming use. 
9-1-2  A non-conforming use may not be re-established after discontinuance of such use for a period of 12 months. 
9-1-3  A non-conforming use, structure, or accessory structure may not be enlarged beyond its size at the time it shall become non-conforming, nor shall the intensity of the use therein increase. This provision shall include, but shall not be limited to, the size of the building, the use of additional land, or the use of additional or more powerful equipment. Approval for such expansion of a non-conforming use shall require a successful rezoning of the lot or parcel in order to bring such use or parcel into compliance with this Ordinance. This provision shall not apply to any residential addition onto an existing non-conforming single family dwelling, provided such addition does not further encroach upon the required setback area. This provision also shall not apply to the replacement of an existing, non-conforming mobile or manufactured home used for residential purposes with another manufactured home, with the same or fewer bedrooms. 
9-1-4  A non-conforming structure may be rebuilt, altered without enlargement or expansion in any sense, repaired, or replaced at a size, use, or impact not larger than the original size and in substantially the same location for the same use within 12 months following damage or loss to such structure. This provision, however, shall not apply to condemnation or voluntary demolition, the effect of which shall be immediate forfeiture of the non-conforming use upon the affected lot or parcel or portion thereof. 
ARTICLE X. - ADMINISTRATION, ENFORCEMENT, AND PENALTIES 

10-1. - Administration by zoning administrator's office.

The governing authority shall then determine whether it shall cause such condition(s) to be brought into compliance with the provisions of this ordinance, as the particular facts may warrant, and whether it shall cause the costs of such efforts to be charged against the lot or parcel upon which the condition existed as a real property lien and/or cause to be levied as a special tax against the land upon which such conditions existed and/or to recover such costs in an action at law against the owner of such lot or parcel. 
10-10. - Adoption and amendments. 
The governing authorities of Whitfield County and the municipalities of Dalton and Varnell shall adopt this ordinance and the zoning map that is part of this ordinance only after public notice(s) and public hearing(s) and final action of each governing authority, as required by the adopted zoning procedures and standard ordinance of the respective governments. 
Further, the governing authorities may from time to time amend the text of this ordinance or the official zoning map that is part of this ordinance, according to the procedures in their respective zoning procedures and standards ordinance. 
10-10-1  Application process. Any amendment to the text of this ordinance or the zoning map or any final action upon any other zoning decision shall begin upon an application form. Annexations shall begin on a form provided by the respective municipal governments and all other zoning decisions shall begin on a form provided by the zoning administrator.

Failure to comply with the requirements of the application shall constitute an incomplete application which will not be processed for conclusion of the requested final zoning decision. An application fee, which is established by the governing authority of the county or the municipalities, as applicable, may apply and be adjusted from time to time. Failure of the zoning administrator or city clerks, as applicable, to collect a fee from the governing authority or the respective municipalities or from the planning commission (or equivalent), when they are initiating a proposed zoning decision, shall not void the validity of the application. 
10-11. - Conflict with other laws.

Whenever the provisions of any other statute require more restrictive standards than are required by this Ordinance, the provisions of such statute shall govern. 
10-12. - Separability. 
Should any section or provision of this ordinance be declared by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unconstitutional or invalid, such declaration shall not affect the validity of the ordinance as a whole or any part thereof other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. 
10-13. - Repeal of conflicting ordinances and validity of prior approvals and actions. 
All ordinances and parts of ordinances in conflict herewith are repealed.

11-2. - Powers and duties. 
The board shall have the following powers and duties: 
11-2-1  To hear and to decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by any representative, officer, or agent of the applicable governing authority. Any such reversal shall be based upon reliable evidence adduced at the hearing, as provided for below, that such decision was erroneous under the facts as the board finds them to be and under the board's reasonable interpretation of the provisions of this ordinance; 
11-2-2  To authorize, upon request in specific cases, such variance from the regulations or requirements of this ordinance, as the case may be, as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of the ordinance will, in such individual case, result in unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of the ordinance shall be observed, public welfare and safety secured, and substantial justice done. In order to grant a variance from the requirements of this ordinance, the board must find that every one of the following conditions is met: 
(a)  There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape, or topography; 
(b)  The application of this ordinance to the particular piece of property would create an unnecessary hardship; 
(c)  Such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of property involved; 
(d)  Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purposes and intent of this ordinance, provided, however, that no variance may be granted for the use of land or building or structure which is prohibited by this ordinance or for an increase in the density allowed by this ordinance. 
(e)  The applicant must provide either formal or informal written evidence that the intended use, if a variance were granted, would be allowed, either by the Whitfield County Health Department or Dalton Utilities, as applicable, with respect to wastewater treatment.

Any such fee shall be paid with the filing of the notice of appeal or variance request. 
11-3-1  The request for an appeal or variance shall be either hand delivered or mailed and must be received by the office of the zoning administrator on or before the 30th day following denial of a permit.

11-3-4  A timely filed appeal or variance request shall stay all legal proceedings in furtherance of the action from which the appeal is taken unless the zoning administrator or his/her agent shall certify by sworn affidavit, a copy of which shall be provided to the appellant, that a stay would cause imminent peril to life and/or property. In such circumstance, there shall be no stay unless ordered by any court of competent jurisdiction. 
11-3-5  At least 15 days but not more than 45 days prior to the public hearing date, a written notice shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation within the territorial boundaries of the county, setting forth the time, place, and purpose of the hearing. In addition, a sign shall be placed in a conspicuous location upon the lot or parcel for which a variance is sought, setting forth the time, place, and purpose of the public hearing. Acts of vandalism or natural occurrences limiting the effectiveness of such notice shall not invalidate any proceeding or action taken upon the proposed variance. 
11-3-6  The appellant may represent himself or herself before the board or may be represented by an attorney at law, a registered land surveyor, and/or other engineers or professionals, as he or she deems appropriate or helpful. The appellant may not be represented by a layperson unless such person shall be the appellant's attorney-in-fact. 
11-3-7  The order of proceeding shall be as follows: An authorized representative of the office of the zoning administrator shall first present all of his or her reasons for the order, requirement, decision, or determination being appealed or requested for a variance. In presenting said reasons, such representative shall present all of the findings of fact and conclusions of law that form the bases for said decision. Then the individual appellant shall present his or her grounds for requesting a waiver or variance, calling witnesses if desired. Any member of the Board may question any witness at any point during the proceeding. Following all witnesses, either side may present rebuttal testimony. At the conclusion of the evidence, the chair may give both sides an opportunity to summarize briefly if the chair shall deem it helpful. 
11-3-8  Hearings before the Board shall not be governed by the strict rules of evidence as in a court of law, though the chair shall be empowered to disallow any evidence or testimony deemed by him or her to be irrelevant, speculative, or otherwise inappropriate to the issues being heard. Any remark amounting to an attack upon the character or personal integrity of another individual or comment not actually supportable or comment in the form of an emotional outburst shall be non-germane to the purpose of the hearing and shall be ruled out of order by the chair. The chair shall have the authority to remove or censure any person who continues to make such comments or who is otherwise disruptive to the hearing process. 
11-3-9  The deliberation and vote by the board must be made in open session, either upon motion and second at the meeting at which the appeal or variance request is presented or at any subsequent regular or special called meeting of the board. The board shall make a decision not later than either 35 days following the initial hearing upon any appeal or variance request or 90 days from the time the application for appeal or variance is filed with the office of the zoning administrator, or said request shall be deemed granted. 
The appellant shall be notified in writing at the address provided in the appeal or variance request within 15 days of the decision of the board. 
11-3-10  Should the individual appellant desire to appeal any decision of the board, he or she must do so by writ of certiorari directly to the Whitfield County Superior Court within 30 days of such decision. There shall be no intermediate appeal to the applicable governing authority, or to any other administrative body. 
11-3-11  Any appellant whose appeal or variance request shall be denied by the board shall be required to wait not less than six months before seeking an appeal or variance for the same real property and/or for the same or similar request.

The City of Dalton delegates to the Dalton-Whitfield County Planning Commission the authority to conduct any public hearing required by O.C.G.A. § 36-66-4.

1-7.1  The chairman of the Dalton-Whitfield County Planning Commission or his or her designee (hereinafter, "the chair") shall open the hearing(s) with an explanation of the purpose of the hearing(s) and a description of the general rules for the conduct of the hearing(s). The chair may describe the authority and role of both the Dalton Whitfield County Planning Commission, in providing a recommendation only, and of the governmental authority, for final action, in any zoning decision. An individual requesting to be heard upon a matter germane to the purpose of the hearing must be called and recognized by the chair before addressing the joint panel. The chair shall determine the germaneness of any proposed comment or presentation and is authorized to rule any individual or portion of the presentation out of order if not germane to the published purpose of the hearing. Any person recognized by the chair, shall first state his name and residence address before proceeding with any comment, remarks, or presentation. Any person addressing the joint panel shall respond to questions from the chair or anyone he or she shall recognize. The chair may predetermine the length of any hearing, allotting equal time to proponents and opponents of any proposed amendment to the zoning ordinance and/or zoning map or special use to the extent that there are both proponents and opponents who desire to be heard. The chair shall be required to offer equal time to both the proponents and opponents of any proposed amendment to the zoning ordinance and/or zoning map or special use and the fact that equal time is not in fact utilized by either shall not invalidate any proceeding or action taken upon any proposed amendment to the zoning ordinance and/or zoning map or special use. The chair, however, shall allow a minimum time period no less than ten minutes per side for the presentation of data, evidence, and opinion. 
1-7.2  A proposed amendment to the Zoning ordinance and/or zoning map or special use applications may be called in any order in the discretion of the chair. The chair shall confirm that proper public notice of the public hearing(s) in accordance with the provisions or this article has been given prior to taking any comments from the public. 
1-7.3  The chair shall allow the person initiating the proposed amendment to the zoning ordinance and/or zoning map or special use, or his or her designee (hereinafter, "the applicant,") to present a description of the request and the reason(s) supporting it. The failure of the applicant to be present for the hearing when called shall result in an automatic continuance in the public hearing thereon until the next regular monthly meeting of the Dalton-Whitfield County Planning Commission, with public notice thereof to all in attendance. Additionally, the zoning administrator shall re-post the sign setting forth the new public hearing date. The failure of the applicant to be present for the hearing when called at the next meeting of the Dalton-Whitfield County Planning Commission shall result in an automatic negative decision from the governing authority when such request shall come before it. 
1-7.4  The chair shall enter into the record after the presentation of the applicant any written comment, petition or similar written statement, photographs, or any other evidence submitted during the public hearing and such documents and/or exhibits shall be considered by the Dalton-Whitfield County Planning Commission, and subsequently by the governing authority in its analysis of the relevant zoning standards and factors as set forth in section 1-8 or 1-9 of this ordinance, as applicable. 
1-7.5  The chair shall then give persons opposed to the proposed amendment to the zoning ordinance and/or zoning map or special use the opportunity to address the assembled panel. 
1-7.6  The chair may then alternate the presentation of persons speaking in favor of and opposed to the proposal, beginning with the applicant, or the chair may divide such presentation into blocks of time beginning with the proponents and thereafter move into the presentation of the opponents, if any. The chair may poll the public assemblage at the hearing concerning its concurrence with the remarks of any speaker. 
1-7.7  Any remark amounting to an attack on the character or personal integrity of another individual or comment not actually supportable or comment in the form of emotional outburst shall be non germane to the purpose of the hearing and may be ruled out of order. The chair shall have the power to remove or censure any person who continues to make any remarks amounting to an attack on the character or personal integrity of another individual or any comment not factually supportable or any comment in the form of emotional outburst during the proceeding. 
1-7.8  Upon the conclusion of the presentation of persons, if any, opposing the proposed amendment to the Zoning ordinance and/or zoning map or special use, the chair may grant to the applicant an allotted time for rebuttal of any new issues raised by opponents, if any. The chair may rule out of order the raising of any new issues in rebuttal unless he or she shall determine that the raising of such new issue is useful to the purpose of the hearing, in which case opponents, if any, shall be allotted an equal amount of time to address such issue(s). 
1-7.9  When the applicant/proponent(s) and opponents, if any, have been heard in accordance with the foregoing procedures, the chair shall declare the public hearing closed. No further public hearing upon the proposed amendment to the zoning ordinance and/or zoning map or special use shall be permitted prior to the final zoning decision by the governing authority, unless the governing authority shall determine that such public hearing should be re-opened for the presentation of additional information, in which case the same must be advertised in conformity with subsection 1-5.1. 
Section 1-8. - Zoning standards. 
Exercise of zoning power by the governing authority shall constitute an effort to balance the interests of Whitfield County in promoting the public health, safety, morality, and/or general welfare against the right of lot or parcel owners to the unrestricted use of their lot or parcel. The following factors are determined to be relevant in balancing the interest and promoting the public health, safety, morality, and/or general welfare against the right to unrestricted use of lot or parcel: 
1-8.1  Factors for consideration in zoning decision. The following factors are determined to be relevant in balancing the interests in promoting the public health, safety, morality and/or general welfare against the right to unrestricted use of property: 
(a)  Whether the proposed amendment would allow a use that is generally suitable for the site compared to other possible uses and the uses and zoning of adjacent and nearby properties. 
(b)  Whether the proposed amendment would adversely affect the economic value or the uses of adjacent and nearby properties. 
(c)  Whether the property has a reasonable economic use as currently zoned, considering the suitability of the subject property for the proposed zoned uses. 
(d)  Whether there is relative gain to the health, safety, morals, or general welfare of the public as compared to any hardship imposed upon the individual owner under the existing zoning. 
(e)  Whether the proposed amendment, if adopted or approved, would result in a use which would or could cause an excessive or burdensome use of existing streets, schools, sewers, water resources, police and fire protection, or other utilities, as contrasted with the impact under the existing zoning. 
(f)  Whether the property sought to be rezoned (or annexed) is in conformity with the policy and intent of the adopted joint comprehensive plan or equivalent. If not, has the plan already been amended, officially or unofficially, by the development of uses which are contrary to the plan recommendation, and if the plan has been amended, does this rezoning or annexation request allow uses which are compatible to the existing uses in the vicinity. 
(g)  Whether there are any other conditions or transitional patterns affecting the use and development of the property to be rezoned or annexed, which give grounds for approval or disapproval of the proposed zoning proposal. Whether the proposed zoning change constitutes an "entering wedge" and is a deterrent to the use, improvement, or development of adjacent property within the surrounding zone districts or would create an isolated, unrelated district (spot zone) as interpreted by current Georgia law. 
(h)  Whether the subject property, as currently zoned, is vacant and undeveloped for a long period of time, considered in the context of land development in the vicinity or whether there are environmental or cultural factors, like steep slopes, flood plain, storm water, or historical issues, that influence the development of the subject property under any zoning designation. 
1-8.2  The governing authority shall consider any proposed zoning amendment properly initiated in light of the factors set forth in section 1 8.1. In evaluating the factors set forth in 1 8.1, it shall be the policy of the governing authority to exercise its zoning power in conformity with the policy intent of the joint comprehensive plan for Whitfield County and the cities of Dalton and Varnell insofar as that plan is current in its application to the specific subject lot or parcel sought to be rezoned. It is further the policy of the governing authority to exercise the zoning power for the purposes of assuring the compatibility of use of adjacent and nearby properties and the preservation of the economic value of adjacent, abutting, and nearby properties while enabling a reasonable use of all lot or parcel within the territorial boundaries of the governmental entity. 
Section 1-9. - Special use standards. 
As set forth in section 10-10-1 of the unified zoning ordinance, a request for a special use shall be duly evaluated pursuant to the following factors, which are intended to be objective in character: 
1-9.1  Factors for consideration of special uses. 
(a)  Whether the proposed use would impact upon anticipated traffic volume and/or traffic flow and/or pedestrian safety within the vicinity; 
(b)  Whether the hours and manner of operation of the proposed use would impact upon nearby properties and uses within the vicinity; 
(c)  Whether parking, loading/service, and/or refuse areas of the proposed use would impact upon nearby properties and uses within the vicinity, particularly with regard to noise, light, glare, smoke, and/or odor; 
(d)  Whether the height, size, and/or location of any proposed structure is compatible with the height, size, and/or location of structure(s) upon nearby properties and uses within the vicinity; 
(e)  Whether the size of the lot or parcel is sufficiently large for the proposed use, and for reasonable growth opportunity of such proposed use, within the parameters of the Zoning Ordinance and within the probable limits of the soils thereon if an on site sewage system is to be installed; 
(f)  Whether the benefits of and need for the proposed use are, on balance, greater than reasonable anticipated depreciating effects and/or damages, if any, to nearby properties within the vicinity. 
Section 1-10. - Official action by the governing authority. 
Consideration of any proposed amendment to the zoning ordinance and/or zoning map or special use properly initiated and subsequent to the public hearing(s) shall be as follows: 
1-10.1  After the close of all the public hearings, the Dalton Whitfield County Planning Commission shall make a recommendation, which shall later be reduced to writing, to the applicable governmental authority, as to the advisability of adoption of any proposed amendment to the zoning ordinance and/or zoning map or special use, and which shall be based upon the factors set forth in section 1-8 or 1-9, as applicable. 
1-10.2  If consideration of any proposed amendment to the zoning ordinance and/or zoning map or special use shall be tabled by the Dalton Whitfield County Planning Commission, it shall be reconsidered not later than its next regular monthly meeting. Under any circumstances, however, if no recommendation shall be forthcoming within 60 days of the date upon which the advertisement of the public hearing referenced in section 1-5.1 hereinabove, it shall be deemed that the recommendation of the Dalton Whitfield County Planning Commission shall have been favorable to the request. 
1-10.3  The authority of the Dalton Whitfield County Planning Commission regarding any zoning decision shall be advisory only. However, the governing authority shall await either such recommendation or the 60 days referenced in section 1-10.2 hereinabove prior to taking final action upon any such proposed amendment to the zoning ordinance and/or zoning map or special use. 
1-10.4  If the governing authority shall take official action defeating a proposed amendment to the zoning map which seeks to rezone a lot or parcel or special use, the same property may not be considered again for rezoning or for a special use until the expiration of 12 months from the date of the official action of the governing authority. This subsection shall specifically include, but not be limited to, an automatic denial due to the failure of the applicant to appear at the public hearing when called. 
Section 1-11. - Annexation of unincorporated islands by municipalities. 
In order to accommodate the timing requirements of state law concerning the annexation of unincorporated islands, the following procedure will be used for such annexations. 
1-11.1  Prior submission to commission not required.

Any person, upon being recognized by the mayor will give his/her name and residence address before making any comment, remark, or presentation. Any person recognized shall respond to questions from the governing authority. The mayor may pre-determine the length of any hearing and allot equal time to proponents and opponents of the proposed annexation and rezoning. The fact that equal time is not utilized by either the proponents or opponents shall not invalidate any proceeding or final action taken by the governing authority. Provided, however, the proponents of annexation and the opponents of annexation shall be allowed a minimum aggregate time period of not less than ten minutes per side for presentation of data, evidence, or opinion. Any person may present written comments concerning the proposed annexation to the mayor and council by submittal to the city clerk not later than the close of the public hearing.

ARTICLE I. - PURPOSE AND SCOPE 

Sec. [1.1] - Purpose and scope. 
The purpose of this ordinance is to provide standards to safeguard public health, property, and welfare by regulating the location, size, illumination, construction, erection, maintenance, and quality of materials of all exterior signs, and to ensure that signs will not confuse, mislead, or obstruct the vision necessary for traffic and pedestrian safety. 
The City of Dalton ("city") acknowledges, too, that preservation of the health, safety, morals, and welfare of the citizenry of the city requires the preservation and protection of the visual attractiveness and aesthetic characteristics of existing streets and neighborhoods throughout the community. Signage controls are included in this ordinance to further the aesthetic values of the community by: 
(1)  Protecting neighborhood property values; 
(2)  Maintaining the traditional character of historic neighborhoods and districts; 
(3)  Avoiding the visual degradation of the city's irreplaceable scenic and environmental resources; and 
(4)  Promoting city's continued economic growth by encouraging high quality commercial development. 
Reasonable, orderly, and effective display of signs provides vital support for economic development and helps create a positive community image that will attract desirable business and industry to the Dalton area. The uncontrolled use of signs with their variable sizes, heights, and illumination demand attention to help avoid potential dangers to moving traffic and pedestrians. In addition, uncontrolled sign placements can be destructive to adjacent property values so that clutter replaces the intrinsic values of the property and diminishes the effectiveness of the signs as they compete with each other. Absent regulations, competition among competing sign owners for visibility of their signs undermines the sign owner's original purpose of presenting a clear message to the public. 
For these reasons, it has become necessary in the public interest to regulate the sizes, heights, locations, types, and other pertinent physical features of exterior signs in the city while simultaneously acknowledging free speech as a First Amendment constitutional right. Balancing the rights of individuals to convey their messages through signs, while protecting the right of the public against unrestricted proliferation of signs, is acknowledged as the goal of the city. Such reasonable regulations also further the policy implementation of the city's adopted comprehensive plan, especially regarding impacts on quality land use development in the area.

Sec. 4.3 - Temporary signs. 
Signage may periodically be needed for a short duration rather than permanent usage. To avoid the unfettered proliferation of signage that could easily contribute to litter and blight to the detriment of property values and business opportunity in all zone districts, the city finds it necessary to manage such signage with the issuance of permits that are tied to a prescribed set of rules for the various signs that may fall in this particular category. These signs shall not be erected within the public right-of-way and shall be located on private property with the permission of the property owner. Only one permit shall be issued to cover all temporary signs. 
The maximum number of temporary permits to be issued to a single parcel in a multi-family, commercial, or industrial district shall be four per year for a period of time not to exceed 30 days for each permit issued. No more than one temporary permit shall be issued per calendar quarter per applicant. 
Banners are allowable as temporary signs.

Sec. 4.4 - Signs exempt from permit requirements. 
4.4-1 The following types of signs shall be exempt from the permit requirements of section 8.1 of this ordinance: 
(a)  Freestanding sign, having a sign area of less than 15 square feet, provided it is not located in the public right-of-way, does not block vehicle sight visibility, does not exceed three feet in height if a ground sign, or, if a pole sign, does not exceed six feet in height. 
(b)  Temporary window sign. Provided, however, the aggregate sign area (permanent and/or temporary window signs) shall not exceed 30 percent of the available window space. 
(c)  Seasonal displays located outside of the public right-of-way that are erected for a maximum period of 30 days no more than twice a year. 
4.4-2 Flagpoles in residential zoned districts shall not exceed 25 feet in height or the height of the primary structure, whichever is less. Flagpoles in commercial or industrial zoned districts shall not exceed 60 feet in height. The dimensions of any flag shall be proportional to the flagpole height such that the hoist side of the flag shall not exceed 50 percent of the vertical height. 
(Ord. No. 09-04, § 1, 4-6-2009) 
Sec. 4.5 - Use of signs by zone districts.

(b)  Other than subdivision entrance signs allowed under subsection (a) above, parcels located in residential zoning districts shall not contain signs having an aggregate sign area greater than 15 square feet. No individual sign shall exceed six square feet in sign area in a residential zoning district. Signs having a height of greater than six feet above the grade level of the centerline of the adjacent street to which the parcel on which the sign is located shall not be located in residential zoning districts. 
4.5-2 Commercial/industrial districts.

(3)  Unless otherwise stated in this ordinance, parcels less than 30,000 square feet in size shall be allowed a maximum aggregate sign area of 100 square feet for the entire parcel. 
(4)  These limits shall include the area of all freestanding signs on the parcel. 
(b)  Residential uses in the commercial and industrial districts shall comply with the signage requirements of subsection 4.5-1. 
(Ord. No. 09-04, § 1, 4-6-2009) 
Sec. 4.6 - Billboard signs. 
4.6-1 Billboard signs are allowed on commercial or industrial zoned parcels within the interstate corridor as provided herein. 
4.6-2 The display area and trim of a billboard sign shall not exceed 12 feet in height and 50 feet in length or a display area in excess of 600 square feet.

(Ord. No. 09-04, § 1, 4-6-2009) 
ARTICLE V. - HISTORIC DISTRICT SIGNAGE 
This article applies only to historic districts officially designated by the mayor and council, now and in the future. The mayor and council have determined that the historical, cultural and aesthetic heritage of the city is among its most valued and important assets. In order to protect and preserve the historic districts of the city it is necessary to enact special regulations exclusively for said historic districts. 

Sec. 5.1 - General regulations. 
5.1-1 All definitions and other matters relating to signs as contained in other existing city ordinances shall remain in full force and effect to the extent that they are consistent with this ordinance. Restrictions and regulations specified under article IV of this ordinance apply within historic districts unless specific exceptions are made for the historic district. 
5.1-2 Any sign proposed within a historic district is subject to design review by the building inspector. 
5.1-3 Compatibility of signage with building architecture. Signage shall not be allowed to obscure any significant architectural details of a building face, nor shall a wall sign be allowed to cover existing windows. 
5.1-4 Variances and appeals procedures. Sign-related appeals of negative findings by the historic preservation commission will be exempt from the appeals procedure described in section P of the city's historic preservation ordinance. The city zoning board of appeals will hear all sign related appeals. Appeals of negative findings by the historic preservation commission must be filed in writing with both the historic preservation commission and the zoning board of appeals no later than 15 days after the historic preservation commission mails the applicant a written notice stating that his application for a certification of appropriateness has been denied. 
5.1-5 Property lines. No sign shall be closer than 18 inches to the adjacent property lines. Signs shall not be installed or extend over a party wall. 
(Ord. No. 09-04, § 1, 4-6-2009) 
Sec. 5.2 - Types of permitted signs. 
5.2-1 Canopy and wall signs. The maximum combined square footage of wall and canopy signs placed on the facade of a building by any business will be 150 square feet for one or two story building and 200 square feet for buildings of three stories or more, or ten percent of the building facade area, whichever is less. 
For each business occupying an entire building, the sign area of any wall sign or canopy sign (or any combination of wall and canopy signs) placed on a building facade may not exceed ten percent of the building facade area. The "building facade area" is calculated by multiplying the height of the facade by the width of the facade and subtracting the area devoted to windows. (See Illustration No. 1.) 

For any building which houses multiple businesses, the "building facade area" used to calculate maximum size of wall and canopy signs allowed for each business will be defined as the individual business's linear frontage (on the primary facade) less the area of any window glass, times the height of the building as measured at its highest point above the business's frontage. (See Illustration No. 2). 
Illustration No. 2  MULTIPLE BUSINESSES IN A SINGLE BUILDING 


 
5.2-2 Window signs. For a ground level business, 15 percent of the total window area parallel to the street may be used as one of the allowable signs. No single window may be covered in excess of 30 percent. Window signs on or above the second floor are prohibited except when a business has no ground floor frontage. 
Window signs on the second floor will be limited to identification and instructional signs which cover no more than 15 percent of the entire window area above the ground floor and no more than 30 percent of any one window. 
5.2-3 Ground signs. In zoning districts that allow freestanding signs, a ground sign may be used provided that the following additional restrictions apply to ground signs within historic districts: 
(1)  Not internally illuminated; 
(2)  Constructed of materials consistent with the building architecture. 
5.2-4 Illuminated signs. Except, in residential zoning districts, signs may be illuminated internally or with indirect lighting provided that indirect light sources are shielded from other buildings and do not create glare or visual discomfort to pedestrians at street level. Neon window and wall signs are permitted as long as they conform to the restrictions listed under subsection 5.3-6. 
5.2-5 Projecting signs. Projecting signs shall be allowed in the downtown historic district provided such signs are in compliance with the following criteria: 
(a)  Only one projecting sign shall be allowed per business, except for a business occupying a corner lot; and only one projecting sign shall be allowed when two or more businesses share a single entrance door. The business on the corner lot shall not have more than one projecting sign on any building wall. 
(b)  The projecting sign shall be installed over the primary entrance door or adjacent to the doorway or windows. The building inspector shall take into account the architectural and structural elements in determining the optimal sign location. 
(c)  A projecting sign shall be installed perpendicular to the building facade. For a business on a corner, a projecting sign may be installed on the corner at a 45-degree angle to each building facade and such sign shall count as two of the allowed four signs for a corner business. Only one 45-degree projecting sign shall be allowed per corner. 
(d)  The display area of a projecting sign shall not exceed six square feet, including the frame, and the horizontal dimension of the display area shall not exceed three feet. 
(e)  The distance from the building wall to the innermost edge of the projecting sign shall not exceed 12 inches. The distance from the ground to the lower edge of the projecting sign shall be a minimum of eight feet over the sidewalk or pedestrian walkway and a minimum of 13 feet over a street, alley, or driveway. The height of the top edge of the sign shall not exceed the height of the wall from which the sign projects if attached to a single-story building, or the height of the sill or bottom of any second story window if attached to a multi-story building. 
(f)  A projecting sign shall be externally lighted only; however, internal lighting is acceptable if such lighting is limited to the sign copy only. (Example: neon, silhouette/backlighting, or individual lighted letters) 
(g)  The following projecting signs in the downtown historic district have been determined by the historic preservation commission to be of special historic significance and traditional character and will be allowed to remain, be repaired, or be replaced in their present size and format: 
(1)  Bradwell Lock and Key sign located at 114 King Street; 
(2)  Dalton Pawnbrokers sign located at 308 South Hamilton Street; 
(3)  Masonic Building sign located at the corner of Crawford and Pentz Street; and 
(4)  Time and temperature sign located at the corner of King Street and Hamilton Street. 
(Ord. No. 09-04, § 1, 4-6-2009) 
Sec. 5.3 - Prohibited signs. 
The following sign types are prohibited in the historic districts: 
5.3-1 Painted signs. Signs painted directly onto retaining walls, fences, roofs, or building facades or walls are prohibited. The following historically significant painted Coca-cola sign on the premises located at 237 S. Hamilton Street is exempt from this provision. 
5.3-2 Freestanding signs. All freestanding signs in the downtown historic district shall comply with subsection 5.2-3. 
(Ord. No. 09-04, § 1, 4-6-2009) 
ARTICLE VI. - NONCONFORMING USES 
Except, as otherwise provided in this ordinance, all signs shall be subject to the provisions below, governing nonconforming uses. Such provisions, however, shall not be construed to prevent a legally operating nonconforming use from using signs otherwise permitted for similar conforming uses. 

Sec. 6.1 - Continuance of nonconforming uses. 
The lawful use of land area or sign structure existing at the time of enactment of or subsequent amendment to this ordinance may be continued subject to the following restrictions even though such use does not conform with the provisions of this ordinance. 
Existing nonconforming sign structures shall not be: 
(a)  Changed to another nonconforming sign; 
(b)  Torn down and rebuilt or moved and rebuilt as a nonconforming sign; 
(c)  Extended or enlarged; or 
(d)  Rebuilt, altered, or repaired after damage exceeding 50 percent of the fair market value of the improvements, except when changed conditions beyond the control of the owner render the sign nonconforming or warrant the sign's repair. 
For the purpose of administration of this provision ordinary maintenance of a sign is not deemed to be or constitute an extension or enlargement of the sign; and changing the face of the sign is not deemed a change prohibited by this section. 
(Ord. No. 09-04, § 1, 4-6-2009) 
Sec. 6.2 - Deterioration. 
Nonconforming signs which have been allowed to deteriorate so as to constitute either an aesthetic nuisance or a safety hazard are subject to removal pursuant to article VIII of this ordinance. A sign shall be deemed to be deteriorated if the paint on its face is faded, cracked or peeling, if removable letters on the changeable copy board are missing or in disarray, if plastic panels are missing, broken or stained, if the sign face or its supporting frame work is rusty or in need of paint, if the area surrounding the sign base is not maintained and kept free of weeds and debris, or if the sign is in need of structural repair. 
(Ord. No. 09-04, § 1, 4-6-2009) 
Sec. 6.3 - Abandonment. 
Nonconforming signs which have been abandoned, shall be removed in their entirety by the record owner of the building or the person who obtained the sign license, whichever owns the sign or portion thereof, within 90 days after the business using the sign closes or ceases to operate on the premises where the sign is located. 
(Ord. No. 09-04, § 1, 4-6-2009) 
Sec. 6.4 - Relocation of existing nonconforming sign. 
Notwithstanding the limitation on existing nonconforming sign structures set out in section 6.1 of this article, the mayor and council are authorized to permit an existing nonconforming sign structure to be relocated and rebuilt upon the same or contiguous parcel if the mayor and council determine that such relocation would: 
(a)  Enhance the aesthetic value, economic value, or future development potential of the effected property; 
(b)  Not increase any dimension of the original existing nonconforming sign structure; 
(c)  Not require any extension to the then-existing lease term, if any, of the nonconforming sign structure; and 
(d)  Not violate applicable zoning restrictions or permitting requirements. 
(Ord. No. 09-23, § 1, 9-7-2009) 
ARTICLE VII. - APPEALS 

Sec. 7.1 - Procedure. 
An applicant whose permit application has been denied or a permittee who alleges that there is error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by the building inspector or any other administrative official in connection with the enforcement of this ordinance, may appeal the decision to the Dalton-Whitfield Board of Zoning Appeals. Any such appeal shall be governed by and in accordance with the procedures set forth in article XIV of the city's zoning ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 09-04, § 1, 4-6-2009; Ord. No. 12-05, § 1, 7-2-2012) 
Sec. 7.2 - Powers. 
The zoning board of appeals shall have the power to reverse or amend the decision of the building inspector, and/or authorize a variance from the strict application of this ordinance where such application will result in practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships to the person owning or having the beneficial use of the property or sign for which the variance is sought. 
(Ord. No. 09-04, § 1, 4-6-2009) 
Sec. 7.3 - Application of the variance power. 
A variance may be allowed by the board of appeals only in cases involving practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships when the evidence in the official record of the appeal supports all the following affirmative findings: 
(1)  That the alleged hardships or practical difficulties or both, are exceptional and peculiar to the property of the person requesting the variance, and result from conditions which do not exist generally throughout the city. 
(2)  That the alleged hardships and practical difficulties, or both, which will result from a failure to grant the variance, include substantially more than mere inconvenience, inability to attain a higher financial return, or both. 
(3)  That allowing the variance will result in substantial justice being done: 
(a)  Considering the public benefits intended to be secured by this ordinance; 
(b)  The individual hardships that will be suffered by a failure of the board to grant a variance; and 
(c)  The rights of others whose property would be affected by the allowance of the variance. 
(4)  That the requested variance is the minimum variance necessary to allow the applicant to enjoy the rights commonly enjoyed by others similarly situated. 
(5)  That granting of the variance would not violate more than one standard of this ordinance. 
The above findings of fact shall be made by the board of appeals, which is not empowered to grant a variance without an affirmative finding of fact on the categories above. Every finding of fact shall be supported in the record of the proceedings of the board. 
Nothing contained herein shall be construed to empower the board of appeals to change the terms of this ordinance or to add to the uses permitted in any district. 
(Ord. No. 09-04, § 1, 4-6-2009) 
ARTICLE VIII. - ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT 

Sec. 8.1 - Sign permit. 
8.1-1 A sign permit is required before a permanent or temporary/special event sign may be erected or attached to, suspended from or supported on a building or structure; and before an existing sign may be enlarged, relocated or materially improved upon to an extent of 60 percent of its total replacement value. All signs using electrical wiring and connections shall require an electrical permit. 
8.1-2 A sign permit shall be issued by the building inspector when the plans, specifications and intended use of the permanent sign or part thereof conform in all respects to the applicable provisions of this ordinance, the city building code, and the requirements of the electrical code as certified by the building inspector and a permit fee has been paid by the applicant. The administrative application shall be accompanied by plans or such other information as the building inspector may reasonably require in the exercise of his duties. In no event shall the building inspector require the applicant to submit the content of the proposed sign as a condition of issuing a permit. Standardized sign plans may be filed with the building inspector in fulfillment of this requirement, although site plans to determine the location of a sign shall be filed with each application. The building inspector shall process the application and either grant or deny the application within 30 business days from the date of receipt of a complete application and payment of the proper fee. The failure of building inspector to timely act on the application shall be deemed a grant of the application. 
8.1-3 [Reserved.] 
8.1-4 Each permit application shall contain an agreement to indemnify and save the city harmless of all damages, demands or expenses, which may in any manner be caused by the sign(s) or sign structure. 
8.1-5 The city shall deny permits to applicants that submit applications for signs that either do not comply with the provisions of this ordinance, are incomplete applications or are applications containing false material statements. Should it be determined that a sign permit was erroneously issued, then such permit is void ab initio. Denial of a permit shall be communicated to the sign applicant in writing by the building inspector before the end of the 30 business days established for review of the application and shall state the reasons for denial of the application. For the purposes of this ordinance, the communication may be made by email or facsimile. Alternatively, the city may serve the sign applicant personally with a copy of the written notice of denial within 30 business days after the city's receipt of the application. The sign applicant shall have the right to appeal the denial of a permit to the city's zoning board of appeals by written notice of appeal as provided in section 7.1 above. 
8.1-6 A sign permit shall become null and void if the sign for which the permit was issued has not been completed within a period of six months after the date of issuance. No refunds will be made for permit fees paid for permits that expired due to failure to erect a permitted sign. Where a permit has expired for failure to erect the sign and a sign is later desired in the same location, a new application must be processed and another fee paid in accordance with the fee schedule in effect at the time of reapplication. 
(Ord. No. 09-04, § 1, 4-6-2009) 
Sec. 8.2 - Permit fee. 
8.2-1 A permit fee shall be paid to the building inspector for each permit required by this ordinance. The fee shall be in accordance to the rate schedule maintained in the office of the building inspector. No permit shall be issued until the exact dimensions and area of the sign have been filed with the building inspector. 
8.2-2 Permit fees shall not apply to the ordinary servicing, repainting of existing sign message, cleaning of a sign, nor to changing of advertising on a sign specifically designed for periodic change of message without change in structure. 
(Ord. No. 09-04, § 1, 4-6-2009) 
Sec. 8.3 - Construction and maintenance. 
All signs, together with all their supports, braces, guys, and anchors, shall be kept in constant repair and unless constructed of galvanized or non-corroding metal, shall be periodically given a protective coating. The area immediately in front of all freestanding signs shall be maintained free of high weeds and debris. In addition to the above provisions, the building inspector may cause any sign or structure which: 
(a)  Is structurally unsafe; or 
(b)  Constitutes a hazard to safety or health by reason of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation or abandonment; or 
(c)  Is not kept in good repair; or 
(d)  Is capable of causing electrical shocks, to be removed following notice of 24-hours to the owner, at the expense of the owner thereof, and to destroy or otherwise dispose of the same. 
(Ord. No. 09-04, § 1, 4-6-2009) 
Sec. 8.4 - Enforcement. 
If any sign is erected or maintained in violation of the provisions of this ordinance, the building inspector shall have the power to give the owner thereof written notice of such violation, said notice to include a brief statement of the particulars in which such violation is to be remedied. If a sign has been registered with the building inspector, notice to the registered owner or the person or firm receiving the permit shall be sufficient. If a sign has not been registered and the owner is not known, affixing a copy of the notice to the sign, graphic structure, or building for a period of ten days shall be sufficient. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the interest of safety, any official or employee of the city shall have the authority to remove and dispose of any sign placed within the public right-of-way without notice to the owner. 
If such a violation is not remedied within 30 days after such notice, the owner shall remove the sign immediately or be subject to a $100.00 a day fine for each day the sign remains. If the sign is not removed by the owner, the building inspector shall have the right to remove such sign at the expense of the owner thereof and to destroy or otherwise dispose of the same. 
(Ord. No. 09-04, § 1, 4-6-2009) 
Sec. 8.5 - New zoning districts. 
If a new zoning district is created after the initial enactment of this ordinance or subsequent amendment, no signs shall be permitted therein until this ordinance shall be amended to include such zone district. 
(Ord. No. 09-04, § 1, 4-6-2009) 
Sec. 8.6 - Delegation. 
The mayor and council are authorized to enter into an intergovernmental agreement with the county to provide for the administration and enforcement of the sign ordinance of the city by the building inspection department of the county. For so long as such intergovernmental agreement is in effect the term "building inspector" as used in the sign ordinance of the city shall mean the building inspector of the county or his designee. At all times, and in any event, the city police department is authorized to enforce the provisions of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 09-31, § 1, 9-21-2009) 
ARTICLE IX. - ADOPTION AND AMENDMENTS 

Sec. 9.1 - Adoption and amendment. 
This ordinance may be adopted or amended hereafter, only after the mayor and council shall have authorized the Dalton-Whitfield County Planning Commission or equivalent (hereafter known as the planning commission) to conduct a public hearing, then review and recommend the adoption or subsequent amendment. After conclusion of the required public hearing (section 9.2), the planning commission shall have 30 days within which to submit its written report to the mayor and council. If the planning commission fails to submit a report within the 30-day period it shall be deemed to have approved the adoption or subsequent amendment.
