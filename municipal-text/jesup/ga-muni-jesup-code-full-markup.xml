PREFACE 
</p>
        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Jesup, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1976 Code, as supplemented through November 1999, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the board of commissioners. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1976 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Senior Code Attorney, and Leesa Hampton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Mike Deal, City Manager, and O'nda Woodard, City Clerk for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

                  (a)  Based on the experiences of other urban counties and municipalities, including, but not limited to, Atlanta, College Park, Carrollton and Whitfield County, Georgia, which experiences are relevant to the problems faced by the city, the board of commissioners takes note of the well known and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable counties in our county. 
                  (b)  Moreover, it is the finding of the board of commissioners that either partial or total public nudity, under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in so-called "nude bars" or establishments offering so-called "nude entertainment" or "adult entertainment" leads to an increase of criminal behavior in the surrounding area and creates undesirable community conditions, blight and diminution in property values. In the same manner, establishments offering photographic adult entertainment have the same deleterious effects on the community. 
                  (c)  Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, live commercial nudity in general and photographic adult entertainment are disorderly conduct, prostitution, solicitation, drug trafficking, drug use and corruption of public officials. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, commercial nudity in general and photographic adult entertainment are depression of property values and acceleration of community blight in the surrounding neighborhood, increased allocation of and expenditure for law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, and increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior described in this subsection. 
                  (d)  Furthermore, it is the finding of the board of commissioners that other forms of adult entertainment including, but not limited to, adult bookstores, peep shows, adult theaters and massage parlors have a deleterious effect upon the quality of life in neighborhoods, commercial districts and urban life in general. 
                  (e)  Accordingly, it is in the best interests of the health, welfare, safety and morals of the community to reduce the adverse impact of adult entertainment facilities by limiting the number of such uses so as to reduce the negative impacts of adult entertainment facilities or adult uses upon other business uses, neighborhood property values, residential areas and public and semipublic uses; to ensure that adult uses and adult entertainment facilities do not impede development, redevelopment and neighborhood revitalization efforts; and to avoid allowing adult entertainment and adult uses in heavily used public pedestrian areas. 
                  (f)  Therefore, the limitation of adult uses and adult entertainment to certain prescribed areas of the city is in the public welfare and it is a matter of governmental interest and concern to minimize the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which provide or establish adult entertainment or adult uses. To that end, this article is hereby adopted.

                  (a)  There is hereby created an animal control board to hold hearings, determine matters and have all power and authority granted to such board in O.C.G.A. § 4-8-20 et seq. (and as such Code section may be amended from time to time), and to also carry out the provisions of this article. The city animal control board shall be composed of seven members. Each commissioner from each commission district will appoint one member, totaling six members, and the mayor will appoint one additional member, to comprise the seven-member board. The appointed members shall be registered voters of the city. Members of the animal control board may include persons who hold elected public office in the City of Jesup, Georgia or Wayne County, Georgia and the animal control officer. Appointments to the animal control board shall be for overlapping terms of three years with terms expiring on December 31. With the exception of those appointments addressed in subsection (b) of this section, the regular initial appointments to the animal control board which first occur after the passage of this section (which such initial appointments shall occur after the expiration of the current terms of the members of the animal control board expire) shall be made so that the terms of said members shall be staggered. In order to establish staggered terms, the initial terms of two members shall be one year, and the initial terms of another two (2) members will be two (2) years, and the initial terms of another three (3) members will be for three years. The members serving the one-year terms, the two-year terms, and the three-year terms shall be determined by agreement of the board of commissioners of the city and mayor or by lot in the absence of such agreement. If at the end of any term of office of a member, a successor thereto shall not have been appointed, then the member whose term of office shall have expired shall continue to hold office until his or her successor shall be so appointed. Any vacancy in the animal control board shall be filled by appointment by the commissioner or mayor who made the original appointment to the animal control board that is then vacant. In the event of the absence or vacancy of the commissioner or mayor who made such original appointment to the animal control board, any such vacancy in the animal control board shall be appointed by an affirmative majority vote of the remaining commissioners and the mayor. Members of the animal control board can serve successive terms without limit. Members of the animal control board shall at all times maintain a current mailing address and telephone number on file with the city. 
                  (b)  Following the passage of this section, the board of commissioners will make any additional appointments to such board necessitated by the increase in the number of the members of such board under this section by a majority vote of the commissioners and mayor. 
                  (c)  The board of commissioners of the city shall be authorized to remove any member for cause after written notice and public hearing. Any one or more of the following shall constitute a reason for removing a member "for cause": 
                  (1)  Participating as a member of the animal control board at any regular or called meeting of the animal control board under the influence of intoxicants, alcohol, or unprescribed or illegal drugs or using, possessing or selling the same in violation of the laws of the State of Georgia; 
                  (2)  Charge and accusation for a misdemeanor which would adversely affect performance of his or her duties as a member of the animal control board;

                  (6)  Filing false expense reports; 
                  (7)  Three consecutive absences from animal control board meetings without obtaining prior approval of a majority of the remaining members of the animal control board; or 
                  (8)  Repeated and continued discourteous treatment of members of the public during animal control board meetings after being admonished concerning such conduct by the board of commissioners of the city. 
                  Charges for "removable for cause" may be made by any city commissioner, any member of the animal control board or by any citizen of the city. Any such charges must be made in writing, dated, signed and delivered to the board of commissioners of the city. A copy of any such charge must be mailed to the person making the charge to the member of the animal control board against whom the charge is directed. Upon receipt of any such charge the board of commissioners of the city will then set a date and time for a public hearing. The city manager will notify both the party making the charge and the member of the animal control board against whom the charges are directed of the date, time and place of the public hearing. The member of the animal control board against whom charges are made shall have at least two weeks' notice prior to the date set for the public hearing to prepare for the public hearing. In the event, after the public hearing, the board of commissioners of the city, by majority vote, removes the member of the animal control board, the board of commissioners of the city will then proceed to fill the vacancy for the unexpired term pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this section.

                  (b)  Exceptions. 
                  (1)  Closing of vacant structures. Whenever the building official finds a building or structure, or portion thereof, to be unsafe, vacant and unfit for human habitation, and is not in danger of structural collapse, the building official shall give the owner, agent or person in control of such building or structure written notice listing the defects, in accordance with established procedures for legal notices, and the building official shall also post a notice on the building or structure. The notice shall require the owner to close the premises within the time specified in the notice. Upon failure of the owner to comply with such notice, the building official shall cause the premises to be closed through any available public agency or by contract with a private entity. The cost thereof shall be charged against the real property upon which the structure is located and a lien filed against such real property. 
                  (2)  Cleaning and securing. All buildings and structures ordered to be closed shall be secured to comply with the Minimum Specifications for Cleaning and Securing Property, as provided by the building official (see exhibit A which is on file in the city clerk's office). 
                  (3)  Imminent danger. In the opinion of the building official, when there is imminent danger of failure or collapse of a building or structure which endangers life, or when any structure, or part thereof, has collapsed and life is endangered by occupancy of the structure, or when there is actual or potential danger to the occupants or those in close proximity of any structure because of explosives, explosive fumes or vapors or the presence of toxic fumes, gases or materials, or operation of defective or dangerous equipment, the building official may order and require the occupants to vacate the premises forthwith. The building official shall give the owner or his agent written notice listing the dangerous condition, in accordance with established procedures for legal notice, and shall place at each entrance to such structure a notice which states: "THIS BUILDING IS UNSAFE AND ITS USE OR OCCUPANCY HAS BEEN PROHIBITED BY THE BUILDING OFFICIAL." Such notice shall remain posted until the structure is secure, the required repairs are made or the hazardous condition removed. It shall be unlawful for any person to remove such notice without written permission of the building official, or for any person to enter the building or structure, except for the purpose of securing the structure, making the required repairs or removing the hazardous condition. 
                  (4)  Emergency safeguards. Whenever the building official determines there is imminent danger to human life, health or safety due to an unsafe condition, the building official may require the necessary work to render the structure safe without notification to the owner or agent as specified in this section. 
                  (5)  Cost of emergency repairs. Costs incurred in the performance of emergency work shall be charged to the owner and shall be collected in the manner provided by law. 
                  (6)  Appeals. The owner, agent or person in control of the building or structure shall have the right to appeal from the decision of the building official, as provided in this article, and to appear before the code enforcement appeals board at a specified time and place to show cause why the owner, agent or person in control of the building or structure should not comply with such notice, except in cases of emergency which involve imminent danger to human life, health or safety.

                  (b)  Refusal to issue. If the application for a permit and the accompanying contract documents describing the work do not conform to the requirements of the technical codes or other pertinent laws or ordinances, the building official shall not issue a permit, but shall return the contract documents to the applicant with his refusal to issue such permit. Such refusal shall be in writing and shall contain the reason for refusal. 
                  (c)  Special foundation permit. When application for permit to erect or enlarge a building has been filed, and pending issuance of such permit, the building official may, at his discretion, issue a special permit for the foundation only. The holder of such permit shall proceed without assurance that the permit for the entire building or structure will be granted. 
                  (d)  Public right-of-way. A permit shall not be given by the building official for the construction or alteration of any building where such building is to be changed and such change will affect the exterior walls, bays, balconies or other appendages or projections encroaching on any street, alley or public lane, except as provided for in chapter 32 of the Standard Building Code.

                  Sec. 22-31. - Statement of findings. 
                  It has been determined by the board of commissioners for the city that it is the practice of certain persons to allow junk automobiles to accumulate in sections of the city, thereby creating a nuisance by reason of the growth of weeds and ponding of water, allowing insects and rodents ideal places to raise, and further creating an unsightly and unhealthy situation.

The fence along the front part of the property and running parallel with the front of the building shall be constructed as set forth in this subsection. In lieu of the materials set forth above in this subsection, the side and rear lines of the junkyard may be a densely planted and maintained buffer strip of the same height as set forth for a fence in this subsection. The fence along the front of the property shall be parallel with the primary building on such property, and in no event closer to the street or roadway than the front wall of such primary building. (Such requirement shall not apply to fences constructed prior to the date of the ordinance from which this section is derived [September 5, 1989] which are otherwise in compliance with all other requirements of this section.) The fence shall be constructed so as to exclude the junkyard from public view, and shall be constructed in a uniform manner and kept neat and in good repair at all times. 
                  (2)  The fence enclosing the junkyard shall not be used for bill postings or other advertising purposes. 
                  (3)  The contents of the junkyard shall not be placed or deposited to a height greater than the height of the fence. 
                  (4)  Each junkyard shall be constructed and maintained so surface water drains freely from the junkyard, and no water shall be allowed to accumulate either on such property or in junk automobiles. 
                  (5)  Weeds shall not be allowed to unreasonably accumulate around junk automobiles. 
                  (6)  All existing junkyards shall be in compliance with this section within a period of 90 days from the date of the passage of the ordinance from which this section is derived [September 5, 1989]; provided, however, if an existing junkyard operator decides to plant a buffer strip around the sides and rear of the junkyard as outlined in subsection (1) of this section, such buffer strip shall be planted within the time stated in subsection (1) of this section, and shall be of such plants that will reach the required height under this section within 365 days from the date of passage of the ordinance from which this section is derived.

                  Editor's note— An ordinance adopted June 19, 2018, repealed art. IX in its entirety and enacted new provisions to read as herein set out. Former art. IX, §§ 22-400—22-418, pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from an ordinance adopted March 4, 2014, § 1. 

                  Sec. 22-400. - Short title. 
                  This article shall be known as the "City of Jesup Pawnshop, Pawnbroker, Secondhand Dealer, Junk Dealer, Junk Collector, Coin Dealer, Gold Buyer, Silver Buyer and Used Precious Metals and Gems Dealer Ordinance." 
                  (Ord. of 6-19-2018(2)) 
                  Sec. 22-401. - Findings and intent. 
                  (a)  This article is adopted to address and promote the interests of public safety, health and welfare of the City of Jesup and its citizens, to aid and assist in the recovery of stolen property, to aid and assist local law enforcement in fulfilling its public safety functions, and to facilitate peaceful, lawful, orderly and efficient pawn brokering, the purchase, sale and consignment of secondhand goods, the purchase and sale of junk or swap items, and the purchase and sale from members of the public of coins, gold, silver, and other used precious metals and gems within the City of Jesup. 
                  (b)  The city recognizes that pawnshops, secondhand dealers, junk dealers, junk collectors, coin dealers, gold buyers, silver buyers, and used precious metals and gems dealers are legitimate businesses authorized by or otherwise permitted under state law. However, the city finds that the services offered by such forms of business may provide an opportunity for individuals to potentially transfer stolen property to those businesses. The city also finds that consumer protection regulation is warranted in transactions involving these businesses. The city further finds that the various purchase, sale, swap, consignment or pawn transactions of pawnshops, secondhand dealers and junk, coin, gold, silver and used precious metals and gems dealers have expanded beyond the city's current ability to effectively or efficiently identify criminal activity related to them. The purpose of the city's regulation of pawnshops, secondhand dealers, junk dealers, junk collectors, coin dealers, gold buyers, silver buyers, and used precious metals and gems dealers is to prevent such forms of business from being used to facilitate the commission of crimes and also to ensure that they comply with basic consumer protection standards, thereby protecting the public health, safety and general welfare of citizens, pursuant to authority granted to the city by state law and the Constitution of the State of Georgia.

Notice of the decision by the city council shall be mailed to the applicant. If the application is denied, such written notification shall set forth in reasonable detail the reasons for the denial and shall notify the applicant of the right to a review. Such review shall be conducted in accordance with section 22-418, hearing procedure, of this article. 
                  (h)  In all instances in which an application is denied, the applicant may not reapply for the same type of license or permit for at least one year from the date of denial. 
                  (i)  Upon the issuance of a license or permit, the licensee or permittee must have and continuously maintain in the city a registered agent upon whom any process, notice, or demand required or permitted by law or authorized under this article may be served.

Upon good cause shown, the city manager may extend such time period only once for an additional time period of three months. Failure to open the licensed or permitted establishment as referred to in this subsection within the six-month period (or within any extended period, if applicable) shall serve as an automatic forfeiture and cancellation of the license or permit, and no refund of license or permit fees shall be made to the licensee or permittee. 
                  (b)  Any holders of a license or permit under this article who shall begin the operation of the business as authorized in the license or permit, but who shall for a period of three consecutive months thereafter cease to operate the business as authorized in the license or permit, shall automatically forfeit the license or permit, which such license or permit shall, by virtue of such failure to operate, be canceled without the necessity for any further action by the city manager or the city council, but shall initially be in the sum and amount of $250.00, subject to change from time to time through resolution by the city council.

                  (b)  No license or permit granted for a pawnshop or to a pawnbroker, secondhand dealer, junk dealer, junk collector, coin dealer, coin buyer, silver buyer or used precious metals and gems dealer shall be transferable except upon application to the office of the city manager in the same form and manner, and subject to the same requirements with respect to the transferee, as are applicable in an original application. Any such license or permit may be transferred only to another applicant doing the same business at the same place as the license or permit holder to whom the license or permit was originally issued. When permission for transfer has been granted, the original licensee, permittee or transferee shall cause the license or permit to be delivered to the city manager, who shall record such transfer, and the transferee shall pay a fee therefore as a condition precedent to engaging in operations under the license or permit. The fee for such transfer shall be $250.00, and does not include the application and administrative fees. Such fees are subject to change from time to time through a resolution of the city council. 
                  (c)  A license or permit renewal may be denied through a showing, pursuant to the hearing procedure outlined in section 22-418 of this article, that such pawnshop, pawnbroker, secondhand dealer, junk dealer, junk collector, coin dealer, coin buyer, silver buyer or used precious metals and gems dealer operator or employee has repeatedly violated sections 22-414, 22-415, or 22-417 of this article or has repeatedly been the subject of investigations involving stolen items.

Such report shall be made immediately upon the receipt of or the presentation of any such item to the pawnshop, pawnbroker, secondhand dealer, junk dealer, junk collector, coin dealer, coin buyer, silver buyer or used precious metals and gems dealer.

                  (c)  With respect to any items which would normally have a serial number or other means of identification, if any pawnshop, pawnbroker, secondhand dealer, junk dealer, junk collector, coin dealer, coin buyer, silver buyer or used precious metals and gems dealer or employee of a pawnshop, pawnbroker, secondhand dealer, junk dealer, junk collector, coin dealer, coin buyer, silver buyer or used precious metals and gems dealer becomes aware that such items have had the identification removed, defaced or destroyed, such fact shall be immediately reported to the municipal police department.

Repetitive acquisition of lost or stolen items for purposes of this sub-paragraph shall be presumed to exist if it is determined that five percent or more of the total of all of a licensee's or permittee's purchase, sale, loan or pawn-related transactions within any consecutive six-month period involved the acquisition of unreported lost or stolen items. 
                  (f)  An affirmative duty is imposed upon every person operating or employed by a pawnshop, pawnbroker, secondhand dealer, junk dealer, junk collector, coin dealer, coin buyer, silver buyer or used precious metals and gems dealer to monitor and report any activity of his, her, or its sellers which appears to unreasonable to the average, prudent person.

                  (h)  If a lost or stolen item is seized or taken into custody from a pawnshop, pawnbroker, secondhand dealer, junk dealer, junk collector, coin dealer, coin buyer, silver buyer or used precious metals and gems dealer by any law enforcement agency, particularly the municipal police, pursuant to an investigation, tip, complaint or police report, the original, lawful owner shall have the ability to reclaim such item through the normal procedures for reclaiming lost or stolen goods applicable to that law enforcement agency and/or through laws of general state-wide application.

In order to establish that an individual was the original, lawful owner of a lost or stolen item, such individual may establish ownership through a showing of an original purchase receipt, invoice, certificate of title, verification, transfer form, warranty agreement, or other purchase document. The original, lawful owner must establish such ownership through a presentation to the municipal police who will determine whether such claim is valid by a preponderance of the evidence. Evidence which should be considered includes: witness testimonials, affidavits of witnesses, photographs, or any other compelling evidence.

                  (1)  Except as provided in section 22-410, renewals and transfers, any change in the ownership of any entity owning a licensed or permitted outlet shall be grounds for the city council to suspend or revoke any license or permit issued under this article. 
                  (2)  A license or permit may be immediately suspended or revoked by the city council upon learning that a licensee or permittee furnished fraudulent, false, misleading, incorrect, or untruthful information in the application for a license or permit, or omits information required in the application for a license or permit, or fails to pay all fees, taxes, or other charges imposed under the provisions of this article. 
                  (3)  The city council may immediately suspend or revoke the license or permit of any licensee or permittee who does not meet the qualifications set forth in this article at any time such information becomes known to the city council.

                  The rules and regulations, ordinances or resolutions adopted pursuant to this article for the purpose of governing land disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices, to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, the practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the state soil and water conservation commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion. 
                  (2)  Cut and fill operations must be kept to a minimum. 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practical erosion potential. 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented. 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practical minimum. 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practical. 
                  (7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development. 
                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control measures shall be installed as soon as practical. 
                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in runoff water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this subsection, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping surface of fills. 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property. 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners.

Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; 
                  (16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the Board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The Director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed. 
                  (17)  Land disturbing activities shall not be conducted within 100 horizontal feet, as measured from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, of the banks of any state waters classified as trout streams pursuant to the state water quality act, O.C.G.A. §§ 12-5-20—12-5-53, unless a variance for such activity is granted by the director, except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit.

                  ARTICLE I. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES 

                  Sec. 46-1. - Authorization. 
                  Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a) have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the board of commissioners of Jesup Georgia, does ordain as follows. 
                  (Ord. of 9-7-2010, § 1(Art. 1, § A)) 
                  Sec. 46-2. - Findings of fact. 
                  (1)  The flood hazard areas of Jesup, Georgia are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (2)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
                  (Ord. of 9-7-2010, § 1(Art. 1, § B)) 
                  Sec. 46-3. - Statement of purpose. 
                  It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
                  (4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and 
                  (5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters. 
                  (Ord. of 9-7-2010, § 1(Art. 1, § C)) 
                  Sec. 46-4. - Objectives. 
                  The objectives of this chapter are: 
                  (1)  To protect human life and health; 
                  (2)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
                  (3)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; 
                  (4)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
                  (5)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
                  (6)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; and 
                  (7)  To insure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

                  ARTICLE IV. - PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

                  Sec. 46-41. - General standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure; 
                  (2)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage; 
                  (3)  New construction or substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
                  (4)  Elevated buildings. All new construction or substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater. 
                  a.  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
                  1.  Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
                  2.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and 
                  3.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both direction. 
                  b.  So as not to violate the "lowest floor" criteria of this chapter, the unfinished or flood resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area, and 
                  c.  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms. 
                  (5)  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
                  (6)  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces. 
                  (7)  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system; 
                  (8)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters; 
                  (9)  Onsite waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding, and; 
                  (10)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure, which is not compliant with the provisions of this chapter, shall be undertaken only if the non-conformity is not furthered, extended or replaced. 
                  (Ord. of 9-7-2010, § 1(Art. 4, § A)) 
                  Sec. 46-42. - Specific standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and/or substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and/or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 46-41(4) of this chapter. 
                  a.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  (2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH zones, may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in subsection 46-33(6) of this chapter. 
                  (3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
                  a.  All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on: 
                  1.  Individual lots or parcels; 
                  2.  In new and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions; 
                  3.  In expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions; or 
                  4.  On a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  b.  Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
                  1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation, or 
                  2.  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
                  c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (Reference subsection 46-41(6) of this chapter) 
                  d.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
                  1.  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days. 
                  2.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions), or 
                  3.  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "new construction", including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsections (3)[a—c] above. 
                  (4)  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 46-12 of this chapter, are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
                  b.  Only if subsection (4)a. of this section is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this article. 
                  (Ord. of 9-7-2010, § 1(Art. 4, § B)) 
                  Sec. 46-43. - Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodway (A-zones). 
                  Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 46-12 of this chapter, where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A-zones), or where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 46-12 of this chapter, then the building inspector shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of this article only if data are not available from these sources, then the following subsections (2) and (3) of this section shall apply: 
                  (2)  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 20 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in more than a one-foot increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.

                  Sec. 46-51. - Variances. 
                  (a)  The appeal board as established by board of commissioners shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this chapter. 
                  (b)  The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the building inspector in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. 
                  (c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the appeal board may appeal such decision to the county superior court, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1. 
                  (d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (g)  In reviewing such requests, the appeal board shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this chapter. 
                  (h)  Conditions for variances: 
                  (1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
                  b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  (2)  The provisions of this chapter are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (4)  The building inspector shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (i)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this chapter, the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

                  Floodproofing means any combination of structural and non-structural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures, which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents. 
                  Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
                  Freeboard means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of floodplain management. "Freeboard" tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed. 
                  Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, adjacent to the proposed foundation of a building. 
                  Historic structure means any structure that is:

                  Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement. An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage, in an area other than a basement, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of other provisions of this code. 
                  Manufactured home means a building, transportable in one or more sections, built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and similar transportable structures placed on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer and intended to be improved property. 
                  Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
                  Mean sea level means the average height of the sea for all stages of the tide. It is used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain.

                  National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) as corrected in 1929 is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
                  *New construction means, for the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced after February 4, 1988 and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced after January 19, 1988 and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
                  *New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed after January 19, 1988. 
                  North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) has replaced the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of [1929 in existing and future FEMA flood modernization maps.]

                  Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (Note: accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance requirements). For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
                  Subdivision. The division of a single lot into two or more lots for the purpose of sale or development. 
                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
                  Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the "start of construction" of the improvement. Note: The market value of the structure should be: 
                  (1)  The appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement; or 
                  (2)  In the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. 
                  This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
                  For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include: 
                  (1)  Those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project; or 
                  (2)  Any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure". 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. 
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  (2)  If the property upon which the lien is perfected should be sold, transferred or conveyed by the owner or parties at interest at any time prior to the termination of the three-year period, then the entire balance due on such lien shall be due and payable to the city; and 
                  (3)  If the amount due on such lien, or any portion thereof, should be unpaid after the passage of the three-year period, or upon the occurrence of the contingency provided for in subsection (f)(2) of this section, the city may enforce the collection of any amount due on such lien for alteration, repair, removal or demolition of buildings, dwellings or structures in the same manner as provided in O.C.G.A. § 48-5-358 and other applicable state statutes.

                  (e)  Acceptable board reaction to applications. 
                  (1)  The board shall approve the application and issue a certificate of appropriateness if it finds that the proposed material changes in the appearance would not have a substantial adverse effect on the aesthetic, historic or architectural significance and value of the historic property or historic district. In making such determination, the board shall consider, in addition to any other pertinent factors, the historical and architectural value and significance, architectural style, general design arrangement, texture and material of the architectural features involved and the relationship thereof to the exterior architectural style and pertinent features of the other structures in the immediate neighborhood. 
                  (2)  The board shall deny a certificate of appropriateness if it finds that the proposed material changes in appearance would have substantial adverse effects on the aesthetic, historic or architectural significance and value of the historic property or historic district.

At least seven days prior to review of a certificate of appropriateness, the board shall take such action as may reasonably be required to inform the owners of any property likely to be affected by reason of the application, and shall give the applicant and such owners an opportunity to be heard and, in cases where the board deems it necessary, it may hold a public hearing concerning the application. 
                  (g)  Interior alterations. In its review of applications for certificates of appropriateness, the board shall not consider interior arrangement or use having no effect on exterior architectural features.

                  (2)  Failure of the board to act on an application within such 45 days shall constitute approval, and no other evidence of approval shall be needed.

                  (1)  If the board rejects an application for a certificate of appropriateness, it shall state its reasons for doing so, and shall transmit a record of such actions and reasons, in writing, to the applicant.

If he so desires, the applicant may make modifications to the plans and may resubmit the application at any time after such board action. 
                  (2)  In cases where the application covers a material change in the appearance of a structure which would require the issuance of a building permit, the rejection of the application for a certificate of appropriateness by the board shall be binding upon the building inspector or other administrative officer charged with issuing building permits and, in such case, no building permit shall be issued. 
                  (k)  Undue hardship. Where, by reason of unusual circumstances, the strict application of any provision of this article would result in the exceptional practical difficulty or undue hardship upon any owner of a specific property, the board, in passing upon such application, shall have the power to vary or modify strict adherence to such provisions, or to interpret the meaning of such provisions so as to relieve such difficulty or hardship, provided, such variances, modifications or interpretations shall remain in harmony with the general purposes and intent of such provisions so that the architectural or historical integrity or character of the property shall be conserved and substantial justice done. In granting variances, the board may impose such reasonable and additional stipulations and conditions as will, in its judgment, best fulfill the purpose of this article. Any undue hardship shall not be a situation of the person's own making. 
                  (l)  Conformance required. 
                  (1)  All work performed pursuant to an issued certificate of appropriateness shall conform to the requirements of such certificate.

                  (o)  Acquisition of property.

                  (p)  Appeals. Any person adversely affected by any determination made by the board relative to the issuance or denial of a certificate of appropriateness may appeal such determination to the appropriate governing body. Any such appeal must be filed with the appropriate governing body (i.e., the county to the Wayne County Commission, the city to the board of commissioners, City of Screven to the Screven City Council and the City of Odum to the Odum City Council) within 15 days of expiration of the 45-day period allowed for board action as set forth in subsection (i)(1) of this section.

Ordinary maintenance or repair of any exterior architectural or environmental feature in or on an historic property to correct deterioration, decay or damage, or to sustain the existing form, and that does not involve a material change in design, material or outer appearance thereof, does not require a certificate of appropriateness. 
                  (b)  Failure to provide ordinary maintenance or repair. Property owners of historic properties or properties within historic districts shall not allow their buildings to deteriorate by failing to provide ordinary maintenance or repair.

                  (2)  If the board determines a failure to provide ordinary maintenance or repair, the board will notify the owner of the property and set forth the steps which need to be taken to remedy the situation. The owner of such property will have 30 days in which to perform such steps. 
                  (3)  If the condition is not remedied within such 30 days, the owner shall be punished as provided in section 54-38 and, at the discretion of the appropriate governing body, the board may perform such maintenance or repair as is necessary to prevent deterioration by neglect. The owner of the property shall be liable for the cost of such maintenance and repair performed by the board. 
                  (c)  Affirmation of existing building and zoning codes. Nothing in this article shall be construed so as to exempt property owners from complying with existing city or county building and zoning codes, nor to prevent any property owner from making any use of his property not prohibited by other statutes, ordinances or regulations.

                  (16)  It shall be the duty and responsibility of the owner or his authorized agent to keep the mobile home park in a reasonably clean and sanitary condition, at all times, subject to approval of the city, and to maintain and keep in good repair all required facilities and accessways. All wastewater from washing machines and other sources shall be discharged into the sanitary sewer system, and under no circumstances shall such wastes be discharged onto the ground, into drainageways or streams. 
                  (17)  Internal water, sewer, street and private drainage systems shall be property of the owner and shall not be dedicated to the city. 
                  (18)  No part of any mobile home park shall be used for nonresidential purposes, except such uses that are approved by the planning commission and board of commissioners, as necessary, for the management and maintenance of the park or the well being of the park residents. 
                  (19)  No mobile home park shall be converted into a mobile home subdivision without a new permit and until all additional requirements for a mobile home subdivision are compiled with.

                  (12)  Such street lighting systems, storm drainage improvements and facilities as are necessary, safe and adequate for the mobile home subdivision, as determined by the city, shall be installed by the developer. Where a mobile home subdivision is traversed by any existing or proposed watercourse, drainageway, channel or stream there shall be provided a stormwater easement or drainage right-of-way of at least ten feet along each side of the channel or watercourse for the purpose of widening, deepening, relocating, improving, maintaining or protecting such drainage easement. 
                  (13)  A landscaped buffer strip shall be located adjacent to each exterior property line of the mobile home subdivision. The width of such required buffer strip shall vary according to the screening contained within the buffer strip. If landscaped plantings only are used, the buffer strip shall be at least 50 feet wide and contain visually solid landscaped screening at least six feet high, approved by the city. If visually solid earth mounds or berms are used, then they shall be at least six feet in height and landscaped, and the required width of the buffer strip shall be reduced to a minimum of 25 feet. Such buffer strip shall be dedicated as a permanent easement and deed restriction, but shall remain in the ownership of the adjacent property owners for their limited use, enjoyment and maintenance, with further provision that no permanent structures of any type may ever be erected within the buffer strip. The portions of a lot within a buffer strip shall not be utilized when determining whether total lot size meets minimum requirements of this article. The remainder of a lot, excluding the buffer strip, shall at least meet the minimum lot size requirements under this article, but in no instance shall it be less than the equivalent square footage of the average of adjacent subdivision lots without the buffer strip. 
                  (14)  Entrances to mobile home subdivisions shall be landscaped and signed in a harmonious and visually attractive manner. 
                  (15)  No provisions of this article shall be construed to relieve the developer of meeting additional provisions or requirements required of all subdivisions under the subdivision regulations (appendix B to this Code) of the city. 
                  (16)  No part of any mobile home subdivision shall be used for nonresidential purposes, except such uses that are approved by the planning commission and board of commissioners, as necessary, for the management and maintenance of the subdivision or the well being of the mobile home park residents. 
                  (c)  Individual lots. 
                  (1)  Mobile homes may not be used on individually owned lots for residential purposes, other than on lots within an approved mobile home subdivision. 
                  (2)  No temporary permits for mobile homes in residential zones shall be allowed, except in the case of a natural disaster or other act of God where a single-family residence was destroyed for a period not to exceed 90 days. Such temporary permit shall expire and may not be renewed unless a building permit for reconstruction of the single-family residence is issued within the 90-day period. Upon issuance of a building permit, the temporary permit may be extended for the length of construction or a period not to exceed six months, whichever is less. 
                  (3)  A mobile home may be used for office or security space, on a temporary basis, for the length of construction only, upon city permit, in nonresidential zones, upon a lot for which a building permit for permanent construction has been issued.

                  Sec. 70-2. - Zoning hearings. 
                  (a)  Zoning hearings before the board of commissioners shall be public hearings and all discussions and deliberations shall be conducted in open meeting provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall prohibit the city council from going into executive session for the purpose of discussing legal questions arising due to the matter under consideration with the city attorney in an attorney-client relationship. 
                  (b)  At the commencement of the hearing, the presiding officer, whether the mayor or the mayor pro tem, or someone designated by the presiding officer, shall give a brief explanation of the matter under consideration and the issue or issues to be determined. 
                  (c)  Following such explanation, the petitioner and proponents of the petition seeking a change in zoning, or the proponents of any other proposed amendment to the zoning ordinance, as the case may be, shall be afforded the first opportunity to present their case and evidence to the board of commissioners. 
                  (d)  After this presentment, all parties in opposition shall be afforded an opportunity to present their opposition and evidence.

Once deliberation begins by the city council on the issue before it, no further evidence may be presented or arguments made either for or against the proposed rezoning or other amendments to this ordinance being considered. 
                  (h)  Since one of the functions of the planning and zoning commission is to consider and plan for the long-range development of the city, the board of commissioners shall give great weight to the recommendations of the planning and zoning commission.

                  (5)  If the local government has an adopted land use plan, whether the zoning proposal is in conformity with the policy and intent of the land use plan; and

However, failure to mail such notice shall not invalidate the public hearing or rezoning process. 
                  (c)  The notice shall state the general nature of the proposed amendment and shall include the location of the property, the present zoning classification of the property, and the proposed zoning classification of the property.

                  (d)  For the purposes of this section, the existence of a street or alley between two pieces of property shall not prevent them from being considered as adjoining.

The appointed members shall be registered voters of the city. No member of the planning and zoning commission shall be persons who hold elected public office in the city or Wayne County, Georgia. Appointments to the planning and zoning commission shall be for overlapping terms of three years with terms expiring on December 31. The mayor's initial appointment to this planning and zoning commission may occur following the passage of this section and will be effective for the remaining term and duration of existing appointments already made by the board of commissioners. Thereafter, the regular initial appointments to the planning and zoning commission which first occur after the passage of this section (and including the mayor's regular initial appointment that will also be available at that time) shall be made so that the terms of said members shall be staggered. In order to establish staggered terms, the initial terms of two members shall be one year, and the initial terms of another two members will be two years, and the initial terms of another three members will be for three years. The members serving the one-year terms, the two-year terms, and the three-year terms shall be determined by agreement of the board of commissioners of the city and the mayor or by lot in the absence of such agreement. If at the end of any term of office of a member, a successor thereto shall not have been appointed, then the member whose term of office shall have expired shall continue to hold office until his or her successor shall be so appointed. Any vacancy in the planning and zoning commission shall be filled by appointment by the commissioner or mayor who made the original appointment to the planning and zoning commission that is then vacant. In the event of the vacancy of the commissioner or mayor who made such original appointment to the planning and zoning commission, any such vacancy in the planning and zoning commission shall be appointed by an affirmative majority vote of the remaining commissioners and the mayor. Members of the planning and zoning commission can serve successive terms without limit. The members of the planning and zoning commission shall receive no compensation for their services, and shall at all times maintain a current mailing address and telephone number on file with the city. 
                  (b)  The board of commissioners of the city shall be authorized to remove any member for cause after written notice and public hearing. Any one or more of the following shall constitute a reason for removing a member "for cause": 
                  (1)  Participating as a member of the planning and zoning commission at any regular or called meeting of the planning and zoning commission under the influence of intoxicants, alcohol, or unprescribed or illegal drugs or using, possessing or selling the same in violation of the laws of the State of Georgia; 
                  (2)  Charge and accusation for a misdemeanor which would adversely affect performance of his or her duties as a member of the planning and zoning commission; 
                  (3)  Conduct unbecoming of a member of the planning and zoning commission, including, but not limited to, demeaning conduct or use of profanity or vulgar language during any open public meeting of the planning and zoning commission; 
                  (4)  Indictment of a felony; 
                  (5)  Unauthorized use of city property, city telephones or other city communication equipment; 
                  (6)  Filing false expense reports; 
                  (7)  Three consecutive absences from planning and zoning commission meetings without obtaining prior approval of a majority of the remaining members of the planning and zoning commission; or 
                  (8)  Repeated and continued discourteous treatment of members of the public during planning and zoning commission meetings after being admonished concerning such conduct by the board of commissioners of the city. 
                  Charges for "removable for cause" may be made by any city commissioner, any member of the planning and zoning commission or by any citizen of the city. Any such charges must be made in writing, dated, signed and delivered to the board of commissioners of the city. A copy of any such charge must be mailed to the member of the planning and zoning commission against whom the charge is directed. Upon receipt of any such charge the board of commissioners of the city will then set a date and time for a public hearing. The city manager will notify both the party making the charge and the member of the planning and zoning commission against whom the charges are directed of the date, time and place of the public hearing. The member of the planning and zoning commission against whom charges are made shall have at least two weeks' notice prior to the date set for the public hearing to prepare for the public hearing. In the event, after the public hearing, the board of commissioners of the city, by majority vote, removes the member of the planning and zoning commission, the board of commissioners of the city will then proceed to fill the vacancy for the unexpired term pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this section.

                  (a)  The city tree board shall be composed of seven members. Each commissioner from each commission district will appoint one member, totaling six members, and the mayor will appoint one additional member, to comprise the seven-member board. The appointed members shall be registered voters of the city. No member of the tree board shall be persons who hold elected public office in the city or Wayne County, Georgia. Appointments to the tree board shall be for overlapping terms of three years with terms expiring on December 31. With the exception of those appointments addressed in subsection (b) of this section, the regular initial appointments to the tree board which first occur after the passage of this section (which such initial appointments shall occur after the expiration of the current terms of the members of the tree board expire) shall be made so that the terms of said members shall be staggered. In order to establish staggered terms, the initial terms of two members shall be one year, and the initial terms of another two members will be two years, and the initial terms of another three members will be for three years. The members serving the one-year terms, the two-year terms, and the three-year terms shall be determined by agreement of the board of commissioners of the city and mayor or by lot in the absence of such agreement. If at the end of any term of office of a member, a successor thereto shall not have been appointed, then the member whose term of office shall have expired shall continue to hold office until his or her successor shall be so appointed. Any vacancy in the tree board shall be filled by appointment by the commissioner or mayor who made the original appointment to the tree board that is then vacant. In the event of the absence or vacancy of the commissioner or mayor who made such original appointment to the tree board, any such vacancy in the tree board shall be appointed by an affirmative majority vote of the remaining commissioners and the mayor. Members of the tree board can serve successive terms without limit. The members of the tree board shall receive no compensation for their services, and shall at all times maintain a current mailing address and telephone number on file with the city. 
                  (b)  Following the passage of this section, the board of commissioners will make any additional appointments to such board necessitated by the increase in the number of the members of such board under this section by a majority vote of the commissioners and mayor. 
                  (c)  The board of commissioners of the city shall be authorized to remove any member for cause after written notice and public hearing. Any one or more of the following shall constitute a reason for removing a member "for cause": 
                  (1)  Participating as a member of the tree board at any regular or called meeting of the tree board under the influence of intoxicants, alcohol, or unprescribed or illegal drugs or using, possessing or selling the same in violation of the laws of the State of Georgia; 
                  (2)  Charge and accusation for a misdemeanor which would adversely affect performance of his or her duties as a member of the tree board; 
                  (3)  Conduct unbecoming of a member of the tree board, including, but not limited to, demeaning conduct or use of profanity or vulgar language during any open public meeting of the tree board; 
                  (4)  Indictment of a felony; 
                  (5)  Unauthorized use of city property, city telephones or other city communication equipment; 
                  (6)  Filing false expense reports; 
                  (7)  Three consecutive absences from tree board meetings without obtaining prior approval of a majority of the remaining members of the tree board; or 
                  (8)  Repeated and continued discourteous treatment of members of the public during tree board meetings after being admonished concerning such conduct by the board of commissioners of the city. 
                  Charges for "removable for cause" may be made by any city commissioner, any member of the tree board or by any citizen of the city. Any such charges must be made in writing, dated, signed and delivered to the board of commissioners of the city. A copy of any such charge must be mailed to the person making the charge to the member of the tree board against whom the charge is directed. Upon receipt of any such charge the board of commissioners of the city will then set a date and time for a public hearing. The city manager will notify both the party making the charge and the member of the tree board against whom the charges are directed of the date, time and place of the public hearing. The member of the tree board against whom charges are made shall have at least two weeks notice prior to the date set for the public hearing to prepare for the public hearing. In the event, after the public hearing, the board of commissioners of the city, by majority vote, removes the member of the tree board, the board of commissioners of the city will then proceed to fill the vacancy for the unexpired term pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this section. 
                  (d)  Ex officio members shall be: (1) one member of the board of commissioners of the city as selected by the mayor, (2) the city employee responsible for planting, maintenance and removal of trees, shrubs and vines on city property (presently the superintendent of streets and sanitation or his or her representative), and (3) the Wayne County, Georgia Forester. 
                  (e)  During the first month after being appointed after the passage of this section, and at the first meeting after July 1 of each year, the tree board shall elect: (1) a chairman, (2) a vice-chairman and (3) a secretary-treasurer from among its appointed members. 
                  (f)  The tree board shall meet at least once during each quarter of the year during January, April, July and October. Additional meetings may be held as requested by the chairman. A quorum shall consist of three appointed members. If the chairman or vice-chairman is not present, the members present, by majority vote, shall designate one of the members to serve as acting chairman for that meeting. 
                  (g)  During June of each year, the tree board shall submit a report on its activities during the past year to the board of commissioners of the city.

                  Any building, structure or use of land existing at the time of the enactment of this ordinance or any amendment thereto that does not conform to the requirements of the district in which it is located may be continued and maintained subject to the following provisions. They shall not be: 
                  61.1 Changed to another nonconforming use. 
                  61.2 Enlarged or extended except in conformity with this ordinance. 
                  61.3 Reestablished after discontinuance for one year. 
                  61.4 However, a nonconforming building which has been damaged or destroyed by fire, explosion, accident or calamity (as contrasted to deterioration due to time or neglect) may be reconstructed and used for the same nonconforming use, provided that: (1) The reconstructed building shall not exceed in height, area and volume the building destroyed; (2) Building reconstruction shall be started one year from date the building was destroyed and shall be carried on without interruption. 
                  61.5 Nevertheless, the erection of a single-family dwelling shall be permitted on any lot of record which contains an area or width less than that required for a single-family dwelling in the district in which such lot is located. Such lot must be in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership on the effective date of this ordinance. Nothing herein shall be construed to require any change in the overall plans, construction, or designated use of any development, structure, or part thereof, where official approval and required building permits were granted before the enactment of this ordinance. 
                  Section 62. - Off-street automobile parking and storage. 
                  Off-street automobile parking or storage space shall be provided on every lot on which any of the following uses are hereafter established in all districts except the C-1 central business district; or provided that where no parking space can reasonably be provided on the same lot, such space shall be provided on any lot a substantial portion of which is within 400 feet of such uses. No certificate of occupancy will be issued upon completion of any building or group of buildings unless and until all off-street parking and loading requirements, shown upon the plans or made part of the building permit shall be in place and ready for use. The required parking space for any number of separate uses may be combined in one lot. However, when separate uses served by one lot include a church, theater, an assembly hall, whose peak attendance will be at night or Sunday, one-half of the required parking space for such use may be allocated to the other separate uses for computation of the total parking space requirement. Each automobile parking space shall be not less than 200 square feet in area, exclusive of adequate access drives and maneuvering space, and only those areas exclusively designed and designated as parking spaces, and the immediate access thereto, may be counted, and in no case shall areas that are inaccessible because of size, topography or utilization for purposes other than parking, be considered in the calculation of square footage for parking. Such space shall be provided with vehicular access to a street or alley; such use shall not thereafter be encroached upon or altered and shall be equal in number to at least the minimum requirements for the specific use set forth as follows:
