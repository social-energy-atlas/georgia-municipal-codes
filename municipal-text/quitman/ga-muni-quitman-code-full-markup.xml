         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACEThis Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Quitman, Georgia.
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1962 Code, the 1986 Code, and ordinances adopted through November 3, 2005, by the Board of
Commissioners. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section
is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any
section of the 1962 Code and the 1986 Code, and any subsequent ordinance included herein.
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage.
Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their
location within the Code is included at the back of this Code.
Chapter and Section Numbering System
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts
separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the
second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new
sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically
come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way
or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the
subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care
should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters.
Page Numbering System
6/2/2019 Quitman, GA Code of Ordinances
2/196
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume.
The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the
number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical
parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology,
others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the
indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested.
Looseleaf Supplements
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-todate. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies
of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages.
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility
of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted
immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.
Acknowledgments
This publication was under the direct supervision of Jim Jenkins, Code Attorney, and Ricardo Lewis, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida.
Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project.
The publisher is most grateful to Janice Jarvis, City Clerk-Treasurer, for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that
her efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the City of Quitman, Georgia, readily accessible to all
citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

                  (1) Editor's note— Printed herein is the Charter of the city, as adopted by 1962 Ga. Laws (Act No. 829), page 2894. Amendments are indicated by parenthetical history
                  notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original. Obvious misspellings and
                  punctuation errors have been corrected without notation. The style used for headings and catchlines has been made uniform, and the same system of capitalization and
                  expression of numbers in text as appears in the Code of Ordinances has been used. Additions made for clarity such as consistent state statute citations and catchline
                  modifications are indicated by brackets.

                  Editor's note—
                  Section 8, which prescribed the procedure in case of a tie vote in commission elections, was repealed by 1970 Ga. Laws (Act No. 1011), page 2655, § 1. This information
                  now appears in section 32 of the Charter.
                  Sec. 9. - Oath [of] commissioners.
                  On or before the first day of January of each year the commissioner or commissioners elected shall be notified of their election and shall appear before a judge or clerk of
                  some court of record or before some justice of the peace and take and subscribe the following oath or affirmation: "I swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully and impartially
                  demean myself as a member of the Board of Commissioners for the City of Quitman during my continuance in office and in all things pertaining to my office. I will be
                  governed by what in my judgment is for the public good and the best interest of the City of Quitman, so help me God."

                  (b)
                  Each member of the board of commissioners shall be reimbursed for expenses actually and necessarily incurred in their capacity as a commissioner of the Board of

                  (c)
                  This section shall become effective upon the taking of office of those elected to the next regular municipal election following the date of the adoption of this section.

                  record all its actions. All votes shall be taken by "aye" and "no" and shall appear on the minutes. It shall be required to meet at such times and as often in extra meetings as
                  any two of them or the chairman may designate or call.
                  Sec. 12. - Appointment of chairman.
                  [The provision under this section has been omitted at the discretion of the city as superseded by 1987 Ga. Laws (Act No. 437), page 5230, § 1, which amended section 6 in
                  its entirety and replaced it with a new section 6.]
                  Sec. 13. - Chairman pro tem.
                  The chairman of the board of commissioners shall appoint one of the commissioners chairman pro tem, who shall exercise the routine duties of the chairman in case of the

                  It shall be unlawful for any member of the board of commissioners to be interested either directly or indirectly, in any contract having for its object the improvement of the
                  city or any part thereof, or providing for the expenditure of its money. Any violation of this section by any member of the board of commissioners shall, on conviction
                  thereof, be punished as for misdemeanors under the Georgia Code.
                  Sec. 16. - Quorum, vote required.

                  (b)
                  Codify all ordinances, rules or regulations, and to adopt said codification by ordinance. A copy of said codification, when duly certified as being a true copy by the city

                  contest is for an office. If the result of any election in which any question is submitted is contested, then said ordinary [Probate Judge] shall also cause notice to be served
                  on the chairman of the board of commissioners and published one time in any newspaper published in the city. Said ordinary [Probate Judge] shall fix the time of hearing
                  said contest, which shall not be later than ten days after service has been effected, provided that both parties shall have five days' notice before the hearing. The contestor
                  shall pay the sheriff, or his deputy, the statutory fee for service of process in advance for service and notice of contest. The contest shall be held at the courthouse. Said

                  appear at the time fixed for trial, the bond may be forfeited by the recorder [judge] and an execution issued thereon by serving the defendant, if found, and his sureties,
                  with a rule nisi at least five days before the hearing of the said rule nisi.
                  Sec. 39. - Appeals from police court [municipal court].
                  Any person convicted by the police court [municipal court] may enter an appeal from the judgment of said court to the board of commissioners; provided the appeal shall

                  the final judgment rendered in the case; and provided further, nothing in this section shall prevent the defendant who desires to appeal his case to the board of
                  commissioners, or to certiorari the same the superior court, to file the usual pauper affidavit in lieu of giving of the bond and security and any of the costs in the above; and
                  provided, further, the applicant failing to give the bond and security may, in the discretion of the recorder [judge], be placed in the city prison or county jail to await the
                  final judgment on the appeal abovementioned. Certiorari shall be governed by the same rules that govern other certioraris, except as above specified.

                  said notice in which to appear before the city tax assessors and make objections to the determination by the assessors of said values so fixed by them, and have the right to
                  present such evidence and argument as they may desire in support of said objections. The city tax assessors shall hear said objections and such evidence and argument, if
                  any, before finally determining the value of said real estate and personal property. If any taxpayer shall be dissatisfied with the final determination of said tax assessors, he

                  chosen shall hear the objecting taxpayer and the city tax assessors upon said objection and shall determine the value of said real estate or personal property for taxation and
                  the value so determined by them shall be final and conclusive upon the city and the taxpayer. In the event the taxpayer shall not make objection to the final assessment as

                  Code or any ordinance shall be punished by a fine not to exceed $1,000.00, imprisonment in the city or county jail, not to exceed six months, and to work upon the streets
                  or other public places as the board of commissioners or chief of police may designate, not to exceed six months. Any one or more of these punishments may be inflicted by
                  the court in its discretion and the fine imposed may be collected by execution.
                  (c)
                  Except as otherwise provided by law or ordinance:
                  (1)
                  With respect to violations of this Code that are continuous with respect to time, each day that the violation continues is a separate offense.
                  (2)
                  With respect to other violations, each act constitutes a separate offense.
                  (d)
                  The imposition of a penalty does not prevent suspension or revocation of a license, permit or franchise or other administrative sanctions.
                  (e)
                  Violations of this Code that are continuous with respect to time are a public nuisance and may be abated by injunctive or other equitable relief. The imposition of a penalty
                  does not prevent injunctive relief.

                  Upon approval of the minutes of a meeting of the board of commissioners, the city clerk shall enter upon such minutes the date of the reading, if any, and approval of the
                  same, and such entry shall be signed by the clerk and by the chairperson or chairperson pro tem of the board.

                  Sec. 2-28. - Rules of order.
                  The following rules of order shall govern the conduct of meetings of the board of commissioners:
                  (1)
                  Every question of order shall be decided by the chair without debate, and the chair may call for the sense of the board on any question of order.
                  (2)
                  Each member of the board, when about to speak, shall respectfully address the chair, and no person shall speak more than twice on the same subject matter unless by
                  unanimous consent of the board or to make an explanation.
                  (3)
                  Whenever the chairperson shall desire to address the board on the merits of any question before it, or to vacate the chair for any temporary purpose, he or she shall call
                  upon some other member to fill his or her place during such vacation.
                  (4)
                  On an amendment being moved, a member who has spoken on the main question may speak again on the amendment.
                  (5)
                  When a question has been moved and been put by the chair in the affirmative and negative, it becomes a full question and cannot be debated afterwards unless under
                  motion of reconsideration.
                  (6)
                  No motion for adjournment can be made by a member when another is speaking.
                  (7)
                  When a question is under debate, no motion shall be received but to adjourn, to lie on the table, for the previous question, to postpone to a day certain, to amend or to
                  postpone indefinitely, which several motions shall have precedence in the order they stand arranged and the motion for adjournment shall always be in order and be
                  decided without debate except as provided in subsection (6) of this section.
                  (8)
                  6/2/2019 Quitman, GA Code of Ordinances
                  21/196
                  Any matter or question will be tabled at the request of any member.
                  (9)
                  When a proper motion is made, but information is wanted, the proper motion is to postpone to a day certain.
                  (10)
                  When a matter is claiming present attention, but it is desired to reserve it for a more suitable occasion, the order is to "lie on the table." It may then be called for at any
                  time.
                  (11)
                  The question is to be put first on the affirmative and then on the negative.
                  (12)
                  When any question before the board is decided by vote, the yeas and nays shall be recorded.
                  (13)
                  When a question has been made and carried in the affirmative or negative, it shall be in order for any member of the majority to move for the reconsideration thereof, but
                  no motion for the reconsideration of any vote shall be in order after a bill, resolution, amendment or motion upon which the vote was taken has gone out of the possession
                  of the board.
                  (14)
                  The consequences of a measure may be reprobated in strong terms, but to question the motives of those who propose to advocate it is a personal attack and out of order.
                  (15)
                  All reports, petitions and resolutions must be submitted to the board in writing.
                  (16)
                  Except as otherwise provided in this section or elsewhere in this Code, meetings of the board shall be governed by Robert's Rules of Order.

                  No commissioner shall be allowed to vote on any claim against the city which he or she presents or proffers in his or her own name, or in which he or she may be directly
                  or indirectly interested. Where the private interests of a commissioner are concerned in a bill or question, he or she shall withdraw, and when such interest has appeared,
                  his or her vote shall be disallowed, even after a decision.

                  (a)
                  When an ordinance or addition to or amendment of an ordinance is submitted to the board, it shall be read once at the meeting when offered, or twice, should the board, by
                  unanimous consent, suspend the rules for that purpose. It shall then lie over to the next regular meeting, at which, if two readings were heard at the meeting when it was
                  submitted, the board may take final action thereon, but no ordinance or addition, alteration or amendment thereof shall be passed until it has been read three times.
                  (b)
                  Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, if all members of the board are present and give unanimous consent thereto, any ordinance or addition to
                  or amendment of an ordinance may be read three times at such meeting and the board may take final action thereon, either passing or rejecting the same. Also, by
                  unanimous consent of all members of the board, an ordinance or addition to or amendment of an ordinance may be so read and passed at a called or special meeting of the
                  board at which all members are present.
                  (c)
                  Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) and (b) of this section, should a member of the board of commissioners be unable to perform his or her duties for 30
                  consecutive days, performance of duties being unable to attend any regular or called meeting of the board of commissioners due to illness, either mental or physical, and a
                  certification by the commissioner's attending physician or a written notarized statement by the commissioner who is unable to perform his or her duties is presented to the
                  city clerk and placed in the official minutes of the city attesting to the fact of the disability and that the disability shall continue for an additional period of time not yet
                  determined, then, by a unanimous vote of the remaining four members of the board of commissioners, the rules may be waived at a special or called meeting, and an
                  ordinance be read three times and adopted. Further, should a member of the board of commissioners be unable to attend a regularly scheduled or called meeting, then a
                  written statement to the effect that the absent member wishes to vote affirmatively to waive the rules to allow a particular ordinance to be read three times at said meeting
                  shall be deemed acceptable to allow the rules to be waived if all other commissioners vote to waive the rules. This will allow the reading of an ordinance three times and
                  its adoption at a regular or called meeting.

                  of the board. He or she shall keep another such book, to be known as the resolution book, in which he or she shall record, in the order in which they are passed, all

                  it bears in the ordinance or resolution book, such description being given as "Ordinance (or Resolution) No. (giving the number thereof)."

                  or resolution and its number, and the ordinance or resolution has been entered in the appropriate book and the entry has been signed as provided in section 2-32, it shall be

                  from which this section derives, such license holder divests himself or herself of 50 percent or more of the interest in the business owned by him or her at the time of the

                  (b)
                  Visibility; shrubbery. On any premises occupied by a license holder hereunder, the immediate proximity of the building shall be maintained so as to keep vegetation low
                  and vision unobstructed. Failure to comply with this provision shall be grounds for suspension or revocation of consumption-on-premises licenses, or denial of renewal of
                  such licenses.
                  (c)
                  Permitted areas for consumption on premises. The consumption of alcoholic beverages shall be permitted only inside that portion of the licensee's building designated for
                  such consumption, or at such outside location immediately adjacent to the building and specifically designated for the consumption of food and alcoholic beverages, but

                  34/196
                  not for the consumption of alcoholic beverages only, with such outside location for the consumption of food and alcoholic beverages to include patios, decks, screen
                  porches and like areas. This provision is not to be interpreted as permitting unrestricted consumption of alcoholic beverages on any portion of licensed premises, especially
                  including parking lots and the grounds surrounding the building and similar areas, and no licensee hereunder shall permit the consumption of alcoholic beverages except in
                  those designated areas as described in this section.
                  (d)
                  Premises to be well-lighted. The exterior of each building in which alcoholic beverages are sold for consumption on the premises shall have sufficient lighting so that all
                  entrances and parking areas are clearly visible at all times when the premises are open for business. Also, the lounge and restaurant areas, if any, and all tables, booths and
                  other areas where customers are served, and all passageways for customers shall be sufficiently well illuminated so that they may be viewed by those in such areas.
                  (e)
                  Fire and safety; maximum occupancy provisions. All drinking establishments licenses, or to be considered for licensing for consumption on the premises of any alcoholic
                  beverages, shall be measured as to the net usable floor area, and publicly visible posters stating the maximum number of persons allowable inside the building where such

                  Sec. 20-1. - Findings of fact.
                  (a)
                  The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
                  governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health,
                  safety and general welfare.
                  (b)
                  Flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas
                  by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damage.

                  Sec. 20-2. - Purpose of chapter.
                  It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas
                  by provisions designed to:
                  (1)
                  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood
                  heights or velocities.
                  (2)
                  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction.
                  (3)
                  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.
                  (4)
                  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage.
                  (5)
                  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.

                  floodway map and the water surface elevation of the base flood.
                  Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively
                  increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot.
                  Floor means any floor (including basement) usable for living purposes, which include working, sleeping, eating, cooking or recreation, or a combination thereof.
                  Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
                  Mangrove stand means an assemblage of mangrove trees which is mostly low trees noted for a copious development of interlacing adventitious roots above the ground and

                  Mean sea level means the average height of the sea for all stages of the tide. It is used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain. For purposes
                  of this chapter, the term is synonymous with National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD).
                  Mobile home means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent
                  foundation, when connected to the required utilities. It does not include recreational vehicles or travel trailers.
                  National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD), as corrected in 1929, is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain.
                  New construction means structures for which the start of construction commenced on or after February 2, 1982.
                  New mobile home park or mobile home subdivision means a parcel or contiguous parcels of land divided into two or more mobile home lots for rent or sale for which the
                  construction of facilities for servicing the lot on which the mobile home is to be affixed, including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, either final site grading or the
                  pouring of concrete pads and the construction of streets, was completed on or after February 2, 1982.
                  Start of construction means the first placement of permanent construction of a structure, other than a mobile home, on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings or any
                  work beyond the stage of excavation, including the relocation of a structure. Permanent construction does not include the installation of streets or walkways; nor does it
                  include excavation for a basement, footing, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory
                  buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not a part of the main structure. For a structure, other than a mobile home, without a basement or
                  poured footings, the "start of construction" includes the first permanent framing or assembly of the structure or any part thereof on its piling or foundation. For mobile
                  homes not within a mobile home park or mobile home subdivision, the term "start of construction" means the affixing of the mobile home to its permanent site. For mobile
                  homes within mobile home parks or mobile home subdivisions, the term "start of construction" is the date on which the construction of facilities for servicing the site on
                  which the mobile home is to be affixed, including, at a minimum, the construction of streets, either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads and installation of
                  utilities, is completed.
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, as well as a mobile home.
                  Substantial improvement means any repair, reconstruction or improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the
                  structure, either before the improvement or repair is started or if the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred. For the purposes of this
                  definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences, whether
                  or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however, include any project for improvement of a structure to comply with
                  existing state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications, which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions, or any alteration of a structure listed on the
                  National Register of Historic Places or a state inventory of historic places.
                  Variance means a grant of relief to a person from the requirements of this chapter, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter, where
                  specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship.
                  (b)
                  Unless specifically defined in subsection (a) of this section, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common
                  usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.

                  (2)
                  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
                  (3)
                  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense, create a
                  nuisance, cause fraud on, or victimization of, the public or conflict with existing ordinances of the city.
                  (g)
                  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted under this section shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation to
                  which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.

                  (a)
                  Issuing of certificate of appropriateness. For all buildings in a designated historic area or designated historic properties which rate exceptional, notable or valuable, the
                  commission shall recommend the application to the city commission to issue a certificate of appropriateness if it finds that the proposed material change in appearance will
                  not have a substantial adverse affect on the aesthetic, historic or architectural significance and value of the historic property or the historic district. In making this
                  recommendation, the commission shall consider, in addition to all other pertinent factors, the historic and architectural value and significance, architectural style, general
                  design, arrangement, texture, and material of the architectural features involved, and the relationship thereof to the exterior architectural style and pertinent features of

                  components and/or the exterior by an foreseeable force, including but not limited to, weather, fire and termites. The commission is authorized to make recommendations to
                  the board of commissioners to:
                  (1)
                  Require that a certificate of appropriateness be obtained prior to any material change in appearance of the designated property; and
                  (2)
                  Require that the property or district be shown on the official zoning map of the city.
                  (c)
                  Required public hearings. The commission and the city shall hold a public hearing on any proposed ordinance for the designation of any historic district or property.

                  by the commission to all owners and occupants of such properties. All such notices shall be published or mailed no less than ten days nor more than 20 days prior to the
                  date set for the public hearing. A notice sent by United States mail to the last known owner of the property shown on the city and county tax rolls and notice sent via
                  United States mail to the address of the property to the attention of the occupant shall constitute legal notification to the owner and occupant under this chapter.

                  Recommendations of proposed designations. A recommendation to affirm, modify or withdraw the proposed ordinance for designation shall be made by the commission

                  proposed, may adopt the ordinance with any amendments it deems necessary, or reject the ordinance.
                  (f)
                  Notification of historic preservation division. No less than 30 days prior to making a recommendation on any ordinance designating a property or district as historic, the
                  commission must submit a report as required by law to the historic preservation division of the department of natural resources.
                  (g)
                  Notification of adoption of ordinance for designation. Within 30 days following the adoption of the ordinance for designation by the city commission, the owners and
                  occupants of each designated historic property and designated historic district shall be given written notification of such designation by the city commission, which notice
                  shall apply to said owners and occupants of the necessity of obtaining a certificate of appropriateness prior to undertaking any material change in appearance of historic
                  property designated or within the historic district designated. A notice sent via the United States mail to the last known owner of the property shown on the city and/or
                  county tax roll or a notice sent via United States mail to the address of the request that a property owner make repairs necessary to prevent permanent damage to the
                  structure shall constitute legal notification to the owner under this chapter. After notice and hearing, the commission may require such owner to make repairs pursuant to
                  this subsection, including but not limited to the following:
                  (1)
                  Exterior painting;

                  (h)
                  Failure to comply. Failure to comply with the order of the board of commissioners to execute repairs shall be a violation of this Code and be punished up to the maximum
                  penalty allowed by the Charter of the city. Each day that repairs, which have been ordered, remain undone shall constitute a separate offense.

                  of a new business. The tax registration herein provided for shall be issued by the city clerk and if any person, firm, or corporation whose duty it is to obtain a registration
                  shall, after said registration or occupation tax becomes delinquent, transact or offer to transact, in the city, any of the kind of profession, trade, or calling subject to this
                  chapter without having first obtained said registration, such offender shall, upon conviction by the city judge, be punished according to the general penalties described in

                  designee of the city upon the property of the defendant located in said jurisdiction, and sufficient property shall be advertised and sold to pay the amount of said execution,

                  defendant in said execution shall have rights of defense, by affidavit of illegality and otherwise which are provided by the applicable laws in regard to tax executions.
                  When a nulla bona entry has been entered by proper authority upon an execution issued by the city clerk against any person defaulting on the occupation tax, the person
                  against whom the entry was made shall not be allowed or entitled to have or collect any fees or charges whatsoever for services rendered after the entry of the nulla bona.
                  If, at any time after the entry of nulla bona has been made, the person against whom the execution issues pays the tax in full, together with all interest and costs accrued on
                  the tax, the person may collect any fees and charges due him or her as though he or she had never defaulted in the payment of the taxes.

                  any activities conducted by a church, civic group, school, whether kindergarten, elementary, or secondary, including but not limited to any club or organization associated
                  with such school, plus any other type of organization or group which is recognized by the United States Internal Revenue Service as a charitable or nonprofit organization
                  to raise money for a purpose set out in subsection (b) of this section.
                  (b)
                  Classification. Fundraising activities are classified as any event whereby money is collected by an organization described in subsection (a) of this section for charitable
                  purposes or for the funding of educational projects, religious use, public use, including but not limited to raising funds for any governmental organization or department of

                  permit applications shall be signed by the individual in charge of the fundraising activity and shall include the individual's name and address. Upon the receipt and
                  approval by the city manager of the permit application, the same shall be signed by the city manager and issued through the clerk/treasurer's office. In the event the city
                  manager is unavailable to sign the permit, the clerk/treasurer is authorized to issue a permit on behalf of the city under this section.
                  (1)
                  In the event the city manager, or the clerk/treasurer in the absence of the city manager, determines that the application does not meet the requirements of this section for
                  the issuance of a fundraising permit, the application shall be denied and the reasons for denial shall be furnished in writing to the applicant.
                  (2)
                  Upon the denial by the city manager or clerk/treasurer of an application for a fundraising permit, the applicant shall have the right to request that the decision of the city
                  manager or clerk/treasurer be reviewed by the board of commissioners at its next regularly scheduled meeting.
                  (3)
                  In the event a fundraising permit is denied, the applicant shall have the right to purchase the appropriate city business license and to proceed with the event should all other
                  requirements of this Code be complied with.
                  (d)
                  Limitation of number of permits. No applicant shall be granted more than four fundraising permits in any calendar year. In the event the applicant is a club or other subunit
                  or organization under the direction and control of the school system, the four permits per calendar year shall apply to that specific club, organization or subunit and not the

                  (e)
                  Special conditions. The city manager shall have the authority to impose special conditions upon the issuance of a fundraising permit, should in his or her opinion such
                  conditions be necessary for the protection of the general public and their well-being. Special conditions may include but are not limited to the following:
                  (1)
                  The requirement that a security guard be present.
                  (2)

                  (3)
                  Limitation of the hours that the activity may be conducted or restrictions as to the location and number of signs advertising the fundraising activity.
                  All special restrictions shall be shown upon the face of the fundraising permit issued, and the same shall be available at the site of the activity for inspection by the police
                  department at all times that the fundraising activity is being conducted. Failure to comply with the special conditions of a fundraising permit will be grounds for the denial
                  of future permits and shall constitute a violation of this section on behalf of the person executing the permit application.
                  (f)
                  Food sales. Any fundraising application involving the sale of on-site prepared food must include an approved permit from the county health department and must comply
                  with any and all regulations of the health department.
                  (g)
                  Exemption on grounds that business is operated for charitable purpose. No business on which a business registration or occupation tax is levied by this chapter shall be
                  exempt from said registration or tax on the ground that such business is operated for a charitable purpose, unless 100 percent of the entire proceeds from said business are
                  devoted to such purpose. An affidavit shall be required from the principal officer of the business to the city attesting to the fact that the business is a 100 percent charitable
                  organization. The city may require additional affidavits or proof at its discretion. Additionally, the city cannot levy any occupation tax, regulatory fee, or administrative fee
                  on any state or local authority, or nonprofit organization. Proof of nonprofit status may be required.

                  shall conform to the minimum requirements as set forth in this chapter and this subsection. For single-family residence construction covered by the provisions of this
                  subsection, there shall be a buffer zone between the residence and any state waters classified as trout streams pursuant to article 2 of chapter 5 of the Georgia Water
                  Quality Control Act (O.C.G.A. § 12-5-20 et seq.). In any such buffer zone, no land disturbing activity shall be constructed between the residence and the point where
                  vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action from the banks of the trout waters. For primary trout waters, the buffer zone shall be at least 50
                  horizontal feet, and no variance to a smaller buffer shall be granted. For secondary trout waters, the buffer zone shall be at least 50 horizontal feet, but the director may
                  grant variances to no less than 25 feet. Regardless of whether a trout stream is primary or secondary, for first order trout waters, which are streams into which no other
                  streams flow except for springs, the buffer shall be at least 25 horizontal feet, and no variance to a smaller buffer shall be granted. The minimum requirements of this
                  chapter and the buffer zones provided by this section shall be enforced by the local issuing authority;
                  (5)

                  (8)
                  Any project involving less than one acre of disturbed area; provided, however, that this exemption shall not apply to any land disturbing activity within a larger common
                  plan of development or sale with a planned disturbance of equal to or greater than one acre or within 200 feet of the bank of any state waters, and for purposes of this
                  subsection, the term "state waters" excludes channels and drainageways which have water in them only during and immediately after rainfall events and intermittent
                  streams which do not have water in them yearround; provided, however, that any person responsible for a project which involves less than one acre, which involves land
                  disturbing activity, and which is within 200 feet of any such excluded channel or drainageway, must prevent sediment from moving beyond the boundaries of the property
                  on which such project is located; and provided, further, that nothing contained herein shall prevent the local issuing authority from regulating any such project which is not
                  specifically exempted by subsections (1) through (6), this subsection and subsections (9) and (10) of this section;
                  (9)

                  (Code 1986, § 21-3; Ord. No. 416, § 3, 1-20-1993; Ord. No. 528, § III, 11-3-2005)
                  Sec. 46-4. - Minimum requirements for erosion and sedimentation control using best management practices.
                  (a)
                  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land disturbing activities. Therefore, plans for those land disturbing activities,
                  which are not exempted by this chapter, shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion and sedimentation control measures and practices. The provisions shall be
                  incorporated into the erosion and sedimentation control plans. Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements
                  of this section. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other
                  temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion and sedimentation pollution during all stages of any land disturbing
                  activity.
                  (b)
                  Minimum requirements/bmps.
                  (1)
                  Best management practices as set forth in this section shall be required for all land disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management
                  practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with subsection (2) of this subsection or any
                  substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act. As used
                  in this subsection, the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the Manual for
                  Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia, specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b).
                  (2)
                  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a
                  separate violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f),
                  the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric
                  turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the
                  receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This subsection shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the
                  construction of single-family homes, which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale, unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or
                  greater than five acres.
                  (3)
                  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of
                  any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, for each day on which such failure occurs.
                  (4)
                  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which
                  discharges from land disturbing activities occur.
                  (c)
                  Rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted. The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to this chapter for the purpose of
                  governing land disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including
                  sound conservative and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those
                  practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the state Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the
                  year in which the land disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following:
                  (1)
                  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion;
                  (2)
                  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum;
                  (3)
                  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type as to create the lowest practical erosion potential;
                  (4)
                  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented;
                  (5)
                  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum;
                  (6)
                  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable;
                  (7)
                  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development;
                  (8)
                  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable;

                  105/196
                  (9)
                  To the extent necessary, sediment in runoff water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is
                  stabilized. As used in this subsection, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1
                  et seq.;
                  (10)
                  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills;
                  (11)
                  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property;
                  (12)
                  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners;
                  (13)
                  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are
                  kept to a minimum;
                  (14)
                  Land disturbing activity plans for erosion and sedimentation control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate
                  sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in this chapter;
                  (15)
                  Except as provided in subsection (16) of this section, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point
                  where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural
                  resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, or where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must
                  be constructed; provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; provided, however, the
                  buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of article 5, chapter 5 of title 12, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act (O.C.G.A. § 12-5-20 et seq.), shall remain
                  in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this subsection. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer:
                  a.
                  No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on
                  the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative
                  cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the streambed; provided, however, that any
                  person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim
                  vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient
                  quantity to keep shade on the streambed; and
                  b.
                  The buffer shall not apply to the following land disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of
                  perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the
                  project plans and specifications and are implemented:
                  1.
                  Stream crossings for water lines; or
                  2.
                  Stream crossings for sewer lines.
                  (16)
                  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of
                  any state waters classified as trout streams pursuant to article 2 of chapter 5 of title 12, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act (O.C.G.A. § 12-5-20 et seq.), except where a
                  roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of
                  25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general
                  variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement
                  for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are
                  incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer:
                  a.
                  No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on
                  the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative
                  cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the streambed; provided, however, that any
                  person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim
                  vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient
                  quantity to keep shade on the streambed; and
                  b.
                  The buffer shall not apply to the following land disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of
                  perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the
                  project plans and specifications and are implemented:

                  Stream crossings for sewer lines.
                  (d)
                  Severability. Nothing contained in this chapter shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions, which contain
                  stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in this chapter.
                  (e)
                  Liability. The fact that land disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a
                  presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this chapter or the terms of the permit.
                  (Code 1986, § 21-4; Ord. No. 416, § 4, 1-20-1993; Ord. No. 528, § IV, 11-3-2005)
                  Sec. 46-5. - Application or permit process.
                  (a)
                  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall review the general development plans and detailed plans of the local issuing authority
                  that affect the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall review the zoning, stormwater management, subdivision, flood damage prevention chapters,
                  this chapter, and other ordinances which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the operator is the
                  only party who may obtain a permit.
                  (b)
                  Application requirements.
                  (1)
                  No person shall conduct any land disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the city without first obtaining a permit from the state department of natural
                  resources, environmental protection division, to perform such activity.
                  (2)
                  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the state department of natural resources, environmental protection division, and must include the applicant's erosion and
                  sedimentation control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in this chapter. Soil erosion and sedimentation
                  control plans shall conform to the provisions of this chapter. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by three copies of the applicant's soil
                  erosion and sedimentation control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation
                  of the plan or that such a visit was not required in accordance with rules and regulations established by the board.
                  (3)
                  A fee shall be charged for each acre or fraction thereof in the project area. The amount of the fee shall be established by ordinance or resolution of the board of
                  commissioners, from time to time, and made available for public examination in the office of the city clerk.
                  (4)
                  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 2-5-23(a)(5); provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land
                  disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land disturbing activity
                  included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that
                  is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a), half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division, except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to
                  give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) and (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction.
                  (5)
                  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or
                  disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion and sedimentation control plan. A district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of a
                  district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No
                  permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by this article and bonding, if required, have been obtained. Such review
                  will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and
                  approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district.
                  (6)
                  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act (O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.), as amended,
                  within three years prior to the date of filing of the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application.
                  (7)
                  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination
                  thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply
                  with this chapter or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the
                  proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an
                  ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit
                  violations.

                  Sec. 46-6. - Inspection and enforcement.
                  (a)
                  The state department of natural resources, environmental protection division, will periodically inspect the sites of land disturbing activities for which permits have been
                  issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and
                  sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate both primary and secondary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary
                  permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land disturbing activities.
                  Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land disturbing
                  activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit
                  conditions, or with the provisions of this chapter, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve
                  compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land disturbing activity fails to comply within the time
                  specified, he or she shall be deemed in violation of this chapter.
                  (b)
                  The state department of natural resources, environmental protection division, shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to
                  carry out duties as prescribed in this chapter, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and
                  inspecting the sites of land disturbing activities.
                  (c)
                  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry
                  for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the
                  process of carrying out his or her official duties.

                  (a)
                  Failure to obtain a permit for land disturbing activity. If any person commences any land disturbing activity requiring a land disturbing permit as prescribed in this chapter
                  without first obtaining said permit, the person shall be subject to revocation of his or her business license, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a business
                  and associated work activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority.
                  (b)
                  Stop work order.
                  (1)
                  For the first and second violations of the provisions of this chapter, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall
                  have five days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within five days, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a stop work order requiring
                  that land disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided; however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat
                  to public health or waters of the state or if the land disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the director or the local issuing authority
                  shall issue an immediate stop work order in lieu of a warning;
                  (2)
                  For a third and each subsequent violation, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop work order;
                  (3)
                  All stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred;
                  (4)
                  When a violation in the form of taking action without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer, or significant amounts of sediment, as determined by the local issuing
                  authority or by the director or his or her designee, have been or are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not been properly
                  designed, installed, and maintained, a stop work order shall be issued by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee. All such stop work orders shall
                  be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop work orders shall apply to all land
                  disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls.
                  (c)
                  Bond forfeiture. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land disturbing activities has failed to comply with the approved plan, a written notice to
                  comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which such
                  measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he or she shall be deemed in violation of this
                  chapter and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to have forfeited his or her performance bond, if required to post one under the provisions of this chapter. The
                  issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land disturbing activity and
                  bring it into compliance.
                  (d)
                  Monetary penalties. Any person who violates any provisions of this chapter, or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant to this chapter, or who negligently
                  or intentionally fails or refuses to comply with any final or emergency order of the director issued as provided in this chapter shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed
                  $2,500.00 per day. For the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this chapter, notwithstanding any provisions in any city charter to the contrary, municipal courts shall be
                  authorized to impose a penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Notwithstanding any limitation of law as to penalties which can be assessed for violations of
                  county ordinances, any magistrate court or any other court of competent jurisdiction trying cases brought as violations of this chapter under county ordinances approved
                  under this chapter shall be authorized to impose penalties for such violations not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Each day during which a violation or failure or
                  refusal to comply continues shall be a separate violation.
                  (Code 1986, § 21-7; Ord. No. 416, § 7, 1-20-1993; Ord. No. 528, § VII, 11-3-2005)

                  (a)
                  Administrative remedies. The suspension, revocation, modification or grant with condition of a permit by the local issuing authority upon finding that the holder is not in
                  compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan; or that the holder is in violation of permit conditions; or that the holder is in violation of any
                  ordinance; shall entitle the person submitting the plan or holding the permit to a hearing before the county board of zoning appeals within 60 days of written notice of
                  appeal.
                  (b)
                  Judicial review. Any person aggrieved by a decision or order of the local issuing authority, after exhausting his or her administrative remedies, shall have the right to
                  appeal de novo to the superior court of the county.
                  (Code 1986, § 21-8; Ord. No. 416, § 8, 1-20-1993; Ord. No. 528, § IX, 11-3-2005)

                  110/196
                  Neither the approval of a plan under the provisions of this chapter, nor the compliance with provisions of this chapter shall relieve any person from the responsibility for
                  damage to any person or property otherwise imposed by law nor impose any liability upon the local issuing authority or district for damage to any person or property.
                  (b)
                  The fact that a land disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a
                  presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this chapter or the terms of the permit.
                  (c)
                  No provision of this chapter shall permit any persons to violate the Georgia Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act or the rules
                  and regulations promulgated and approved thereunder or pollute any waters of the state as defined thereby.

                  (a)
                  The board of commissioners, on its own motion or upon the written request of any citizen or entity owning property abutting any strip of land in the city that is narrow or
                  irregularly shaped and/or so small as to be incapable of being used independently as zoned or under applicable subdivision or other developmental ordinances, or as
                  streets, may offer to sell the property to abutting property owners without the necessity of conducting an auction or requesting sealed bids after advertisement under the
                  following terms and conditions:
                  (1)
                  Upon its own motion, or upon the request of any property owner whose property abuts a tract of city-owned property, the board of commissioners may conduct a
                  preliminary investigation of any city property, reviewing information on the property, recommendations of the city manager, city utilities superintendent and any other city
                  personnel or other interested parties. After an investigation, the board of commissioners shall make a finding as to the potential use of the property and its value to the city.
                  (2)
                  If the board of commissioners determines that the property is of a size and shape that is incapable of being used independently as zoned, or as a street (whether city owns
                  the property, in fee simple, or the same is used by easement) and that the property is of no significant value to the city because of its size, shape and location, then the
                  board of commissioners may declare that it is not practical to use the property as a tract and that it has no significant value or use to the city.
                  (3)
                  Upon a determination by the board of commissioners that the property cannot be used as a tract and is of no significant value to the city, the board of commissioners shall
                  consider and determine at a public hearing at which it will consider any comments of any interested parties and the city personnel, and any other evidence which may be
                  pertinent to the question, and shall make a determination as to whether the disposal of the property to the abutting landowners would facilitate the highest and best use of
                  the abutting owner's property. If the board of commissioners makes an affirmative determination of this question, the board of commissioners may approve the property to
                  be sold under subsection (b) of this section. This hearing shall be within 40 days of the motion by the board or the receipt of the written request from an adjoining property
                  owner.
                  (b)
                  In the event that the sale of property under this section has been approved in accordance with subsection (a) of this section, the board of commissioners shall notify each
                  abutting property owner by certified mail or by personal service by the police department of the availability of the property by purchase from the city.
                  (1)
                  This notification shall give the owners a minimum of ten days' notice and a maximum of 30 days' notice of the time and place of the meeting of the board of
                  commissioners to conduct a sale of the property. At the meeting, all interested abutting property owners shall be given the opportunity to bid upon the property. At the
                  meeting of the board of commissioners, the board shall have the option to agree to sell to the highest bidder or to reject all bids and retain the property for use by the city.
                  The city shall have the right to retain an easement over any property that it decides to sell under this section or to sell less than fee simple title should the board of
                  commissioners determine that the same is in the best interest of the city.
                  (2)
                  In the event the board of commissioners accepts the highest bidder or bidders for the property, the purchaser or purchasers shall be responsible for furnishing the city with
                  a current survey of the property prepared by a state-registered surveyor; and the city shall, upon the payment of the agreed purchase price, furnish the purchaser with a
                  quitclaim deed to the property in question. The city shall be under no obligation to transfer any property until the receipt of the aforementioned survey and full purchase
                  price. The survey shall be delivered to the city a minimum of five days prior to closing. Closing shall be within 60 days of the date of the meeting in which the city agrees
                  to sell said property. A 25 percent deposit shall be due and payable upon the acceptance of the bid, which shall be forfeited by the purchasers in the event the closing does
                  not take place within 60 days and the time has not been extended by the city unless the failure to close is the fault of the city. All payments shall be made by cashier's
                  check, cash, certified check, or money order.
                  (3)
                  In the event a citizen brings a request to the board of commissioners under this section, the request shall be accompanied by an administrative fee to handle the
                  administrative costs of the city's investigating the property to make the determinations required in accordance with this section. The amount of the administrative fee shall
                  be established by ordinance or resolution of the board of commissioners, from time to time, and made available for public examination in the office of the city clerk. In the
                  event the city commission on its own motion institutes a determination proceeding, no administrative handling fee shall be assessed on any party.

                  customers shall be initially categorized as seasonal gas users. The rate for seasonal gas users shall be established by ordinance or resolution of the city commission, from
                  time to time, and made available for public examination in the office of the city clerk.

                  Yearround residential gas users, city rate B.
                  a.
                  Yearround residential gas users are those residential customers which have appliances which consume or use natural gas yearround in a significant amount. In order to
                  qualify as a yearround user, the customer shall request that the city inspect and verify that the customer has appliances or other gas-using devices in the home such as
                  would result in a continual consumption of gas for the entire year. The consumption of gas by the leaving of a pilot light burning or the fact that a barbecue grill is attached
                  to city gas will not constitute a use such as would entitle the customer to rate B charges. The rate for yearround residential users shall be established by ordinance or
                  resolution of the city commission, from time to time, and made available for public examination in the office of the city clerk.
                  b.
                  Should a customer be dissatisfied with the determination by city personnel after inspection the customer's home, the customer shall be entitled to appeal the determination
                  to the utility hearing board. Upon an appeal to the utility hearing board, the customer shall be allowed to present evidence to show that he or she is qualified to a rate B
                  charge and the city shall be allowed to present evidence substantiating the cities initial determination that rate A, not rate B, should be applied to the customer's account.
                  The burden of proof shall be upon the customer.

                  Pretreatment of wastes. Persons discharging industrial wastes into the sewerage system may be required to pretreat such wastes. Plans for all pretreatment facilities shall
                  be approved by the city manager and the state environmental protection division prior to construction. At the time written plans are submitted for approval, written
                  maintenance plans shall also be submitted and approved by the city manager. The facilities shall be allowed to operate only as long as they are maintained in accordance
                  with the approved maintenance plans. Pretreatment requirements shall be determined on a case-by-case basis and shall include the following facilities as a minimum:
                  (1)
                  Neutralization. If plans are submitted for the neutralization of strong acid or alkaline wastes, the plans shall include the necessary instrumentation and controls to assure
                  compliance with the above regulations at all times.
                  (2)
                  Equalization. Holding tanks or equalization basins shall be required ahead of the receiving manhole of the city's sewerage system when deemed necessary by the city
                  manager to prevent peak flows that exceed the capacity of the system or that result in operational problems.
                  (3)
                  All pretreatment facilities shall be operated and maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operation by the owner at his or her expense.
                  (l)
                  Waiver of requirements. There shall be no provision for the granting of variances for discharge of incompatible wastes. If a user begins to violate any of the provisions of
                  this section, it shall be his or her responsibility to apply to the city manager who can issue a temporary permit along with a compliance schedule for planning and
                  construction of necessary treatment or pretreatment works. Each case will be carefully evaluated with respect to its effect on the wastewater treatment system and the
                  environment prior to issuance of a temporary permit and compliance schedule. Any dilution of the wastewater by the user for the purpose of decreasing the concentrations
                  of toxic materials shall be considered as a violation of this division.
                  (m)
                  Discontinuance of service for failure to comply. Failure to comply with the provisions of this section shall be cause for the discontinuance of sewer or water service to the
                  offending person. The procedure shall be as follows: A written notice, signed by the city manager, shall be delivered personally to the person then responsible for the
                  offending use, outlining the conditions of the wastes which violate the city's ordinances. In the event that the person in charge will not accept the notice, it shall be
                  conveyed by registered mail to the responsible person. The person notified shall have 24 hours from the time of receipt of the notice, either personally delivered or
                  received by registered mail, to correct the offending conditions. If correction is not made or a request for extension is not received by the city within 24 hours, it shall be
                  mandatory that water or sewer service shall be discontinued to the offending person without further notice. If a request for an extension of time is received by the city
                  within 24 hours of the above notice and if circumstances are such that, in the opinion of the city manager, the best interest of the city would be served by extending the
                  time for correction of the offending condition, then he or she may grant an extension of time up to a maximum limit of 30 days.
                  (n)
                  Responsibilities of the person discharging waste. It shall be the responsibility of the company, corporation, or person discharging industrial waste into the city's sewerage
                  system to:
                  (1)
                  Build a control structure in the discharge line from his or her premises, immediately prior to the entrance of the discharge line into the city's sewerage system, suitable for
                  the sampling and measuring of wastes. Plans for this structure must be approved by the city. This requirement must be waived if deemed unnecessary by the city. In the
                  event that no special manhole is required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the
                  building sewer is connected.
                  (2)
                  Contact the city manager prior to operation changes which will materially alter the characteristics of the waste from the last prior sampling.
                  (3)
                  Make timely, periodic payments to the city of surcharges for excessive loadings as detailed in the city's user charge system.

                  The city shall not be required to provide sewer service to adjacent unincorporated areas. The city may provide a point of connection to the city's sewerage system provided
                  the developer constructs the necessary sewer lines and appurtenances, at his or her expense, and the city's sewerage system is capable of accepting and treating the

                  132/196
                  additional flow. The city may elect to accept the newly constructed sewer lines and appurtenances, provided the materials and construction meet design and regulatory
                  requirements.

                  observation, measurement, sampling, and testing pertinent to discharge to the public sewerage system in accordance with the provisions of this division.
                  (b)
                  While performing the necessary work on private properties referred to herein, the authorized employees or agents of the city shall observe all safety rules applicable to the
                  premises established by the company, and the company shall be held harmless for injury or death to the employees, and the city shall indemnify the company against loss
                  or damage to its property by said employees or agents and against liability claims and demands for personal injury or property damage asserted against the company, to
                  maintain safe conditions as required by this division.

                  The provisions of this division shall not be deemed as alleviating compliance with applicable state and federal regulations. Specific user charges and industrial cost
                  recovery requirements, promulgated pursuant to title II of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 (Public Law 92-500, 33 USC 1281 et seq.), shall
                  be considered as a part of this division upon official adoption. All nonresidential users will be required to comply with pretreatment standards as outlined in title 40 of the
                  Code of Federal Regulations, part 403.

                  (a)
                  Violations of this division shall be a misdemeanor punishable under the laws of the state. Each day of continuing violation shall be considered a separate offense. Any
                  person violating any of the provisions of this division shall become liable to the city by reason of violation.
                  (b)
                  In the event of a violation of this division, the health officer or authorized employees may verbally instruct the owner as to the necessary corrective action. If the owner
                  fails to carry out verbal instructions in a timely manner or if a serious violation or hazard to public health exists, the health officer or city may issue to the owner a written
                  order stating the nature of the violation, the corrective action, and the time limit for completing the corrective action. The record of the mailing of said notice or order shall
                  be prima facie evidence thereof and failure of said owner or owners to receive the same shall in no way affect the validity of any proceedings conducted pursuant to this
                  division.
                  (c)
                  Failure to comply with any written order duly issued by the health officer or the city pursuant to this division will constitute a separate misdemeanor and upon conviction
                  thereof shall be punished as provided by the laws of the state; provided, further, that compliance with this division is required, notwithstanding the fact that a written order
                  might have been issued.
                  (d)
                  The violation of any provisions of this division, as now existing or as may be hereafter amended, may be enjoined by instituting appropriate proceedings for injunction in
                  the courts of competent jurisdiction in this state. Any public nuisance which is injurious to the public health, safety, or comfort may be abated by instituting appropriate
                  proceedings for injunction in the court of competent jurisdiction in this state. Such actions may be maintained notwithstanding that other adequate remedies at law exist.
                  Such actions may be instituted in the name of the city.
                  (e)
                  Upon the receipt of a notice of a violation of this division and/or an order of the city requiring an act or thing to be done or to cease, the owner or owners of any premises
                  then in question may, in writing, demand a hearing before the city to present the evidence challenging the validity of the city's order. The owner may appear in person, by
                  agent, or by attorney. Said demand must be filed with the clerk of the city and be made within five days from the receipt of the order being challenged. Upon receipt of a
                  demand for a hearing, the city will set a date, time, and place for said hearing to be not less than 21 days from the date of the filing of said demand. The hearing as
                  provided herein shall apply to any customer's complaint, dispute, or challenge of the city's rules, regulations, resolutions, ordinances, or policies. Upon a customer's
                  written complaint filed with the clerk, the city shall set a hearing as provided herein or at a time agreed upon by the parties.
                  (f)
                  Evidence before the city of any hearing conducted pursuant to subsection 56-255(e) of this section shall be admitted in accordance with the rules of evidence of the
                  superior courts of the state; provided, however, the city may take official notice of any order, rule, regulation, or any other document, record, or entry contained in its
                  official record or minutes for evidentiary purposes.
                  (g)
                  For the purposes of this division, the decisions of the city will prevail in any instances in which there is a conflict between it and the health officer on any issue of
                  sanitation, or the lack of it, and its effect on human health or well-being.

                  A.
                  6/2/2019 Quitman, GA Code of Ordinances
                  149/196

                  4-1. Preliminary plat.
                  4-1.1. Purpose: The purpose of the preliminary plat is to safeguard the subdivider from unnecessary loss of time and expense in preparation of a subdivision plat which
                  does not conform with the specifications of the subdivision ordinance. The preliminary plat requires only approximate accuracy of scale and dimension. Public agencies
                  having jurisdiction will review preliminary plats regarding matters within their jurisdiction. During the review process, the subdivider or his agent may be called upon for
                  consultation.
                  4-1.2. Subdivisions Requiring No New Street, Water, or Sewer Facilities: All subdivisions which do not involve the platting, construction, or opening of new streets, water
                  or sewer facilities may be accepted by the City of Quitman Zoning Administrator in the form of a final plat, provided that essential data required by the reviewing agencies
                  to ensure compliance with the intent of this ordinance is submitted.
                  4-1.3. Filing: Any person desiring to subdivide land shall file with the City of Quitman Zoning Administrator five copies of the preliminary plat accompanied by a letter of
                  application. The letter of application shall contain the name and address of the developer(s) and his agent(s), the zoning of the property to be subdivided, whether or not
                  the subdivision will be developed in phases, plans for potential annexation, and plans for serving the proposed subdivision with sewer and water facilities. The plat shall
                  be prepared in accordance with this ordinance and with applicable city specifications by a registered land surveyor, who is licensed under the laws of the State of Georgia.
                  The preliminary plat shall be deemed filed with the planning commission when it is filed with the City of Quitman Zoning Administrator. At the time of filing, a certificate
                  of filing shall be provided to the subdivider and shall include the time and date of filing. The zoning administrator shall have authority to reject the preliminary plat if it
                  does not comply with this ordinance. If rejected, the zoning administrator shall provide the subdivider with a written statement specifying all the respects in which the plat
                  fails to comply. Filing of the preliminary plat shall be accomplished at least 20 days prior to the regular planning commission meeting at which it is to be considered. The
                  preliminary plat shall include:
                  a. Title block and north arrow: The plat will show the name of the proposed subdivision, its location, the name, address and registration number of the surveyor preparing
                  the plat and the date of the plat. A north arrow shall be included with a notation referencing the bearings to magnetic north, astronomical north or grid north.
                  b. General layout: The plat shall show information as to the proposed street layout and widths, layout of lots with a notation as to the minimum size and width of lots and
                  any proposed open space. Any lands to be dedicated will be clearly identified. Plat scale, total acreage of the site and total number of lots created shall also be indicated.
                  Lot and block identification and building setback lines shall also be indicated.
                  c. Topography: The plat shall show existing contour lines dashed and any proposed contour lines solid (unless waived by the city engineer), both set of lines to be at twofoot intervals, mean sea level (M.S.L.). Prominent drainage features such as lakes, depressions, streams, etc., which could affect the design of the subdivision shall be
                  shown. Engineering data showing the high water elevation and how it was established shall be submitted with the plat.
                  d. Existing features: The plat shall show the locations and names of existing and platted property lines, streets (and its right-of-way), railroads (and its right-of-way),
                  public and private rights-of-way, sanitary sewer (and size), water mains (and size), bridges, culverts, storm drainage (and size), easements, parks and other public open
                  spaces, land lot and land district lines, city limits lines and names of adjoining property owners or subdivisions. Groups of trees and swamp areas shall also be indicated.
                  e. Location map: The plat shall include a small-scale map of sufficient clarity so that the location of the proposed subdivision can be readily determined.
                  f. Water and sewer: A statement from the subdivider shall be submitted with the preliminary plat which will describe the method by which sanitary sewer and water
                  facilities will be provided. If non-public sewer is proposed to serve a subdivision, then soils will be identified according to local Soil Conservation Service soil maps (see
                  section 2-20) and soils percolation test results and contour map shall accompany the preliminary plat at the time of submission. The contour map shall show location and
                  identification of each soil class and site of each percolation test. Percolation tests shall be made in accordance with county health department requirements.
                  g. Future tract plan: In cases where a subdivision is to be developed in stages with additional plats being filed with the planning commission at a later date(s), the filing of
                  the initial plat will be accompanied by a future tract plan, a reasonably accurate plat in sketch form of the entire tract which will show the future street system and
                  topography for the entire tract. Once the required tract plan has been given approval by the planning commission, five copies of the approved future tract plan must be
                  provided for distribution to the various reviewing agencies and the inspections office.
                  4-1.4. Completeness: If any of the above required information is omitted or misrepresented on the plat, the City of Quitman Zoning Administrator may refuse to review
                  the plat and shall return the plat to the subdivider to be completed or revised.
                  4-1.5. Approval by Individual Agencies: No preliminary plat shall be approved by the planning commission unless it is approved by the city engineer and the
                  commissioner of health. Said agencies shall, with or without modification, approve or disapprove the preliminary plat to the extent that each has jurisdiction. If the plat is
                  rejected, the respective reviewing agency shall provide the planning commission with a written statement specifying all respects where the plat fails to comply.
                  4-1.6. Staff Development Review Committee: Upon receipt of the filing of the preliminary plat, the zoning administrator shall prepare those materials for presentation to
                  the staff development review committee. The staff development review committee shall review the preliminary plan for technical compliance with the City of Quitman
                  Land Subdivision Ordinance, Zoning Ordinance, Comprehensive plan, and other city ordinances that might impact on the proposed land subdivision. The staff
                  development review committee shall recommend in writing approval, conditional approval, postponement or disapproval within 60 days of submission.
                  4-1.7. Coordination: It shall be the responsibility of the zoning administrator to ensure that the respective reviews of the city engineer and staff development review
                  committee are brought together in a timely fashion for proper presentation to the planning commission.

                  committee, [and] the city engineer. The planning commission shall then recommend to the city commission for preliminary approval, conditional approval, postponement
                  or disapproval within 30 days of submission.
                  4-1.9. Review by City Commission: Final review of the proposed preliminary subdivision plat shall be made by the city commission at its next regular meeting. The
                  zoning administrator shall be responsible for coordination of information to be brought before the city commission, which at a minimum shall include the
                  6/2/2019 Quitman, GA Code of Ordinances
                  150/196
                  recommendations of the staff development review committee, the city engineer, the commissioner of health, and the recommendation of the planning commission. The
                  City Commission may grant preliminary approval, conditional approval, postponement or disapproval within 30 days of submission.
                  1. Preliminary approval by the city commission means that the developer is now authorized to proceed with the preparation of the required improvements plans, outlined
                  in detail under section 4-2. No developer is now authorized to proceed with any construction or any other work in the proposed subdivision before obtaining preliminary
                  approval of these improvement plans in writing. Lots shall not be sold nor shall building construction begin at this time. Preliminary approval grants the developer a minimum time of 18 months within which he shall submit his improvements plan and final plat for approval unless a time extension is granted by the city commission
                  before the expiration of the eighteen[(18)]-month period. If, in the opinion of the staff development review committee, substantial changes have been made to the
                  approved preliminary plat, the revised plat shall be resubmitted as a new preliminary plat.
                  2. Conditional approval by the city commission means the developer may proceed after written notice from the zoning administrator, as outlined under "preliminary
                  approval," but only after he has submitted at least five copies of the corrected preliminary plan to the zoning administrator, noting thereon the condition or changes
                  required by the approval of the city commission.
                  3. Postponement by the city commission means action is delayed for specific reasons which shall be noted and transmitted in writing to the developer by the zoning
                  administrator. Postponed preliminary plans may be reconsidered by the city commission without resubmittal to the staff development review committee, the city engineer,
                  the commissioner of health and the planning commission.
                  4. Disapproval by the city commission means denial of the application for the subdivision because the developer's plans are not in compliance with this ordinance. For
                  further consideration, the developer must rework and resubmit his plans as though they were a completely new preliminary plan.
                  4-2. Improvement plans.
                  4-2.1. General Requirements: Subdivision plans receive their second official consideration as "improvement plans." These plans shall be approved by the city engineer,
                  who shall certify that the improvement plans are in conformance with this ordinance, official city specifications, and with the requirements of the approved preliminary
                  plan. No developer shall proceed with any construction work in the proposed subdivision before obtaining this approval.
                  4-2.2. Professional Engineer Required: The developer shall have a professional engineer, registered in the State of Georgia, prepare the improvement plans in conformance
                  with the format, design and improvement standards required by this ordinance and such plans shall reflect his registration.
                  4-2.3. Filing: To secure formal review of his improvement plans, the developer shall file with the zoning administrator three certified (signed and sealed by the developer's
                  professional engineer) white background prints of the improvement plans. The zoning administrator will then distribute the improvements plan to the city engineer and the
                  staff development review committee, and the city engineer shall jointly review the proposed improvement plans and shall approve or deny the proposed improvement
                  plans. The zoning administrator shall notify the city commission of the committees' action in writing.
                  a. Approval means the developer is now authorized to proceed with the physical improvements in the subdivision, after securing any required construction permits, and
                  may proceed with the preparation of the final subdivision plat.
                  b. Conditional approval means the developer may proceed as outlined in the preceding paragraph [a.], but only after he submits three certified copies of the corrected
                  improvement plans to the city engineer for his review and approval.
                  c. Denial means disapproval of the improvement plans. For further consideration, the developer must rework his plans to conform to the requirements of this ordinance,
                  and then submit the reworked plans to the zoning administrator as though they were a completely new set of plans.
                  4-2.4. Plans and Data Required for Improvement Plan Submission: The plans for the required public improvements shall be prepared for the approval by the staff
                  development review committee and city engineer prior to the construction and only after approval of the preliminary plan. Such improvement plans shall show the
                  proposed locations, sizes, types, grades and general design features of each facility, and shall be based on reliable field data. Construction plan approvals are good for 24
                  months. If the subdivision is sold prior to completion and final platting, a mandatory review by the staff development review committee and city engineer is required.
                  Failure to comply may result in revocation of construction permit after notice and hearing before the staff development review committee and city engineer. The developer
                  shall receive a minimum of five days' written notice of said hearing.
                  The improvement construction drawing shall be submitted on white background prints. The sheet size shall be 24 inches by thirty-six (36) inches unless another size is
                  approved by the city engineer. The drawing shall include the following information:
                  a. Construction plans. The developer shall provide the plan and profile of each proposed street (indicating the existing ground surface elevation and proposed street grade
                  surface elevation including extensions for a distance of 100 feet to three hundred (300) feet beyond the tract boundary) as required by the city engineer. Design shall be in
                  accordance with good engineering practices.
                  b. Street-typical sections. A typical section of each proposed street shall be submitted, showing the width of pavement and the right-of-way.
                  c. Water supply and stormwater drainage. The plan and profile of proposed distribution systems, and storm drainage sewers or other drainage ways, with grade and sizes
                  indicated. Stormwater drainage shall be consistent with city ordinances and other applicable governmental agencies. Water and sewer systems shall be approved by the
                  staff development review committee and all relevant state agencies. The plat shall not be recorded until the developer submits to the zoning administrator all final permits
                  required for the construction of all improvements from other state, local or federal agencies.
                  d. Utility service agreement. A developer's agreement for city utilities service shall be required before final development approval is granted.
                  e. Other public improvements. A plan shall be prepared for parks, recreation or other public use areas and improvements if included in the approved preliminary plan.
                  f. As-built plans. The designing engineer shall submit to the zoning administrator three sets of white background prints of certified as-built plans.

                  any other requirement of this ordinance is not maintained.
                  Section 5-9. - Public street frontage.

                  Section 4-2.11 and Section 4-2.3)
                  Section 5-11. - Lots with multiple frontage.
                  On a corner lot where the main entrance into a residence is facing a side yard, it shall be permissible for purposes of this ordinance to construe the residence to be fronting
                  on the street other than that street which said entrance faces, and side and rear yard requirements may be provided accordingly. If a building is constructed on a through lot
                  having frontage on two roads not at an intersection, a setback from each road shall be provided equal to the front yard requirement for the district in which the lot is
                  located.
                  Section 5-12. - Permitted modification of setback requirements.
                  When a building is proposed on a lot and when on either or both lots which adjoin such lot at the street right-of-way line there exists a principal building which does not
                  conform to the setback requirements of this ordinance, and the Board of Zoning Appeals finds that because of the width and shape of the lot it would impose an
                  unnecessary hardship on the owner if the rigid requirements of this ordinance were followed, the Board may allow the required setback for such building to be as follows:
                  (1)
                  where only one said adjoining lot contains a principle building with a non-conforming setback, the setback shall be the computed average of (a) the normal setback
                  requirement with (b) the nonconforming setback; or
                  (2)
                  6/2/2019 Quitman, GA Code of Ordinances
                  159/196
                  where both adjoining lots contain a principle building each with a nonconforming setback, the minimum setback shall be the computed average of the two nonconforming
                  setbacks. (See Section 10-6.3)
                  Section 5-13. - Adjoining and vacant lots of record.
                  If two or more adjoining and vacant lots of record with continuous frontage are in a single ownership any time after the adoption of this ordinance and such lots
                  individually are less than the lot width requirements for the district in which they are located, such groups of lots shall together be considered as a single lot or shall be
                  grouped into several lots of minimum permitted size; the resulting lot or lots shall be subject to the dimensional requirements of this ordinance. (See Section 4-2.11)
                  Section 5-14. - Lots of record.
                  Except as set forth in Section 5-13, any lot of record at any [the] time of the adoption of this ordinance which does not meet the minimum lot width and/or lot area
                  requirements herein provided, may be used as a building site for a single-family residence, provided the required yard setbacks are maintained. (See Section 4-2.11)
                  Section 5-15. - Permitted encroachment of yards and setbacks.
                  Architectural features such as cornices, eaves, steps, gutters, and fire escapes may project not more than three feet beyond any required setback line, except where such
                  projections would obstruct driveways which are or may be used for access for service and/or emergency vehicles.
                  Section 5-16. - Home occupations.
                  A home occupation as defined by this ordinance shall be governed by the following requirements: (See Section 4-2.8)
                  a.
                  Only residents of the dwelling may be engaged in the home occupation.
                  b.
                  The home occupation shall be clearly incidental to the residential use of the dwelling, and shall not change the essential residential character of the building.
                  c.
                  No display of products shall be visible from the street, and only products produced on the premises may be sold on the premises.
                  d.
                  Use of the building for this purpose shall not exceed 25% of one floor of the principle building.
                  e.

                  f.
                  The occupational [occupation] shall not constitute a nuisance in the neighborhood.
                  g.
                  No accessory buildings or outside storage shall be used in connection with the occupation.
                  h.

                  Said residence must be the principal residence of the owner/occupier and an affidavit to that effect shall accompany the application to the Board of Commissioners for the
                  special exception.

                  the city in emergency situations.
                  In determining whether to issue an exception under this section, alternate housing availability shall be a major determining factor to be considered by the Board of

                  Administrator.

                  (a)
                  The proposed use will not be contrary to the purpose of this ordinance.
                  (b)
                  The proposed use will not be detrimental to the use or development of adjacent properties or the general neighborhood nor affect adversely the health and safety of
                  residents and workers.
                  (c)
                  The proposed use will not constitute a nuisance or hazard because of the number of persons who will attend or use such facility, vehicular movement, noise or fumes
                  generated, or type of physical activity.
                  (d)
                  The proposed use will not be affected adversely by the existing uses, and the proposed use will be placed on a lot of sufficient size to satisfy the space requirements of said
                  use.
                  (e)
                  The parking and all development standards set forth for each particular use for which a permit may be granted have been met.
                  (f)
                  Provided, that the Board of Zoning Appeals may impose or require such additional restriction and standards as may be necessary to protect the health and safety of
                  workers and residents in the community, to protect the value and use of property in the general neighborhood; and provided, that wherever the Board of Zoning Appeals
                  shall find, in the case of any permit granted pursuant to the provisions of these regulations, that any term, condition, or restrictions upon which such permit was granted are
                  not being complied with, said Board shall rescind and revoke such permit after giving due notice to all parties concerned and granting full opportunity for a public hearing.
                  10-6.3 Request for a Variance: The Board may authorize upon appeal in specific cases such variance from the terms of these regulations as will not be contrary to the
                  public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations will, in an individual case, result in practical difficulty or
                  unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of these regulations shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done; provided, however, that a
                  variance shall not be granted for a use of land or building or structure that is prohibited by this ordinance in the district in question. Such variance may be granted in an
                  individual case upon finding by the Board that the following exists:
                  (a)

                  (g)
                  Immorality.
                  (h)

                  the signatures of the applicant, the person who is to work in applicants place and the officer, be in the hands of the Captain or Chief at least six hours before such leave is
                  to take place. This "Leave of Absence", covers periods of more than six hours. In the event of emergency this requirement may be waived by the Chief, or his designee.

                  officers shall maintain a record of such leaves in the log book so that same may not occur too often. In the event an officer wishes to be away under the terms of this
                  paragraph, he must obtain permission of the Chief in charge of his shift.
                  23.

                  use and anyone removing tools will be subject to disciplinary action. If anyone, other than the engineer, needs a tool to work on the apparatus, he must get permission from
                  the engineer. The tools will be the direct responsibility of the engineer and he will check same each morning, and report any shortage to the officer in charge or Chief.

                  4.
                  There shall be no racing of apparatus on the way to a fire, nor shall one apparatus pass another, unless it is clear that the front apparatus is having mechanical trouble. The
                  lighter Chiefs' cars, being more maneuverable, may pass when clear.
                  5.
                  Upon the sounding of an alarm in the station all members on duty shall immediately report upon the apparatus floor, whether day or night, ready to proceed to the fire if

                  6.
                  While at fires, the greatest degree of silence compatible with efficient discharge of duty shall be required and any boisterous or noisy conduct will be sufficient cause for

                  7.
                  While at fires all members shall wear the prescribed protective clothing and equipment.

                  10.
                  Incoming companies, on extra alarms, may take instructions from the Chiefs' Aide, as they are presumed to be acting under orders from the Chief in charge.
                  11.
                  In answering extra alarms, either in responding to the fire or transferring to another station, companies will be governed by orders from the dispatchers. No deviation will
                  be allowed.
                  12.
                  Upon orders from the Chief, or his authority to call the off-shift, the dispatcher shall immediately assign the duty of calling to the City Hall or a volunteer fireman. In the
                  event that another Fire Department is covering the Quitman station, the calling duty may be assigned to them.
                  13.
                  Each station to which apparatus normally transfers in the event of a multiple alarm, must maintain a complete and up-to-date list of all members of the Department

                  14.
                  In the event that it is necessary to dispatch a company which is engaged in calling the off-shift, the dispatcher will immediately assign the duty of calling to another
                  company, advising them to start at the top of the list.
                  15.

                  17.
                  Stations are furnished running cards covering their first alarm territory boxes, and will respond on first alarm without awaiting word from the dispatchers when one of

                  21.
                  In case of a working fire at the time for changing shifts, it shall be the duty of the incoming officer to check his men, and if ordered to do so, proceed to the fire location to
                  relieve the working shift. Upon relief, however, the shift being relieved shall not leave the fire without permission of the officer in charge.
                  22.
                  At a fire, upon receiving orders to take up, the company officer shall be responsible for seeing that all equipment from his apparatus is picked up and taken back to the

                  27.
                  Should a member of a company be in the act of executing an order, and a subsequent order be given by a different officer, the member shall make known to the second
                  officer that he is in the process of executing an order. In the event that the second officer insists that the second order be obeyed, the member shall execute the second
                  order, but the second officer shall assume full responsibility for the change.
                  28.
                  Members shall not idle or wander away from their companies. When sent for any piece of equipment the member shall secure it from his own apparatus, provided same is

                  considered in deciding whether an area is restricted or not. Smoking at a fire scene may be permitted by the officer in charge.
                  30.
                  Companies transferring to another area upon orders from the dispatcher shall report by radio upon leaving their station, and will proceed to the new location at normal

                  31.
                  An engine with [an] empty booster tank does not constitute reason for being out of service, provided other equipment can be used. Booster tanks shall be filled at the
                  nearest water supply.
                  32.

                  Hose in apparatus shall be completely changed at least quarterly, and at this time water shall be run through the hose being removed from the hose body.
