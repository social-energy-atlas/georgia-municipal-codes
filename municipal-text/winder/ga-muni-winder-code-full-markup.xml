PREFACE 
</p>
        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE This Code is a codification of the ordinances of the City of Winder, Georgia, of a general and permanent nature. As expressed in the Adopting Ordinance, the Code supersedes all such ordinances not included therein or recognized as continuing in force by reference thereto. 
The chapters of the Code are arranged in alphabetical order and the sections within each chapter are catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant provisions of the state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations setting forth their location within the Code volume is included at the back of this volume. The source of each section is indicated by the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the Comparative Table also appearing in the back of the volume, any ordinance included herein can be readily found in the Code. 
Numbering System 
The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash representing the chapter number and the figure after the dash indicating the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the third section of Chapter 2 is numbered 2-3. Under this system each section is identified with its chapter and, at the same time, new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper places, simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between Sections 8-2 and 8-3 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 8-2.1, 8-2.2 and 8-2.3 respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 10 and 11 it will be designated as Chapter 10.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Indices 
The indices have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indices which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this Code is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental service, by which the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to the holders of the Code with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. Each such amendment, when incorporated into the Code, may be cited as a part thereof, as provided in Section 5 of the Adopting Ordinance. 
The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.

            <p>PART I - CHARTER LAWS[1]                   Footnotes: 
                  --- (1) --- 
                  Editor's note— Georgia Laws 1974, Act No. 1165, enacted a new charter for the city, as set out in Subpart A, and repealed the city's former charter, derived from Georgia Laws 1917, page 926, as amended by: Georgia Laws 1931, page 1033; Georgia Laws 1943, page 1641; Georgia Laws 1956, page 2985; Georgia Laws 1961, page 2559; and Georgia Laws 1964, page 2347. The absence of a history note in parentheses following a particular section indicates that the section is derived unchanged from Georgia Laws 1974, Act No. 1165. 
                  Several provisions of the city's former charter laws have been deleted as being superseded by the new charter. They are provisions on zoning and planning (Georgia Laws 1938, page 1373); gas distribution (Georgia Laws 1952, page 2475); real property evaluation (Georgia Laws 1956, page 3100); and extension of corporate limits (Georgia Laws 1958, page 2390; and Georgia Laws 1960, page 2909). Provisions concerning the city-county airport authority were designated as Subpart B and have been deleted at the request of the city since the city no longer participates in the airport authority.

Any part of the City of Winder which is described in subsection (3) above as being in a particular district shall nevertheless not be included within such district if such part is not contiguous to such district.

A ratification of action taken in such a special session by the mayor and council prior to a conviction for false swearing shall not be effective. Any liability to the city arising from action by the mayor and council pursuant to a special session in which telephone notice is given, and in which the person calling the meeting is found guilty of false swearing[,] shall result in several liability for the persons so convicted. Such notice of a special meeting shall not be required and shall be considered waived if the mayor and all councilmen are present when the special meeting is called of convened.

                  Sec. 1-3. - Construction of ordinances—Generally. 
                  The same rules shall be applied in construing ordinances of this city as are applied in construing the statutes of this state, which rules are found in section 102-102, Georgia Code Annotated, and the same meanings are to be given words found in the ordinances as are given similar words found in the statutes of this state. The words "board" and "council," respectively, shall be construed to mean the mayor and council in session. 
                  (Code 1968, § 1-4) 
                  Sec. 1-4. - Same—Definitions. 
                  In the construction of this Code, and of all ordinances, the following rules shall be observed, unless such construction would be inconsistent with the manifest intent of the mayor and council: 
                  City. The words "the city" or "this city" shall be construed as if the words "of Winder" followed it. 
                  Computation of time. Whenever a notice is required to be given or an act to be done, a certain length of time before any proceeding shall be had, the day on which such notice is given, or such act is done, shall be counted in computing the time, but the day on which such proceeding is to be had shall not be counted. 
                  Councilman. The word "councilman" shall mean and refer to any person elected or appointed to that office. 
                  County. The words "the county" or "this county" shall mean the County of Barrow. 
                  Delegation of authority. Whenever a provision appears requiring the head of a department of the city to do some act or make certain inspections it is to be construed to authorize the head of the department to designate, delegate and authorize subordinates to perform the required act or make the required inspection unless the terms of the provision or section designate otherwise. 
                  Ga. Code Ann. The term "Ga. Code Ann." or words of like effect shall mean the Code of Georgia of 1933, as amended, either specifically or by implication. 
                  Gender. A word importing the masculine gender only shall extend and be applied to females and to firms, partnerships and corporations as well as to males. 
                  Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of any provision of this Code, it shall be held to be the minimum requirement adopted for the promotion of the public health, safety, comfort, convenience and general welfare. [1] Where any provision of the Code imposes greater restrictions upon the subject matter than the general provision imposed by the Code, the provision imposing the greater restriction or regulation shall be deemed to be controlling. 
                  Joint authority. All words giving a joint authority to three (3) or more persons or officers shall be construed as giving such authority to a majority of such persons or officers. 
                  Keepers and proprietors. The words "keepers" and "proprietors" shall mean and include the persons, firms, associations, corporations, clubs and partnerships, whether acting by themselves or through a servant, agent or employee.

For example, the codifier may:

                  (2)  Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles; 
                  (3)  Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the Code and, where necessary to accommodate new material, change existing section or other subdivision numbers;

                  (a)  The repeal of an ordinance shall not revive any ordinances in force before or at the time the ordinance repealed took effect. 
                  (b)  The repeal of an ordinance shall not affect any punishment or penalty incurred before the repeal took effect, nor any suit, prosecution or proceeding pending at the time of the repeal, for an offense committed or cause of action arising under the ordinance repealed.

Former Art. II, §§ 3.5-21—3.5-52, pertained to similar subject matter ad derived from Ord. W-4-94, adopted July 5, 1994. 

                  Sec. 3.5-21. - Findings; public purpose. 
                  Based on the experiences of other counties and municipalities, including, but not limited to Houston, Texas, Tucson, Arizona, Minneapolis, Minnesota, Garden City, California, Peach County, City of Lavonia, and Gwinnett County, Georgia, which experiences are found to be relevant to the problems faced by the City of Winder, and based upon the record of the public hearing on May 17, 2005, including the record of testimony by Chief Stanley Rodgers and Lt. Dennis Dorsey of the Winder Police Department, and further comments in that meeting by the public and representatives of the adult entertainment industry, the mayor and council take note of the well-known and self-evident conditions and secondary effects attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among the various communities within our country. 
                  (1)  Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments. Further, there should be a mechanism to make the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises. 
                  (2)  Certain employees of sexually oriented businesses, defined in this article as adult entertainment establishments, engage in higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments. 
                  (3)  Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur at sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live sex shows. 
                  (4)  Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades, and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of sexually oriented businesses. 
                  (5)  Numerous communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses, including, but not limited to, syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS) and genital herpes. 
                  (6)  Since 1981 and to the present, there has been an increasing cumulative number of reported cases of AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the United States. 
                  (7)  The number of cases of early (less than one (1) year) syphilis in the United States, as well as Georgia, reported annually has risen. 
                  (8)  In his report of October 22, 1986, the Surgeon General of the United States has advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be transmitted through sexual conduct, intravenous drug abuse, exposure to infected blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her newborn. 
                  (9)  According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection, as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts. 
                  (10)  Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and, in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate those activities and maintain those facilities. 
                  (11)  Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view "adult" oriented films. 
                  (12)  The findings noted in subsections (1) through (11) raise substantial governmental concerns. 
                  (13)  Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns. 
                  (14)  A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will place an incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health, safety, and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the city. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business, fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein. 
                  (15)  Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters. 
                  (16)  Requiring licenses of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects by preventing minors from working in such establishments. 
                  (17)  The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business, where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. 
                  (18)  In the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases, it is desirable to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this article is designed to prevent, or who are likely to be witnesses to such conduct. 
                  (19)  The fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this article. 
                  (20)  The barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to, and prevents conduct which leads to, the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases. 
                  (21)  The general welfare, health, morals, and safety of the citizens of the city will be promoted by the enactment of this article. 
                  It is the finding of the mayor and council that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in establishments offering live nude entertainment or "adult entertainment," (whether such alcoholic beverages are sold on the premises or not) begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. In the same manner, establishments offering cinematographic or videographic adult entertainment have the same deleterious effects on the community. 
                  Among the acts of criminal behavior found to be associated with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, live commercial nudity in general, and cinematographic or videographic adult entertainment are disorderly conduct, prostitution, public solicitation, public indecency, drug use and drug trafficking. Among the undesirable community conditions identified in other communities with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, commercial nudity in general, and cinematographic or videographic adult entertainment, are depressions of property values and acceleration of community blight in the surrounding neighborhood, increased allocation of and expenditure for law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, and increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior herein above described. The mayor and council find it is reasonable to believe that some or all of these undesirable community conditions will result in the city, as well. 
                  Furthermore, it is the finding of the mayor and council that other forms of adult entertainment including, but not limited to, adult book stores, adult novelty shops, adult video stores, peep shows, adult theaters, and massage parlors have an adverse effect upon the quality of life in surrounding communities. 
                  The mayor and council find that the negative secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments upon the city are similar whether the adult entertainment establishment features live nude dancing or sells video tapes depicting sexual activities. In addition, Gwinnett County's experience with the adult bookstore located within the county has shown that a substantial amount of activity at the bookstore involves booths which an individual may enter, view videos depicting sexual activity, and sexually interact with a bookstore patron in an adjoining booth through a hole strategically placed in the wall of adjoining booths. 
                  The city therefore finds that it is in the best interests of the health, welfare, safety and morals of the community and the preservation of its businesses, neighborhoods, and of houses of worship (religious institutions), schools, residential areas, public parks and children's daycare facilities to prevent or reduce the adverse impacts of adult entertainment establishments. Therefore, the mayor and council find that licensing and regulations are necessary for any adult entertainment establishment. The mayor and council find that these regulations promote the public welfare by furthering legitimate public and governmental interests, including but not limited to, reducing criminal activity and protecting against or eliminating undesirable community conditions and further find that such will not infringe upon the protected Constitutional rights of freedom of speech or expression, which rights are expressly acknowledged herein. To that end, this article is hereby adopted. 
                  The purpose of this article is to regulate certain types of businesses including, but not limited to, adult entertainment establishments, to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses will be curtailed. However, it is recognized that such regulation cannot de facto approach prohibition. Otherwise, a protected form of expression would vanish. This article represents a balancing of competing interests: reduced criminal activity and protection of the neighborhoods through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments versus the protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons.

                  Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. (Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (NOTE: accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance requirements) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank.

                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty (50) per cent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
                  Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds fifty (50) per cent of the market value of the structure prior to the "start of construction" of the improvement. NOTE: The market value of the structure should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
                  For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include (1) those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project, or (2) any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure". 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds fifty (50) per cent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. 
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  (a)  The city zoning appeal board as established by the city shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this chapter. 
                  (b)  The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the city building inspector or his/her designee in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. 
                  (c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the city zoning appeal board may appeal such decision to the Superior Court of Barrow County, as provided in Section 5-4-1 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated. 
                  (d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (g)  In reviewing such requests, the city zoning appeal board shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this chapter. 
                  (h)  Conditions for variances: 
                  (1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause, 
                  b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship, and; 
                  c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  (2)  The provisions of this chapter are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (4)  The city building inspector or his/her designee shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (i)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this chapter, the city zoning appeals board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

                  ARTICLE III. - PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

                  Sec. 9.5-31. - General standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure; 
                  (2)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage; 
                  (3)  New construction or substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
                  (4)  Elevated buildings. All new construction or substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater. 
                  a.  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
                  (i)  Provide a minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
                  (ii)  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot above grade; and, 
                  (iii)  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both direction. 
                  b.  So as not to violate the "lowest floor" criteria of this chapter, the unfinished or flood resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area, and 
                  c.  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms. 
                  (5)  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
                  (6)  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces. 
                  (7)  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system; 
                  (8)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters; 
                  (9)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding, and; 
                  (10)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure, which is not compliant with the provisions of this chapter, shall be undertaken only if the nonconformity is not furthered, extended or replaced.

                  Sec. 9.5-32. - Specific standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and/or substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and/or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one (1) foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 9.5-31(4), "elevated buildings". 
                  a.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one (1) foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  (2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH zones, may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to one (1) foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in subsection 9.5-23(6). 
                  (3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
                  a.  All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on: (1) individual lots or parcels, (2) in new and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, (3) in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or (4) on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than one (1) foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  b.  Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
                  (i)  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one (1) foot above the level of the base flood elevation, or 
                  (ii)  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than thirty-six (36) inches in height above grade. 
                  c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (Ref. subsection 9.5-31(6) above) 
                  d.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
                  (i)  Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days. 
                  (ii)  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions), or 
                  (iii)  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "new construction", including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsection 9.5-32(3)a.c., above. 
                  (4)  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 9.5-7, are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
                  b.  Only if subsection 9.5-32(4)a. above is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of article III. 
                  (Ord. (W-1-10) of 1-5-10) 
                  Sec. 9.5-33. - Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodway (A-zones). 
                  Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 9.5-7, where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A-zones), OR where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 9.5-7, then the city building inspector or his/her designee shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of article III. Only if data are not available from these sources, then the following provisions ((2) and (3)) shall apply: 
                  (2)  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or twenty (20) feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in more than a one (1) foot increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
                  (3)  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three (3) feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. (NOTE: Require the lowest floor to be elevated one (1) foot above the estimated base flood elevation in A-zone areas where a limited detail study has been completed). Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 9.5-31(4) "elevated buildings". 
                  a.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than three (3) feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site.

The lien of said occupation tax shall become fixed on and date from the time when such tax or any installment thereof becomes delinquent. The execution shall be levied by the police chief or other appropriate officer of said city upon the property of defendant located in said jurisdiction, and sufficient property shall be advertised and sold to pay the amount of said execution, with interest and costs. All other proceedings in relation thereto shall be had as is provided by ordinances and charter of said city and the laws of the state, and the defendant in said execution shall have rights of defense, by affidavit of illegality and otherwise, which are provided by the applicable laws in regard to tax executions. When a nulla bona entry has been entered by proper authority upon an execution issued by the planning director or designee's office against any person defaulting on the occupation tax, the person against who the entry was made shall not be allowed or entitled to have or collect any fees or charges whatsoever for services rendered after the entry of the nulla bona. If, at any time after the entry of nulla bona has been made, the person against whom the execution issues pays the tax in full together with all interest and costs accrued on the tax, the person may collect any fees and charges due him or her as though he or she had never defaulted in the payment of the taxes.

                  Editor's note— It should be noted that O.C.G.A. § 36-32-1 et seq. provides for the establishment of municipal courts; hence, the term recorder's court has been changed to municipal court and the term recorder has been changed to municipal court judge. Formerly set out as ch. 22, §§ 22-1—22-4, provisions pertaining to such court have been transferred to ch. 15.5, §§ 15.5-1—15.5-4 in order to preserve alphabetical sequence of chapter titles in the Code. Where the term recorder's court appears throughout the Code it will be changed to municipal court as pages are necessarily affected through the supplement service.

                  (i)  Deadline for approval or rejection of application. 
                  (1)  The commission shall approve or reject an application for a certificate of appropriateness within not more than forty-five (45) days after the filing thereof by the owner or occupant of an historic property or of a structure, site, or work of art located within an historic district. Evidence of approval shall be by a certificate of appropriateness issued by the commission. 
                  (2)  Failure of the commission to act within said forty-five (45) days shall constitute approval, and no other evidence of approval shall be needed. 
                  (j)  Actions to be taken by commission upon rejection of application for certificate. 
                  (1)  In the event that the commission rejects an application, it shall state its reasons for doing so and shall transmit a record of such actions and reasons, in writing, to the applicant. The commission may suggest alternative courses of action it thinks proper if it disapproves of the application submitted. The applicant, if he or she so desires, may make modifications to the plans and may resubmit the application at any time after doing so. 
                  (2)  In cases where the application covers a material change in the appearance of a structure which would require the issuance of a building permit, the rejection of the application for a certificate of appropriateness by the commission shall be binding upon the building inspector or other administrative officer charged with issuing building permits and, in such case, no building permit shall be issued. 
                  (k)  Undue hardship. Where, by reason of unusual circumstances, the strict application of any provision of this article would result in the exceptional practical difficulty or undue hardship upon any owner of a specific property, the commission, in passing upon applications, shall have the power to vary or modify strict adherence to said provisions, or to interpret the meaning of said provisions, so as to relieve such difficulty or hardship; provided such variances, modifications, or interpretations shall remain in harmony with the general purpose and intent of said provisions, so that the architectural or historical integrity or character of the property shall be conserved and substantial justice done. In granting variances, the commission may impose such reasonable and additional stipulations and conditions as will, in its judgment, best fulfill the purpose of this article. 
                  An undue hardship shall be a situation not of the person's own making, which is: 
                  a.  A problem unique to a specific property; or 
                  b.  A conflict with another ordinance of the city created by compliance with the provisions of this article. 
                  (l)  Conformance with certificate. Work not in accordance with an issued certificate of appropriateness shall be halted before it is completed. 
                  (m)  Certificate void if construction not commenced. A certificate of appropriateness shall become void unless construction is commenced within six (6) months of the date of issuance.

                  (n)  Recording of applications for certificates. The commission shall keep a public record of all applications for certificates of appropriateness and of all the commission's proceedings in connection with said applications. 
                  (o)  Acquisition of property. The commission may, where such action is authorized by the local governing body and is reasonably necessary or appropriate for the preservation of a unique historic property, enter into negotiations with the owner for the acquisition by gift, purchase, exchange, or otherwise, of the property or any interest therein. 
                  (p)  Appeals. Any person adversely affected by any determination made by the commission relative to the issuance or denial of a certificate of appropriateness may appeal such determination to the city council; the appeal must be applied for within fifteen (15) days after notification is sent. The city may approve, modify, or reject the determination made by the commission, if the governing body finds that the commission abused its discretion in reaching its decision. Appeals from decisions of the city made pursuant to the Georgia Historic Preservation Act may be taken to the superior court of the county, in the manner provided by law, for appeals from conviction for municipal or county ordinance violations.

                  Sec. 23-101. - Notification of violation. 
                  When the city administrator finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city administrator may serve upon that user a written notice of violation. Within ten (10) days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the city administrator. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the city administrator to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation.

                  The city administrator may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to sections 23-104 and 23-105 of this article and shall be judicially enforceable.

                  The city administrator may order a user which has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the city administrator and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.

                  Sec. 23-104. - Compliance orders. 
                  When the city administrator finds that user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city administrator may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.

                  When the city administrator finds that user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirements, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the city administrator may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to: 
                  (1)  Immediately comply with all requirements; and 
                  (2)  Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. 
                  Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.

Such fines shall be assessed on a per-violation, per-day basis. In the case of monthly or other long term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation. 
                  (b)  Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after thirty (30) calendar days, be assessed an additional penalty of ten (10) percent of the unpaid balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of one (1) percent per month. A lien against the user's property will be sought for unpaid charges, fines and penalties. 
                  (c)  Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for the city administrator to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount within fifteen (15) days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit, the city administrator may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event the user's appeal is successful, the payment, along with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user. The city administrator may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine. 
                  (d)  Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.

                  Sec. 23-107. - Emergency suspensions. 
                  The city administrator may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The city administrator may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment. 
                  (1)  Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the city administrator may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The city administrator may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the city administrator that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in section 23-108 of this article are initiated against the user. 
                  (2)  A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence to the city administrator prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing, under sections 23-103 or 23-108 of this article. 
                  Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section.

                  In addition to the provisions in section 23-56 of this article, any user who violates the following conditions is subject to discharge termination: 
                  (1)  Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions; 
                  (2)  Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge; 
                  (3)  Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents and characteristics prior to discharge; 
                  (4)  Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring or sampling; or 
                  (5)  Violation of the pretreatment standards in division 2 of this article. 
                  Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under section 23-103 of this article why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the city administrator shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.

                  When the city administrator finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city administrator may petition the Superior Court for Barrow County, Georgia, through the city's attorney, for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order or other requirement imposed by this article on activities of the user. The city administrator may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.

In the case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation. Each day that a violation occurs or continues shall be considered a separate offense. 
                  (b)  The city administrator may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the city. 
                  (c)  In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice requires. 
                  (d)  Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.

                  (a)  A violation of or failure to comply with any of the provisions of this article, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, including the willful furnishing of false information relative to same for the use of the sewerage system, shall be and hereby is declared to be a misdemeanor. Upon trial in municipal court of the city, and conviction, any person or user in violation of or failing to comply with any of the provisions of this article or the use of any of the POTW in violation of this article, shall be punished by a fine of not less than one hundred dollars ($100.00) nor more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per violation per day, or by imprisonment of not more than the maximum length of time as provided by the City Charter, or both, for each violation. Each day a violation occurs or continues shall constitute a separate violation hereunder. Every person concerned in the violation of the provisions of this article or failure to comply with the same, or who furnishes false information relative to his use of the POTW aforesaid whether he directly commits the acts or aids and abets same and whether present or absent, may be proceeded against and held as a principal. 
                  (b)  A user who willfully or negligently introduces any substance into the POTW which causes personal injury or property damage shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor and be subject to a penalty of at least one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per violation per day, or be subject to imprisonment for not more than the maximum length of time provided by the City Charter, or both. This penalty shall be in addition to any other cause of action for personal injury or property damage available under state law. 
                  (c)  A user who knowingly makes any false statements, representations or certifications in any application, record, report, plan or other documentation filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this article, wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this article shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than the maximum length of time as provided by the City Charter, or both.

                  Sec. 23-131. - Upset. 
                  (a)  For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
                  (b)  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection (c) of this section are met. 
                  (c)  A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
                  (1)  An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset; 
                  (2)  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 
                  (3)  The user has submitted the following information to the city administrator within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five (5) days): 
                  a.  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
                  b.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
                  c.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
                  (d)  In any enforcement proceedings, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
                  (e)  Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
                  (f)  Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails.

                  A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in section 23-21(a) of this article or the specific prohibitions in section 23-21(b)(3) through (19) of this article if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either: 
                  (1)  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or 
                  (2)  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.

                  (a)  For the purposes of this section: 
                  (1)  "Bypass" means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a user's treatment facility. 
                  (2)  "Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected not to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
                  (b)  A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provisions of subsections (c) and (d) of this section. 
                  (c)  (1)  If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the city administrator, at least ten (10) days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
                  (2)  A user shall submit oral notice to the city administrator of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within twenty-four (24) hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five (5) days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The city administrator may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within twenty-four (24) hours. 
                  (d)  (1)  Bypass is prohibited, and the city administrator may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless: 
                  a.  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage, 
                  b.  There are not feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
                  c.  The user submitted notices as required under subsection (c) of this section. 
                  (2)  The city administrator may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the city administrator determines that it will meet the three (3) conditions listed in subsection (d)(1) of this section.

                  (a)  It is the intent of the city to distribute the cost of operation and maintenance of treatment works owned or controlled by the city to each user in proportion to such user's contribution to the total waste loading of the treatment works. 
                  (b)  The approving authority shall grant no quantity discounts to large volume users. 
                  (c)  User charges under this article shall be fixed from time to time by the mayor and council. 
                  (d)  Bills under this article will be sent by mail to all customers on a monthly basis, stating the amount and date due. Each customer is responsible for remitting payment at the billing interval. Payment shall be made to the city. 
                  (e)  Persons not having paid their bills under this article within fifteen (15) days of the date of billing will be delinquent. A notice shall be sent to them through the United States mail. If the customer responds before the final termination date, the person(s) designated by the mayor or city administrator is authorized to set up a schedule of acceptable payment arrangements with the customer. If such bill is not paid within fifteen (15) days, the potable public water connection serving the premises will be turned off and will not be turned on again until said bill is paid. 
                  (f)  In case a person discharging wastes into the city sanitary sewer system does not procure his water supply from the city, and becomes delinquent in his payment of the surcharge under this division, his connection with the city sewer system will be severed and will only be reconnected at his expense. 
                  (g)  When sewer service has been disconnected for nonpayment of charges therefor, or for nonpayment of any other charges lawfully imposed, upon payment of such charges and upon payment of an additional fee fixed from time to time by the mayor and council, sewer service shall be resumed to the affected premises. 
                  (h)  In the event sewer charges remain unpaid under this article for fifteen (15) days after the bill or account for such service has been rendered to the customer, execution shall be issued in favor of the city against such delinquent user for the amount of such unpaid charges, which execution shall be issued and enforced, levied and collected in the same manner as other executions running in favor of the city. 
                  (i)  The approving authority shall review user charges annually and shall revise them as necessary in order to reflect actual costs incurred in the operation and maintenance of treatment works owned or controlled by the city. 
                  (j)  In addition to all other rates, charges, penalties, fees, expenses and cost otherwise provided for in this chapter, the city may also collect all costs incurred for the collection of delinquent utility accounts, including, but not limited to, postage expenses, late fees as established by resolution or ordinance of the council from time to time, court filing fees, attorney's fees incurred by the city, and fees paid to third-party collection agencies. The city is authorized to use third-party collection agencies to collect delinquent utility accounts and all cost, fees and expenses of such third-party agencies shall be the responsibility of the delinquent customer.

                  Sewer use surcharges will be applied for discharges having a five-day BOD greater than two hundred fifty (250) mg/l, for discharges containing more than two hundred fifty (250) mg/l of suspended solids, for discharges containing more than twenty (20) mg/l of ammonia nitrogen, and for discharges which exceed maximum permitted volume. 
                  (1)  For the purposes of applying surcharges, it has been determined that the costs of operating the POTW can reasonably be subdivided into four (4) components, as follows: 
                  a.  Flow related components, including collection system elements, pumping facilities and hydraulic capacity at the treatment facilities, which together make up twenty (20) per cent of overall operating costs. 
                  b.  Oxygen demand components, including biological treatment process elements, which together make up thirty-five (35) per cent of overall operating costs. 
                  c.  Solids handling components, including clarifiers, digesters, drying beds and sludge disposal facilities, which together make up twenty-five (25) per cent of overall operating costs. 
                  d.  Ammonia nitrogen handling components, including a portion of the biological treatment process elements which together make up twenty (20) per cent of overall operating costs. 
                  (2)  In any case where wastewater flow volume exceeds permit laws, or where the wastewater strength exceeds the surcharge limits established by this article, surcharge factors will be computed and applied to the user charges which would otherwise be due. Surcharge factors will be calculated for any or all components exceeding the surcharge limits, and individual components added together to produce a total surcharge factor to be applied as follows: 
                  a.  Using twenty-four-hour composite samples: 
                  Surcharge Factor = 1.0 + (0.20) [ Actual Flow / Permitted Flow ] + (0.35)  [ Actual BOD / 250 ] + (0.25) [ Actual SS / 250 ] + (0.20) [ Actual NH / 320 ] 
                  b.  Using a single grab sample: 
                  Surcharge Factor = 1.0 + (0.20) [ Actual Flow / Permitted Flow ] + (0.35)  [ Actual BOD / 800 ] + (0.25) [ Actual SS / 800 ] + (0.20) [ Actual NH / 360 ]

                  (b)  Notification. 
                  (1)  When the FOG control program manager has reason to believe that grounds exist for permit suspension or revocation, he/she shall give written notice thereof by certified mail to the food service establishment setting forth a statement of the facts and grounds deemed to exist. The food service establishment shall have an opportunity to respond to the allegations set forth in the notice by presenting written or oral evidence within ten (10) calendar days after the notice. The director shall render a final decision in writing within thirty (30) calendar days following receipt of the FSE's response. The written decision and order of the director shall be sent by certified mail to the food service establishment at the food service establishment's business address. Upon an order of suspension or revocation by the FOG control program manager becoming final, the food service establishment shall immediately cease and desist its discharge and shall have no right to discharge any wastewater containing FOG directly or indirectly into the city's sewer system for the duration of the suspension. All costs for physically terminating and reinstating service shall be paid by the food service establishment. Any owner or responsible management employee of the food service establishment shall be bound by the order of suspension or revocation. Upon an order of revocation by the FOG control program manager becoming final, the food service establishment shall permanently lose all rights to discharge any wastewater containing FOG directly or indirectly to the city's sewer system. All costs for physical termination shall be paid by the food service establishment. An order of permit suspension or revocation issued by the FOG control program manager shall be final in all respects on the sixteenth (16th day after it is mailed to the food service establishment unless responded to by the FSE, in which case the decision of the director is final when issued. 
                  (c)  Damage to facilities or interruption of normal operations of the sewer system. Any person who discharges any waste which causes contributes to any sewer blockage, sanitary sewer overflows, obstruction, interference, damage, or any other impairment to the city's sewer system and/or equipment, or to the operation of those facilities and/or equipment shall be liable for all costs required to clean and/or repair the facilities and/or equipment, together with expenses incurred by the city to resume normal operations.

The total amount shall be payable within forty-five (45) days of invoicing by the city. Any person who discharges a waste which causes or contributes to the city violating its discharge requirements established by any regulatory agency incurring additional expenses or suffering losses or damage to the facilities and/or equipment shall be liable for any costs or expenses incurred by the city, including regulatory fines, penalties, and assessments made by other agencies or a court. 
                  (d)  Termination of water service to the food service establishment. City, by order of the FOG control program manager, may physically terminate water service to any property as follows: 
                  (1)  If so ordered in any order of suspension or revocation of a permit; or 
                  (2)  Upon the failure of a person not holding a valid FOG wastewater discharge permit to immediately cease the discharge, whether direct or indirect, to the city's sewer system after the issuance of a final order or suspension or revocation. 
                  (3)  All costs for physical termination of the water service shall be paid by the owner or operator of the food service establishment as well as all costs for reinstating service. 
                  (e)  Emergency suspension order. The city may, by order of the FOG control program manager or designee suspend water service when the FOG control program manager or designee determines that such suspension is necessary in order to stop an actual or impending discharge which presents or may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health and welfare of persons, or to the environment, or may cause sanitary sewer overflows, sewer blockages, interference to the city's sewer facilities, or may cause the city to violate any state or federal law or regulation. Any discharger notified of and subject to an emergency suspension order shall immediately cease and desist the discharge of all wastewater containing FOG to the sewer system.

                  (Ord. (W-7-10) of 6-8-10) 
                  Sec. 24-4. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices. 
                  (a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land disturbing activities if requirements of the ordinance and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections 24-4(b) and (c). The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit. 
                  (b)  Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
                  (1)  Best management practices as set forth in subsection 24-4(b) and (c) shall be required for all land disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. section 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. section 12-7-6 subsection (b). 
                  (2)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. section 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than twenty-five (25) nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten (10) nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five (5) acres. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to subsection (f) of Code section 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
                  (5)  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsections (c)(15) and (16), in light of O.C.G.A. section 12-7-6(c). 
                  (c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. section 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  (7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in runoff water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. section 12-7-1 et seq.; 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)  Land disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection 24-4(b)(2); 
                  (15)  Except as provided in paragraph (16) of this subsection, there is established a twenty-five-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. section 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the groundwater table year round; for which groundwater is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow, Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least twenty-five (25) feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within twenty-five (25) degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than fifty (50) feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (16)  There is established a fifty-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of twenty-five (25) gallons per minute or less shall have a twenty-five-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.  No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within twenty-five (25) degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than fifty (50) feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines. 
                  c.  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. section 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsection 24-4(b) and (c) of this article. 
                  d.  The fact that land disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
                  (Ord. (W-7-10) of 6-8-10) 
                  Sec. 24-5. - Application/permit process. 
                  (a)  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
                  (b)  Application requirements. 
                  (1)  No person shall conduct any land disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the City of Winder without first obtaining a permit from the building inspector or his/her designee to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
                  (2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the building inspector or his/her designee and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection 24-5(c). Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of subsection 24-4(b) and (c) will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by two (2) copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
                  (3)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to paragraph (5) subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. section 12-5-23, provided that such fees shall not exceed eighty dollars ($80.00) per acre of land disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. section 12-7-8 half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to paragraph (9) or (10) of O.C.G.A. section 12-7-17 shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  (4)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within thirty-five (35) days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within thirty-five (35) days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by subsections 24-4(c)(15) and (16) has been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per subsection 24-5(b)(6), have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within thirty-five (35) days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within thirty-five (35) days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
                  (5)  If a permit applicant has had two (2) or more violations of previous permits, this article section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three (3) years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
                  (6)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, three thousand dollars ($3,000.00) per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  (c)  Plan requirements. 
                  (1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in subsections 24-4(b) and (c), or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this article. The plan for the land disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and stormwater management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. section 12-7-20.

                  Sec. 24-6. - Inspection and enforcement. 
                  (a)  The City of Winder will periodically inspect the sites of land disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article. 
                  (b)  The local issuing authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within twelve (12) months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975. 
                  (c)  The City of Winder shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this article, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land disturbing activities. 
                  (d)  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
                  (e)  The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. section 12-7-8(a). The district or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
                  (f)  The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to [O.C.G.A.] section 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. section 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. section 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have ninety (90) days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within ninety (90) days after notification by the division, the division shall revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority.

The plan shall consist of hydrologic and hydraulic computations as well as a drainage area map with supporting details. This article shall apply to any road construction, commercial, industrial, recreational, institutional, or residential development; however, the following are exempt from this requirement: 
                  (1)  Residential development involving less than five (5) units or less than five (5) lots; 
                  (2)  Projects undertaken by any federal, state county, or municipal government, governmental authority, or public utility. 
                  (3)  Any proposed development which will result in an increase in runoff for a ten-year frequency storm of less than one (1) cfs. Hydrologic and hydraulic computations to support such a conclusion must be submitted to the city justifying this exemption. 
                  All residential developments subject to this chapter shall provide for open space in the development in accordance with the City of Winder Subdivision regulations or the Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance. Unless otherwise provided by ordinance, all commercial and industrial developments shall provide open space in the amount of five (5) per cent (minimum) of the area of the total development. Open space shall be defined as an area of land or water that is permanently set aside through dedication, reservation or designation. Open space may be reserved and used for preservation, required buffers, landscaping, leisure use, and stormwater management purposes but should not contain impervious surfaces, buildings or large structures. Open space does not include public rights-of-ways. The provisions of this section and any exceptions thereto, shall be interpreted, administered and applied by the City of Winder Planning Department, unless these duties are otherwise assigned by the Winder City Council. 
                  (b)  Easements required. Any stormwater pipe or drainage facility that is designed to serve more than one (1) property or that is to be connected to the city stormwater system, shall be approved by the city before it is installed and shall be dedicated to the city by easement upon the completion of installation.

                  Sec. 24-54. - Standards for stormwater detention. 
                  (a)  The calculated peak rate of stormwater runoff resulting from a ten-year return frequency twenty-four-hour-duration flood shall be no greater after development of the site than that which would result from a ten-year return frequency twenty-four-hour-duration flood on the same site prior to development of the site. 
                  (b)  Adequate attention must be given to safety and sanitation in the design of any detention facility. Sufficient information shall be shown on the plat to provide for proper construction of the facility. Sufficient design information to show that the facility will operate as required will be provided to the city building inspector for review. This shall include the existing or before-development peak discharge, the after-development peak discharge, and volume of runoff based on the proposed development, as well as all necessary computations used to determine the reduced peak flow. The capacity of the facility shall be sufficient to control the volume of stormwater runoff resulting from a ten-year frequency twenty-four-hour-duration flood within the peak rate of flow requirements stated above. The maintenance of the stormwater detention facilities will be the responsibility of the developer or home association if such organization is created. 
                  (c)  Adequate erosion and sediment control measures shall be employed during the developments construction phase to ensure that the storm drainage and detention facilities perform as designed. 
                  (d)  Water quality. All stormwater runoff generated from a site shall be adequately treated before discharge. It will be presumed that a stormwater management system complies with this requirement if: 
                  (1)  It is sized to treat the prescribed water quality treatment volume from the site, as defined in the most recent edition of the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual; 
                  (2)  Appropriate structural stormwater controls or nonstructural practices are selected, designed, constructed or preserved, and maintained according to the specific criteria in the most recent addition of the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual and in accordance to the retrofit guidelines; and 
                  (3)  Runoff from hotspot land uses and activities identified by the City of Winder are adequately treated and addressed through the use of appropriate structural stormwater controls, nonstructural practices and pollution prevention practices. 
                  (e)  Stream channel protection. For the purposes of this chapter, "channel" means a natural or artificial watercourse with a definite bed and banks that conducts continuously or periodically flowing water. Protection of stream channels from bank and bed erosion and degradation shall be provided by using all of the following three (3) approaches: 
                  (1)  Preservation, restoration and/or reforestation (with native vegetation) of the applicable stream buffer; 
                  (2)  Twenty-four-hour extended detention storage of the one-year, twenty-four-hour return frequency storm event; 
                  This requirement may be adjusted or waived by the city engineer for sites that discharge directly into larger streams, rivers, wetlands, or lakes, or to a manmade channel or conveyance system where the reduction in these flows will not have an impact on upstream or downstream stream bank or channel integrity. 
                  (3)  Erosion prevention measures such as energy dissipation and velocity control. 
                  (f)  Overbank flooding protection. 
                  Overbank flood protection means measures taken to prevent an increase in the frequency and magnitude of out-of-bank flooding (i.e. flow events that exceed the capacity of the channel and enter the floodplain), and that are intended to protect downstream properties from flooding for the two-year through twenty-five-year frequency storm events. 
                  Downstream overbank flood and property protection shall be provided by controlling (attenuating) the post-development peak discharge rate to the pre-development rate for the twenty-five-year, twenty-four-hour return frequency storm event. If control of the one-year, twenty-four-hour storm under section 4.2 is exempted, then peak discharge rate attenuation of the two-year through the twenty-five-year return frequency storm event must be provided. 
                  This requirement may be adjusted or waived by the city engineer for sites where a post-development downstream analysis shows that uncontrolled post-development conditions will not increase downstream peak flows, or that meeting the requirement will cause greater peak flow downstream impacts than the uncontrolled post-development conditions.

                  (b)  Bond provision. The city building inspector shall have the authority to require a performance bond equal in amount of the work to be performed to ensure proper construction of the storm drainage and detention facilities in accordance with the approved plan. 
                  (c)  Permits. The stormwater drainage and detention plan submittal shall be accompanied by a thirty-dollar review fee unless such plan is included as part of a subdivision plat review, in which case the fee shall be waived. No grading or building permits shall be issued until the plan as outlined herein is approved by the city building inspector or his designated representative. All final plats for residential development subject to this chapter shall include the name of any and all parties responsible for the maintenance of any stormwater detention ponds, stormwater systems, or the like, as well as any appurtenances relating thereto. 
                  (d)  Inspection and right-of-entry. The city building inspector or his designated representatives may enter during all reasonable hours any property under proposed or existing development and construction. The employees may make inspections of the storm drainage and detention facilities for the purpose of determining plan requirements or compliance with ordinance provisions. 
                  (e)  Notice of violation. Whenever the city building inspector determines that activity on a property does not comply with the approved storm drainage and detention facilities construction plans, he may issue a notice of violation. The notice of violation of the provisions of this article or of any rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto, shall be to the owner of the property or his agent and shall: 
                  (1)  Be in writing; 
                  (2)  Include a description of the property sufficient for identification of where said violation has occurred; 
                  (3)  List the specific requirements of the approved plan which have been violated. 
                  (f)  Appeals. Appeals from decisions of the city building inspector relative to this article shall be made to the city council. Such appeal shall be filed with the city clerk within thirty (30) days of the written decision of the city building inspector. 
                  (g)  Penalties. Any person, firm, or corporation violating any provision of this article shall be fined one hundred dollars ($100.00) for each offense and a separate offense shall be deemed committed on each day a violation continues.

                  ARTICLE V. - MULBERRY RIVER WATERSHED PROTECTION 

                  Sec. 24-56. - Findings and purpose. 
                  (a)  Findings of fact. In order to provide for the health, safety and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within the city and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be assured. The ability of natural systems to filter stormwater runoff can be threatened by unrestricted development. Land disturbing activities associated with development can increase erosion and sedimentation which threatens the storage capacity of reservoirs. In addition, stormwater runoff, particularly from impervious surfaces, can introduce toxicant, nutrients and sediment into drinking water supplies, making water treatment more complicated and expensive and rendering water resources unusable for recreation. Industrial land uses that involve the manufacture, use, transport and storage of hazardous or toxic waste materials result in the potential risk of contamination of nearby public drinking water supplies. 
                  (b)  Purpose. The purpose of this article is to establish measures to protect the quality and quantity of the present and future water supply of the city; to minimize the transport of pollutants and sediment to the water supply; and to maintain the yield of the water supply watershed. This article shall apply to the portions of the following watershed, which occur within the jurisdiction of the city and are herein identified as water supply watershed Mulberry River.

                  ARTICLE VI. - WETLANDS PROTECTION 

                  Sec. 24-71. - Purpose. 
                  The wetlands in the city are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; and open space and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well-being of many communities within the state. 
                  Nationally, a considerable number of these important natural resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution and other acts. Piecemeal or cumulative losses will, over time, destroy additional wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare. 
                  It is therefore necessary for the city to ensure maximum protection for wetlands by discouraging development activities that may adversely affect wetlands. 
                  The purpose of this article is to promote wetland protection, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational and aesthetic values. Activities that may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practicable as determined through a permitting process. The objective of this article is to protect wetlands from alterations that will significantly affect or reduce their primary functions for water quality, floodplain and erosion control, groundwater recharge, aesthetic nature and wildlife habitat. 
                  For the purposes of this article, the term "city engineer" shall mean the person or firm designated as the city engineer of the City of Winder, or in the absence of a city engineer, any other person(s) or company designated by the Winder City Council.

                  Sec. 24-72. - Definitions. 
                  The following words and terms are defined for use in this article. Where other terms or words require definition, please refer to the 1987 U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Wetlands Manual or call the District Corps office in Savannah, at 1-800-448-2402. 
                  Functions: The beneficial roles that wetlands serve, including storage, conveyance and attenuation of floodwater and stormwater; protection of water quantity and quality and reduction of erosion; habit for wildlife, including rare, threatened and endangered species; food chain support for a wide variety of wildlife and fisheries; educational, historical and archeological value protection; and scenic, aesthetic and recreational amenities. 
                  Generalized wetland map: Wetlands identified on the U.S. Department of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service, National Wetlands Inventory Maps. 
                  Hydric soils: Soils that form as a result of saturated soil conditions. A list of these soils is maintained by the soil conservation service. 
                  Hydrophytic vegetation: Macrophytic plants tolerant of or dependent on saturated soil conditions. 
                  Jurisdictional determination: An official, written statement or map signed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers or, in the case of coastal marshlands, the state department of natural resources. 
                  Jurisdictional wetland: A wetland area that meets the defined requirements for wetlands as determined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
                  Regulated activity: Any activity which will, or which may reasonably be expected to, result in the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States excepting those activities exempted in section 24-75 of this article and exempted in section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act. 
                  Silviculture: The art of producing, reproducing and growing a forest of distinctive stands of trees. 
                  Temporary emergency permit: A temporary permit that may be issued in certain circumstances specified in section 24-76. 
                  Wetland: An area that is inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency and distribution sufficient to support, and under normal circumstances does support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions, commonly known as hydrophytic vegetation. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas. 
                  Wetland delineation: The establishment of wetland boundaries by a representative of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers or an authority designated by the Corps. 
                  Wetland protection district: Wetlands within the city, which are indicated on the generalized wetland map. The generalized wetland map, together with all explanatory matter thereon and attached thereto, is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this article. The generalized wetland map does not represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the city and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this article does not relieve the land owner from federal or state permitting requirements. 
                  The source wetlands map is the Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory maps. The city should consider the limitations of available map resources used to compile the generalized wetland map. To varying degrees, all maps contain systematic distortion and inaccuracy. Generally, inaccuracy grows larger with decreasing map scale. Commonly used wetland maps, such as the National Wetland Inventory (NWI) Maps, are drawn at a scale of 1:24,000. This means that one (1) inch on the map represents twenty-four thousand (24,000) inches on the ground, or two thousand (2,000) feet (approximately two-fifths ( 2/5 ) of a mile). Maps of this scale cannot define wetland boundaries in a legally defensible way. In addition, many small and isolated wetlands may not be shown on these maps. For these reasons, the generalized wetland map adopted by the city can only be regarded as a general reference document, which may serve a variety of functions, such as indicating the need for seeking advice or a wetland determination from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. A generalized wetland map, at a scale of 1:24,000, cannot be used to delineate, in a legally defensible manner, the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands. Formal delineation of wetlands that are protected by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, is vested with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture is the lead agency for making wetland delineations on agricultural lands.

                  Sec. 24-74. - Local development permit requirements. 
                  No regulated activity will be allowed within the wetland protection district without written permission from the city engineering department in the form of a local development permit. Issuance of a local development permit is contingent on full compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable regulations. All activities that are not identified in section 24-75 or by other local development ordinances, shall be prohibited without prior issuance of a local development permit. If the area proposed for development is located within fifty (50) feet of the wetland protection district boundary, as determined from the generalized wetland map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required. If the Corps determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site and that a section 404 permit or letter of permission is required, a local development permit will be issued only following issuance of the section 404 permit or letter of permission.

                  Sec. 24-75. - Permitted uses. 
                  The following uses shall be allowed as of right within a wetland protection district to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law, including laws of trespass, and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining or dredging except as provided herein. 
                  (1)  Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish and other wildlife, provided it does not affect waters of the state or of the United States in such a way that would require an individual 404 permit. 
                  (2)  Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding and canoeing. 
                  (3)  Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the state forestry commission and as specified in section 404 of the Clean Water Act. 
                  (4)  The cultivation of agricultural crops. Agricultural activities shall be subject to best management practices approved by the state department of agriculture. 
                  (5)  The pasturing of livestock, provided that riparian wetlands are protected, that soil profiles are not disturbed and that approved agricultural best management practices are followed. 
                  (6)  Education, scientific research and nature trails. 
                  The activities listed in this section are exempted from section 404 regulations provided they do not have impacts on a navigable waterway that would necessitate acquisition of an individual 404 permit. However, under section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act, a permit may be required in some circumstances. 
                  Section 404 does not require permits for normal, ongoing silvicultural activities. However, section 404 does list some required performance standards and fifteen (15) specific road construction best management practices (BMPs) that must be followed in order to qualify for such an exemption. 
                  Under section 404, normal on-going agricultural activities are exempted from 404 regulations and do not require a permit. Normal agricultural activities include planting and harvesting of crops and pasturing of livestock. 
                  Under provisions of the Food Securities Act of 1985 (the so-called "swampbuster provisions") eligibility for all U.S. Department of Agriculture programs is denied to farms that convert wetlands to croplands. These programs include USDA price and income supports, disaster payments, crop insurance, Farmers Home Administration loans, Commodity Credit Corporation storage payments, farm storage facility loans, Conservation Reserve Program payments, and other programs under which payments are made to the farmer with respect to commodities produced.

                  Sec. 24-76. - Temporary emergency permit. 
                  A temporary emergency permit can be issued by the city for the following reasons: 
                  (1)  Maintenance or repair of lawfully located roads or structures and of facilities used in the service of the public to provide transportation, electric, gas, water, telephone, telegraph, telecommunication or other services, provided that such roads, structures or facilities are not materially changed or enlarged and written notice prior to the commencement of work has been given to the city engineering department and provided that the work is conducted using best management practices to ensure that flow and circulation patterns and chemical and biological characteristics of the wetland are not impaired and that any adverse effect on the aquatic environment will be minimized. 
                  (2)  Temporary water-level stabilization measures associated with ongoing silvicultural operations, provided that they are necessary to alleviate abnormally wet or dry conditions that would have an adverse impact on the conduct of silvicultural activities if not corrected. 
                  (3)  Limited ditching, tilling, dredging, excavating or filling done solely for the purpose of maintaining or repairing existing drainage systems necessary for the cultivation of agricultural crops, provided that the maintenance or repair activity does not result in the impairment, alteration or loss of wetlands not previously subject to agricultural and silvicultural use under the terms and provisions of section 24-75. 
                  (4)  Limited excavating and filling necessary for the repair and maintenance of piers, walkways, nature trails, observation decks, wildlife management shelters, boathouses or other similar water-related structures, provided that they are built on pilings to allow unobstructed flow of water and preserve the natural contour of the wetland.

                  Sec. 24-77. - Site plans. 
                  Applications for a local development permit within the generalized wetland protection district shall include a site plan, drawn at a scale of one (1) inch equals fifty (50) feet, with the following information: 
                  (1)  A map of all planned excavation and fill, including calculations of the volume of cut and fill involved, cross-sectional drawings showing existing and proposed grades. Elevations, horizontal scale and vertical scale must be shown on the cross-sectional drawings. 
                  (2)  A map of any wetland boundaries occurring within the site must be provided. This boundary may be included on other maps provided by the applicant. 
                  (3)  Location, dimensions and area of all impervious surfaces, both existing and proposed, on the site and adjacent to the site for a distance of two hundred (200) feet. 
                  (4)  The orientation and distance from the boundaries of the proposed site to the nearest bank of an affected perennial stream or water body. 
                  (5)  Elevations of the site and adjacent lands within two hundred (200) feet of the site at contour intervals of no greater than two (2) feet; and no greater than one foot for slopes less than or equal to two (2) percent.

                  ARTICLE VII. - SMALL WATERSHED PROTECTION FOR BARBER'S CREEK, CEDAR CREEK, FORT YARGO LAKE AND LAUREL LANE RESERVOIR 

                  Sec. 24-100. - Findings and purpose. 
                  (a)  Findings of fact. In order to provide for the health, safety and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within the city and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be assured. The ability of natural systems to filter stormwater runoff can be threatened by unrestricted development. Land disturbing activities associated with development can increase erosion and sedimentation which threatens the storage capacity of reservoirs. In addition, stormwater runoff, particularly from impervious surfaces, can introduce toxicant, nutrients and sediment into drinking water supplies, making water treatment more complicated and expensive and rendering water resources unusable for recreation. Industrial land uses that involve the manufacture, use, transport and storage of hazardous or toxic waste materials result in the potential risk of contamination of nearby public drinking water supplies. 
                  (b)  Purpose. The purpose of this article is to establish measures to protect the quality and quantity of the present and future water supply of the city; to minimize the transport of pollutants and sediment to the water supply; and to maintain the yield of the water supply watershed. This article shall apply to the portions of the following watersheds that are located within the jurisdiction of the city and are herein identified as water supply watershed: Barber's Creek, Cedar Creek, Fort Yargo Lake and Laurel Lane Reservoir.

The zoning board of appeals agent may authorize, upon appeal in individual cases, variances from the terms of this article as will not be contrary to the public interest. Variances will only be issued in cases where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this article will result in unnecessary hardship. Such variance may be granted in individual cases of practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship only upon a finding by the zoning board of appeals that all of the following conditions exist: 
                  (1)  There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape or topography; 
                  (2)  The application of this article to the particular piece of property would create an unnecessary hardship; 
                  (3)  Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the water quality of the particular body of water and/or impair the purposes and intent of this article; 
                  (4)  The special circumstances surrounding the request for a variance are not the result of acts by the applicant; 
                  (5)  The variance is not a request to permit a use of land, buildings or structures that is not permissible in the district involved; and 
                  (6)  The variance will not result in an increase of the impervious surface of the development beyond that prescribed according to section 24-106. 
                  (b)  Conditions. The zoning board of appeals may, as a condition of the variance to certain provisions of this article, require that alternative measures be taken by the applicant such that the purposes of this article may be achieved through alternative means.

                  Sec. 24-109. - Judicial review. 
                  (a)  Jurisdiction. All final decisions of the zoning board of appeals concerning denial, approval or conditional approval of a special permit shall be reviewable in the county superior court. 
                  (b)  Alternative actions. Based on these proceedings and the decision of the court, the city may, within the time specified by the court, elect to: 
                  (1)  Institute negotiated purchase or condemnation proceedings to acquire an easement or fee interest in the applicant's land; 
                  (2)  Approve the permit application with lesser restrictions or conditions (i.e., grant a variance); or 
                  (3)  Institute other appropriate actions ordered by the court that fall within the jurisdiction of the city.

                  Editor's note— Ord. W-3-18 , adopted July 24, 2018, set out provisions intended for use as §§ 24-201—24-214. To maintain the style of the Code, and at the editor's discretion, they have instead been set out as §§ 24-221—24-234. 

                  Sec. 24-221. - Definitions. 
                  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Customers means all persons, properties, and entities served by and/or benefiting from the stormwater utility's acquisition, management, maintenance, extension, and improvement of the city stormwater management programs and facilities and regulation of other public and private stormwater management programs, facilities and activities related thereto, and persons, properties, and entities that will ultimately be served or benefited as a result of the city stormwater management programs. 
                  Developed land means any parcel or lot that has more than fifty (50) square feet of impervious surface located thereon. 
                  Fiscal year means July 1 of a calendar year to June 30 of the next calendar year. 
                  Hard structures include, but are not limited to, flumes, catch basins, drop inlets, outlet control structures, head walls, junction boxes, culverts, or curb and gutter used to convey stormwater. 
                  Impervious area means the area, usually expressed in square feet, that is covered by an impervious surface. 
                  Impervious surface means areas that prevent or impede the infiltration of stormwater into the soil as it had entered in natural conditions prior to the development. Impervious surfaces include, but are not limited to, rooftops, sidewalks, walkways, patio areas, driveways, parking lots, storage areas, compacted gravel surfaces, awnings and other fabric or plastic coverings, and other surfaces that prevent or impede the natural infiltration of stormwater runoff which existed prior to development.

                  (Ord. ( W-3-18 ) of 7-24-18) 
                  Sec. 24-222. - Findings. 
                  The City of Winder acknowledges the following findings of fact: 
                  (1)  The city is authorized by the Georgia Constitution of 1983, including, without limitation, Article IX, Section II, Paragraphs I and III thereof and O.C.G.A. § 36-82-62 to provide stormwater management services, systems and facilities throughout the corporate boundaries of the city. 
                  (2)  In order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public, the governing authority of the city hereby exercises its authority to establish a stormwater utility enterprise fund and establish rates for stormwater management services. 
                  (3)  In promulgating the regulations contained in this section, the city is acting pursuant to authority granted by the constitution and laws of the State of Georgia and its city Charter to provide for stormwater collection and disposal. 
                  (4)  Improper management of stormwater runoff may cause erosion of lands, threaten businesses and residences, and other facilities with water damage and may environmentally impair the rivers, streams and other bodies of water within the city's service area. 
                  (5)  A system for the collection, conveyance, storage, treatment and disposal of stormwater provides services to all properties within the city's service area and surrounding areas. 
                  (6)  The city presently owns and operates stormwater management programs and facilities, which have been developed over many years. The future usefulness and operational function of the existing stormwater management programs and facilities owned and operated by the city, and the additions and improvements thereto, rests on the ability of the city to effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use, and enhance stormwater systems and facilities within the city in concert with the management of other water resources within the city's service area. In order to do so, the city must have both a comprehensive stormwater management program as well as an adequate and stable funding source for its comprehensive program operation and drainage-related capital improvement needs. 
                  (7)  Failure to effectively manage stormwater can adversely affect the operations of the public sanitary sewer system and private septic systems thereby increasing the likelihood of infiltration and inflow into those systems. 
                  (8)  The cost of operating and maintaining the city's stormwater management program and financing necessary repairs, replacements, improvements and extensions thereof should, to the extent practicable, be allocated in relationship to the services received from the system. 
                  (9)  Given the stormwater management program problems, needs, goals, priorities and funding strategy it is appropriate to authorize the formation of an organizational and accounting entity dedicated specifically to the management, maintenance, protection, control, regulation, use, and enhancement of stormwater management services, systems and facilities within the city's service area in concert with other water resource management programs. 
                  (10)  Stormwater management is applicable and needed throughout the city's service area. While specific service and facility demands may differ from area to area at any given point in time, a stormwater management program and service area encompassing all lands and water bodies within the city's service area is consistent with the present needs of the community. 
                  (11)  The stormwater needs in the city include, but are not limited to, protection of the public health, safety, and welfare of the community. Provision of stormwater management services renders and/or results in both a service and a benefit to all properties, property owners, citizens, and residents of the city in a variety of ways. 
                  (12)  The stormwater management services rendered may differ depending on many factors and considerations, including, but not limited to, location, demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater management programs and risk exposure. It is practical and equitable to allocate the cost of stormwater management among the owners of improved properties in proportion to the long term demands the properties impose on the city's stormwater management services which result in services to such properties and the owners thereof. 
                  (13)  A stormwater management program provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering stormwater management services throughout the city's service area, and the most equitable means to regulate the use of a higher level of stormwater management services within the city's service area through stormwater service fee charges and other mechanisms. 
                  (14)  The area of impervious surfaces on each improved property is the most important factor influencing the cost of the stormwater management services provided by the city or to be provided by the city in the future, and the area of impervious surfaces on each property is therefore the most appropriate parameter for calculating a periodic stormwater service fee charge. 
                  (15)  A schedule of stormwater service fees based in part on the area of impervious surface located on each improved property is the most appropriate and equitable means of allocating the cost of stormwater management services throughout the city's service area. Such stormwater service fees may be complemented by other types of charges which address specific needs, including, but not limited to, special service fees, special assessments, revenue bonds, use of proceeds from special purpose local option sales taxes and other forms of revenue, as deemed appropriate by the mayor and city council. 
                  (16)  It is imperative that the proceeds from all stormwater service fees, together with any other revenues raised or otherwise allocated specifically to stormwater management services, systems or facilities, be dedicated solely to those purposes, and such proceeds of stormwater service fees and revenues shall therefore be deposited into the enterprise accounting fund of the city stormwater utility and shall remain in that fund and be dispersed only for stormwater management capital, operating and non-operating costs, lease payments and debt service of bonds or other indebtedness for stormwater management purposes.

                  Sec. 24-223. - Establishment of a stormwater utility and stormwater enterprise fund. 
                  (a)  There is hereby established a stormwater utility within and under the supervision of the city's department of stormwater management, which stormwater utility shall be responsible for providing stormwater management services, for providing stormwater management programs and related facilities, and for determining labor, material and administrative fees for the operation of the city's stormwater management programs. 
                  (b)  The city stormwater enterprise fund, established in 2018 to fund the operation of the city's stormwater management programs and performance of inspections of and repairs to city stormwater management programs and facilities, is hereby designated as a funding mechanism for the stormwater utility and shall continue to operate as a funding mechanism for the maintenance, repair and construction of city stormwater management programs. 
                  (c)  The city hereby transfers to the stormwater utility responsibility for stormwater services, city stormwater management programs and related facilities, and other related assets, including, but not limited to, properties upon which such facilities are located, and related easements, rights-of-entry and access rights. 
                  (d)  The city finance department shall maintain the stormwater enterprise fund in the city budget and accounting system, separate and apart from its general fund, for the purpose of dedicating and protecting all funding applicable to the purposes and responsibilities of the stormwater utility, including, but not limited to, charges, rates, fees and licenses as may be established from time to time by the mayor and city council. All revenues and receipts of the stormwater utility shall be deposited promptly upon receipt into the stormwater enterprise fund, to be held and invested in trust and expended exclusively for the purposes of the stormwater utility, including but not limited to repayment of loans and capital project construction. No other funds of the city shall be deposited in the stormwater enterprise fund or commingled with dedicated stormwater utility funds, except that other revenues, receipts, and resources not accounted for in the stormwater enterprise fund, including grants, loans, loans from the general fund and bond proceeds, may be combined with and applied to stormwater utility capital projects as deemed appropriate by the mayor and city council, upon recommendation of the stormwater coordinator.

                  Sec. 24-224. - Scope of responsibility for the city stormwater management programs. 
                  (a)  The city stormwater management program consists of all rivers, streams, creeks, branches, lakes, reservoirs, ponds, drainage ways, channels, ditches, swales, storm sewers, culverts, inlets, catch basins, pipes, headwalls, and other structures, natural or manmade, within the city limits of the city, which control or convey stormwater and through which the city intentionally diverts surface waters from its public streets and properties. The city owns or has legal access for purposes of operation, maintenance and improvements to those segments of the stormwater management program that: 
                  (1)  Are located within city streets, rights-of-way or easements; 
                  (2)  Are subject to city easements, rights of entry, rights of access, rights of use, or other permanent rights of the city for adequate access for operation, maintenance and/or improvement of stormwater management programs and facilities; or 
                  (3)  Are located on public lands to which the city has adequate access for operation, maintenance, and/or improvement of stormwater management programs and related facilities. 
                  Operation and maintenance of stormwater management programs and related facilities which are located on private property, or public property not owned by or otherwise accessible pursuant to written property rights to the city, and for which there has been no public dedication of such stormwater management programs and related facilities for operation, maintenance, and/or improvement of such stormwater management programs and related facilities shall be and remain the legal responsibility of the applicable property owner or occupant, except as that responsibility may be otherwise affected by the laws of either the state or federal government. 
                  (b)  It is the intent of this article to protect the public health, safety and general welfare of all properties and persons in the city in general, but not to create any special duty or relationship with any individual person or to any specified property within or without the boundaries of the city. 
                  (c)  If any permit, plan approval, inspection or similar act is required by the city as a condition precedent to any activity or change upon property not owned by the city pursuant to this or any other regulatory ordinance, regulation or rule of the city, or under federal or state law, the issuance of such permit, plan approval or inspection shall not be deemed to constitute a warranty, express or implied, nor shall it afford the basis for any action, including any action based on failure to permit, negligent issuance of a permit, negligent plan approval, or negligent maintenance of any permitted stormwater management program or facility not expressly dedicated to and accepted by the city for further maintenance in an action seeking the imposition of money damages or equitable remedies against the city, its council members, mayor, officers, employees or agents. 
                  (Ord. ( W-3-18 ) of 7-24-18) 
                  Sec. 24-225. - Requirements for commercial and industrial on-site stormwater systems; enforcement methods and inspections. 
                  All owners and developers of developed commercial or industrial parcels within the city developed or constructed after July 24, 2018, and such parcels that have existing stormwater facilities shall provide, manage, maintain, and operate on-site stormwater management programs sufficient to collect, convey, detain, and discharge stormwater in a safe manner consistent with all federal, state, and city regulations. Any failure to meet this obligation shall constitute a nuisance and be subject to an abatement action filed by the city in any court of competent jurisdiction. In the event a public nuisance is found to exist by the court, which nuisance the owner fails to properly abate within such reasonable time as allowed by the court, the city may enter upon the property and cause such remedial work as is reasonably necessary to be performed, with the actual cost thereof assessed against the property owner. From the date of the filing of such action, the city shall have lien rights which may be perfected, after judgment, by filing a notice of lien on the general execution docket of the Superior Court of Barrow County. The city shall have the right, pursuant to the authority of this article, for its designated officers and employees to enter upon private property, upon reasonable notice to the owner thereof, to inspect the property and conduct surveys and engineering tests thereon in order to assure compliance with this section.

                  Sec. 24-226. - Determination and modification of stormwater service fees. 
                  Stormwater service fees shall be based upon an estimate of stormwater runoff from a property and shall be determined and modified from time to time by resolution of the city council. The area of impervious surface on each parcel shall be calculated as of January 1 preceding each fiscal year. In setting or modifying such rates, it shall be the objective of the city to establish rates and fees that are fair and reasonable, which may include flat fee rates for certain classifications of properties, reflect the value of stormwater management services and facilities to those properties that benefit therefrom and which, together with any other sources of revenue that may be made available to the stormwater utility, will be sufficient to meet the cost of budgeted programs, services and facilities including, but not limited to, the payment of principal and interest on revenue bond obligations incurred for construction and improvements to the city stormwater management programs. Future capital investments and necessary reserve accounts, including but not limited to an emergency reserve account, may be included in the calculation of the stormwater service fees.

                  Sec. 24-227. - Effective date of stormwater service fees. 
                  (a)  An annual service charge is imposed upon each parcel of developed land in the city as of July 1 each fiscal year, effective July 1, 2018, to fund stormwater utility programs. This annual service charge shall be known as the "stormwater service fee." Stormwater service fees shall be maintained in the stormwater enterprise fund by the city. Purchases by the stormwater utility shall be made through the Stormwater Management program for the sole purpose of performing the obligations of the stormwater utility. 
                  (b)  Stormwater service fees supporting stormwater utility needs will be determined for each fiscal year and will be approved by resolution during the budgeting process by the city. 
                  (Ord. ( W-3-18 ) of 7-24-18) 
                  Sec. 24-228. - Stormwater service fee billing, delinquencies, collections. 
                  (a)  A stormwater service fee bill shall be attached to and/or included in the annual property tax bill generated by the county tax commissioner. The stormwater service fee is due as stated on said bill as well as past due late charges. Failure to receive a bill is not justification for nonpayment. Regardless of the party to whom the bill is initially directed, the owner of each parcel of developed land, as shown from public land records of the county, shall be ultimately obligated to pay the stormwater service fee. If a customer is under-billed or if no bill is sent for developed land, the city may back-bill for a period of up to four (4) years, but shall not assess penalties, other than the late charge for delinquency as described in this section. The inclusion of the stormwater service fees with the annual tax bill is intended for convenience only, such stormwater service fee are fees for utility services provided to customers by the stormwater utility and are not a tax or regulatory fee. 
                  (b)  The city reserves the right to place stormwater service fees on utility bills in lieu of a tax bill or when a tax bill on a property is not a feasible option to collect the stormwater service fees on a property. 
                  (c)  Suits for collection of unpaid stormwater service fees shall be filed in a court of competent jurisdiction. No lien shall be imposed for delinquent collections unless a judgment is first obtained. 
                  (d)  Unpaid stormwater service fees may be collected by filing suit to collect on an unpaid account and by using all methods allowed by state law to collect on any judgment obtained thereby. 
                  (e)  A late charge of ten (10) percent of the amount due per year shall be assessed against the customer for the unpaid balance of any stormwater service fee that becomes delinquent. In addition, the city shall assess all costs of collection, including attorney's fees and court costs, against the property owner. 
                  (Ord. ( W-3-18 ) of 7-24-18) 
                  Sec. 24-229. - Requests for modification of the stormwater service fee. 
                  (a)  Any property owner may request a review and adjustment of their stormwater service fee by submitting a request in writing, along with any supporting information, to the stormwater coordinator within thirty (30) days after the date the tax bill is mailed or issued to the property owner. Grounds for modification of the stormwater service fee include, complete demolition and removal of all impervious surfaces on the parcel in question making up greater than fifty (50) square feet of impervious surface area subject to documentation and city personnel inspection. The filing of a request for review does not excuse payment of the fee when due. 
                  (b)  The stormwater coordinator shall administer the procedures and standards for the adjustment of the stormwater service fee charge as approved by the city. 
                  (c)  Reserved. 
                  (d)  Customers requesting the adjustment shall be required, at their own expense, to provide supplemental information at the request of the stormwater coordinator including, but not limited to, an "as-built" survey certified by a registered land surveyor or a professional engineer if the stormwater coordinator cannot make a determination based on field inspection and/or review of existing city aerial photography. Failure to provide the required information within the time limits established by the stormwater coordinator, as may be reasonably extended, may result in denial of the adjustment request. 
                  (e)  Once a completed adjustment request and all required information are received by the stormwater coordinator, the city shall have thirty (30) calendar days within which to render a written decision. If the city fails to render a decision within thirty (30) days, the adjustment request shall automatically be deemed denied, but said denial shall be subject to appeal to the zoning board of appeals. Appeals shall be filed with the zoning board of appeals within thirty (30) days of the denial in accordance with section 24-214. 
                  (f)  In considering an adjustment request, the city shall consider whether the calculation of the stormwater service fee for the property is correct. 
                  (g)  The stormwater coordinator decision shall be in writing and will be mailed to the address provided on the adjustment request, and service shall be complete upon mailing. 
                  (h)  If the result of an adjustment is that a refund is due the applicant, the refund will be paid within forty-five (45) days.

                  (b)  Applicants must apply for any credits or adjustments that they believe apply. 
                  (c)  The application for any credit or adjustment must be in writing and must include the information necessary to establish eligibility for the credit or adjustment, any application fee, and be in the format established by the stormwater coordinator. Incomplete applications will not be accepted by the city. 
                  (d)  Applicants that have on-site detention or retention must have an approved maintenance plan on file with the stormwater coordinator. 
                  (e)  Applicants that have on-site detention or retention must have a licensed engineer provide documentation that the detention/retention area meets applicable code. 
                  (f)  When an application for a credit is deemed complete, the stormwater coordinator shall have thirty (30) days from the date the complete application is accepted to grant or deny the credit by written decision. Failure to render a decision within thirty (30) calendar days shall be deemed a denial.

                  Sec. 180.2. - Purpose. 
                  The purpose and intent of a TNPD zone is to allow, coordinate and regulate comprehensive developments which may not follow standard design practices otherwise allowed by the city's zoning regulations.

                  Sec. 180.3. - Procedures and regulations. 
                  Traditional Neighborhood Planned Developments (TNPD) will sometimes involve mixed uses, varying densities, grouping of housing and/or open spaces and may have densities and setbacks that are non-conventional in developments of the type being sought by the developer of a TNPD. Each applicant seeking a TNPD approval must indicate the applicant's understanding and willingness to adhere to the various procedures and regulations applicable to TNPD developments. Also, the applicant must be aware that to enable thorough analysis of a TNPD, more information is required about the proposal than would normally be needed if the development was to be pursued under conventional zoning requirements. Prior to submittal, it is required that a pre-submittal conference be conducted with the developer or his authorized representative and the appropriate City of Winder staff. In some instances, more than one (1) pre-submittal conference maybe required. The City of Winder staff reserves the right to take up to three (3) weeks to review information presented at the pre-submittal conference(s).

                  a)  Ownership; sale or transfer: None of the land may be sold or otherwise transferred by lease, deed, encumbrance or otherwise until the applicant has recorded the final plat with the Barrow County Clerk of Courts office in the form approved by the City of Winder and that the overall tract of land described therein is a portion of a Traditional Neighborhood Planned Development (TNPD) that will result in substantial perpetual restrictions on the future use of the property encompassed therein including; (a) designating portions thereof as open areas for no other use other than as open areas and (b) prohibiting the redevelopment of any area of the TNPD at a density greater than that assigned to the area of the TNPD at the time of final approval of the development plan (including density) for that area; provided however, the foregoing provisions shall not prohibit the same owner of more than one (1) area of a TNPD from reassigning density rights between two (2) or more areas of a TNPD as long as such reassignment is reviewed by the planning board and approved by the city council and does not increase the overall density of the TNPD and is otherwise consistent with the overall development plan. 
                  b)  Conditions for preliminary approval: In considering the preliminary approval for the rezoning of property to a TNPD zone, the planning board shall consider the following and give a preliminary recommendation only upon satisfaction of the following conditions: 
                  1)  The proposal will utilize design and development standards which would not be permitted in any other zoning district or which would combine various types of uses of housing into a single district.

                  6)  The proposal makes adequate provisions for community facilities such as water, sewer, recreation and open areas. Seventy (70) per cent of the proposed recreation and open areas within the proposed TNPD land area must be outside of all flood hazard areas as defined by the appropriate flood insurance rate map for the City of Winder. Open areas must be free from impervious surfaces. Landscape areas: Within a TNPD the minimum per centage of landscaped/open space required for each portion of the development is as follows:

Parking areas shall be to the side or rear of the buildings they serve. On-lot parking only will be allowed, no on-street parking will be allowed. Other parking requirements necessary will be required to meet or exceed current City of Winder ordinances. 
                  10)  The developer shows the proposed schedule of phases of development. 
                  11)  The developer presents the proposed utility corridor(s), for all phases of the TNPD development, and the City of Winder has to agree with and approve all utility corridors. 
                  12)  Private streets may be allowed provided the specifications for such streets are reviewed and approved by the City of Winder. 
                  13)  Proper design: It is encouraged that the layout of the TNPD development, as a whole, utilize the natural topography of the site, take advantage of existing trees and any historical features on the property. The design of the TNPD must provide for an orderly and creative arrangement of land uses that are harmonious and beneficial to the City of Winder. 
                  14)  The developer provides detailed drawings showing what is proposed to buffer the development site from adjacent properties. 
                  15)  The developer presents guidelines for the physical development of the property including illustrations of proposed architectural, landscape, open space, signage and other hardscape concepts. 
                  c)  Minimum size: The minimum area that will qualify for a TNPD zone will be ten (10) acres; provided, however, smaller tracts of land contiguous to an existing TNPD zone may be rezoned TNPD if same are an expansion of the existing adjacent TNPD or used fot infill adjacent to or within the First Fire District as defined in section 5-22 of the City of Winder Code of Ordinances. 
                  d)  Permitted uses: The TNPD zone is planned to be primarily a single-family residential zone with small per centages of the total land areas contained within a TNPD being available for use for multifamily residential, professional and commercial. In order to ensure that limited uses and overall densities for a TNPD are not violated, the following express limitations must be satisfied in each phase of the TNPD approval and development process: 
                  1)  The maximum area of a TNPD to be developed or allotted for development as multifamily residential, single-family residential, professional or commercial cannot exceed the following per centages of the entire property. 
                  2)  The maximum area of a TNPD to be developed or allotted for development as multifamily cannot exceed five (5) per cent of the total TNPD. The density of the multifamily shall not exceed eight (8) units per acre, however, the maximum density per acre within the multifamily portion of the TNPD may be increased up to fifteen (15) units per acre if the multifamily area has designated open areas adjacent to same at least twenty-five (25) per cent as large as the multifamily area. No multifamily development within a TNPD may be contiguous to any property outside of the TNPD that is in a R-1, R-1A or R-1B zone. 
                  3)  Any use permitted in the R-1 single-family residential zone, see article VI, (but subject to the same conditions as the aforesaid section, except lot size, building size and setbacks) shall be permitted anywhere in the TNPD except those areas previously set aside as open areas. 
                  4)  Open areas shall be disbursed throughout the TNPD developments so the open areas are readily available to the various developments within the TNPD. Open areas may be in the form of open fields or wooded areas, ballparks, golf courses, recreational fields and other recreational uses permitted by the planning board and city council. All common open space shall be preserved for the purpose as shown on the developments master plan. The developer shall choose one (1) or a combination of the following three (3) methods of administering the common open spaces. 
                  i)  Dedication of the common open space to the City of Winder, which is subject to formal acceptance and available revenue sources to maintain the space. 
                  ii)  Establishment of an association or non-profit corporation of all property owners or corporations within the project area to ensure perpetual maintenance of all common open space. 
                  iii)  Retention of ownership, control and maintenance of all common open spaces by the developer. All privately owned common open space shall continue as such and shall only be used in accordance with the developments master plan. Appropriate land use restrictions shall be contained in all deeds to insure that the common open space is permanently preserved according to the developments master plan. Said deed restrictions shall run with the land and be for the benefit of present as well as future property owners, and shall contain a prohibition against partition of common open space. 
                  5)  Except as hereinafter provided, height limitations, minimum lot area, setbacks (front, side and rear yard) and minimum building size shall be established by the City of Winder staff and are to be approved in conjunction with the final approval for each area of development within the TNPD. All buildings constructed within a TNPD shall have a minimum fifty-foot setback from all exterior boundary lines except where like uses are present. 
                  e)  Density: Unless increased by approval of the mayor and city council as part of the general approval of special criteria, the gross density for a TNPD shall not exceed five (5) residential units per net acre contained within the TNPD. 
                  Net acreage means the gross area within the TNPD's exterior boundaries inclusive of streets, roads and other right-of-ways, but less the maximum area planned for either professional or commercial developments and less portions of the areas designated as open areas that exceed the permitted limitations on building areas and impervious surface areas (such as parking lots) contained in subsection 1.4, d) 4) above. 
                  f)  Application of other city ordinances: Unless specifically waived by the mayor and city council as a part of its general approval of special criteria for the TNPD, each development within the TNPD shall comply with all other city ordinances and regulations contained within the City of Winder's Code of Ordinances, including, but not limited to, parking requirements, utilities specifications, wetlands, floodplains, soil erosion, issuance of permits, inspections, the Georgia State Energy Code, all standard building and other codes, electric codes, fire codes, fire walls and petitions, development reviews, and other code provisions or regulations that are normally applicable to the development of property within the City of Winder. 
                  g)  Since the primary intended use of land areas within a TNPD is single-family residential, any area of a TNPD may be platted and subdivided in accordance with the city's subdivision regulations as though they were in the R-1 use district unless such subdivision would result in exceeding the overall density requirements of the TNPD.

                  The approval process: The process to secure the approvals and zoning for development of property as a Traditional Neighborhood Planned Development (TNPD) will involve the following steps. 
                  Step #1: As stated in section 1.3, at the least one pre-submittal conference will be required. The pre-submittal conference is between the developer and the appropriate City of Winder staff, this preliminary meeting is held to try and develop a more completed plan before it is submitted to the planning board. At the pre-submittal conference, the concept of the proposed TNPD will be discussed in detail. Preliminary plans and other pertinent documents can be submitted to the city for preliminary review and comment at this time. The City of Winder reserves the right to take up to three (3) weeks to review information presented at the pre-submittal conference(s). 
                  Step #2: Once the City of Winder staffis satisfied that the applicant's proposed TNPD project meets or exceeds all applicable articles and chapters of the city's Code of Ordinances and is ready for submission to the planning board, the director of planning will submit the application and plans to the planning board for consideration. The information required for submittal to the planning board is to include, but not limited to the following: 
                  (a)  The density, lot size and setback requirements that apply to each phase of the development, including in particular, any special situations or criteria. Each phase of the development must also list the maximum number of residences to be constructed. 
                  (b)  The maximum area to be developed as multifamily residential, the maximum area to be developed as residential, professional or commercial. 
                  (c)  The exact acreage contained in the applicant's requested TNPD development as shown on a plat survey by a licensed surveyor or engineer. 
                  (d)  The minimum area of open space to be dedicated. 
                  (e)  If the development contemplated by the application has a proposed density greater than the maximum overall density per acre within the TNPD, the applicant shall have designated and dedicated sufficient open areas so as to ensure that the overall approved density within the TNPD will not be exceeded if developed to its full potential. Open areas to be "dedicated" shall mean the official designation in the deed records of Barrow County, Georgia of a land area by plat dedication with metes and bounds of an area described as an open area in a TNPD under the City of Winder TNPD regulations in a form acceptable to the City of Winder attorney. 
                  (f)  The developer shall submit the final restrictive covenants and/or easements for the area encompassed by the plan under consideration as an integral part of the application. The covenants must require language that allows the City of Winder to enforce said covenants at the discretion of the city. 
                  (g)  Signs: Unless other sign regulations are approved or deemed required by the City of Winder as apart of the general approval of special criteria, the city's sign regulations shall apply to the specified areas of the TNPD. 
                  (h)  Refer to the preliminary plan submittal section for landscape requirements. 
                  (i)  All utility corridors are to be approved by the City of Winder. 
                  (j)  Maintenance bond requirements, see section 28-40 of the City of Winder Code of Ordinances. 
                  (k)  TNPD projects must adhere to all City of Winder subdivision and development regulations unless specifically allowed otherwise. 
                  Since approval of a TNPD constitutes a rezoning of a property, a public hearing shall be conducted in accordance with Article 22 (Zoning Changes and Ordinance Amendments) of the City of Winder Code of Ordinances. The public hearing is held to review and consider the application, the applicant's preliminary site plan, and a draft of the regulations concerning the applicant's proposed TNPD. If the Planning Board determines that the application is complete and consistent with the City of Winder's future land use goals and provisions of Article 28 (Subdivisions) of the City of Winder Code of Ordinances it shall pass along the application and plans to the city council for final approval. 
                  In the case of denial of the application by the planning board, the applicant shall be entitled to gather further information or change his proposed concept to better suit the requirements of the planning board and come back before the planning board for consideration again. 
                  Step #3: Final approval shall arise only after the developer has submitted all the required information pertaining to the proposed TNPD project to the planning board and the planning board has reviewed all proposed plans, densities, setbacks and covenants, etc., then the planning board will make a recommendation for consideration by the city council. 
                  After receiving a recommendation from the planning board, the mayor and city council shall either reject the application, and stating the reasons, or remand the application to the planning board for further consideration and recommendations thereon in light of the comments being developed at the public hearing, or grant approval. The mayor and city council can either approve or reject the application in whole or in part and specify the reasons. Granting approval shall have the legal effect of changing the property from the then existing zoning district to the TNPD district. The mayor and city council may require additional public hearings as deemed necessary. 
                  The City of Winder shall maintain such information as necessary to ensure that each portion of the TNPD development complies with the provisions of this section. Such information shall include a detailed listing of total areas within the TNPD, the maximum amount of multifamily residential development, the maximum amount of residential, professional or commercial development, the maximum number of residential units permitted within the TNPD, the maximum number of residential units per acre to be constructed in areas of the TNPD, other than multifamily, the number of acres to be dedicated to open space and a running total of final approvals given and areas thereby committed to specified densities and uses. 
                  Modifications: After securing the appropriate final approval by the mayor and city council for a development within a TNPD, all developments on that portion must be done according to the plans approved and no adjustments or alterations shall be made without prior approval of each reviewing body that was required to give such approval. If major changes are proposed, a new public hearing shall be required before approval of the final plat.

                  ( Ord. (W-6-15) of 9-15-15 ) 
                  Sec. 230.2. - Purpose and findings. 
                  A.  Purpose. This article was enacted with the following purposes: 
                  1.  To protect the rights of individuals and businesses to convey their messages through signs; 
                  2.  To encourage the effective use of signs as a means of communication; 
                  3.  To promote economic development; 
                  4.  To improve traffic and pedestrian safety as it may be affected by distracting signs; 
                  5.  To prevent the destruction of the natural beauty and environment of the city and to ensure the harmony and compatibility of the character of the area including its physical appearance, natural setting, informal landscaping, and preserve the historic character of the city; 
                  6.  To encourage and ensure that development that is contemporary in design and materials compliments and is compatible and sensitive with the existing character of the area through its proportion, scale, design, style, placement, position, and architectural qualities; 
                  7.  To protect the public health, safety, and general welfare; 
                  8.  To restrict the continued existence of abandoned or nonconforming signs unless in compliance with the terms of this article and to eliminate, over time, all nonconforming signs; 
                  9.  To ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign standards; and 
                  10.  To make it easier, quicker, and more economically efficient to apply for a sign permit. 
                  B.  Findings. 
                  1.  The city finds that signs are a proper use of private property, are a means of personal free expression and a necessary component of a commercial environment. As such, signs are entitled to the protection of the law. In the absence of regulation, however, the number of such signs tends to proliferate, with property owners desiring ever increasing numbers and sizes of signs, leading to cluttered and aesthetically blighted thoroughfares. In addition, the competition among competing sign owners for visibility of their signs contributes to safety hazards for both vehicles and pedestrians and undermines the sign owners' original purpose of presenting a clear message of its idea or identification of its premises. 
                  2.  The city further finds that the regulation of the size, height, number and spacing of signs is necessary to protect the public safety, to assure compatibility of signs with surrounding land uses, to enhance the business and economy of the city, to protect the public investment in the streets and highways, to maintain the tranquil environment of residential areas, to promote industry and commerce, to eliminate visual clutter and blight, to provide an aesthetically appealing environment, and to provide for the orderly and reasonable display of advertising for the benefit of all the city's citizens. 
                  3.  The city further finds that there is a substantial difference between signs erected by public authority and signs erected by private citizens or businesses. signs erected by public authority are virtually all erected for the purpose of maintaining the public safety either through direct control of traffic or through provision of such type signage as street signs which enable the traveling public to know where they are located and to find where they are going. As such, with the exception of signs identifying government buildings, virtually all government signs are erected purely for public safety purposes. Moreover, their use in the public right-of-way is necessary to ensure their visibility to the motoring public. The city council finds that public utility signs are frequently of the same nature as those signs erected by governmental entities in that they provide necessary information to safeguard the public from downed power lines and from street excavations. Even where signs serve a propriety purpose, such as identifying markings on utility poles, those signs are marked primarily for the purpose of benefiting the public generally through identification of locations where there may be temporary losses of power. 
                  4.  The city further finds that some signage has a single targeted function and that identification of such signage by description is impossible without referring to its function. For instance, address numerals are used for the sole purpose of locating addresses, which is of benefit to persons looking for those addresses and is essential to public safety personnel responding to emergencies. Subdivision signs at the entrances to subdivisions favor a similar purpose in enabling both the traveling public and emergency personnel to quickly locate subdivision entrances for the purpose of either visitation or responding to emergency calls. While such signage is referenced based upon the function it serves within the context of this ordinance, the bulk of the provisions of this chapter are unrelated to the content of the speech provided and allow maximum expressive potential to sign owners.

                  A.  The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the base of the sign structure at normal grade to the top of the highest attached component of the sign. Normal grade shall be construed to be the lower of: (1) existing grade prior to construction or (2) the newly established grade after construction, exclusive of any filling, berming, mounding, or excavating solely for the purpose of locating the sign. In cases in which the normal grade cannot reasonably be determined, sign height shall be computed on the assumption that the elevation of the normal grade at the base of the sign is equal to the elevation of the crown of the nearest public street or the grade of the land at the principal entrance to the principal structure on the lot, whichever is higher. Where the normal grade is below the normal grade of the nearest public street, the sign height shall be calculated from the elevation of the normal grade of the closest public street to the highest point of the sign (surveyor's certificate required).

                  B.  Faces. The face of signs shall be flat, with protrusions of no more than two (2) inches to allow for the texture of the sign and words, letters, figures, symbols, logos, fixtures, colors, or other design elements. No sign or other advertising structure shall be constructed so as to have nails, tacks, or wires protruding therefrom.

Re-inspection and recalibration shall be annually required by the city, in its reasonable discretion, at the permitee's expense to ensure that the specified brightness levels are maintained at all times. 
                  D.  Setbacks. Setbacks shall be measured from the nearest point of the sign closest to the applicable right-of-way or property line. 
                  E.  Landscaping. Landscaping and grass shall be maintained in front of, behind, underneath, and around the base of freestanding signs.

A freestanding billboard shall be maintained so as to assure proper alignment of structure, continued structural soundness and continued readability of message. All freestanding billboards shall submit a wind-load resistance plan. 
                  K.  Removal: Non-conforming billboards and billboard structures shall be removed or repaired within thirty (30) days of notification by the city at the owner's or lessor's expense under the following circumstances: The billboard becomes damaged or dilapidated to the extent that repairs would cost fifty (50) percent or more of its economic value as determined by the planning director.

                  To ensure that freestanding billlboard signs are erected and maintained in a safe and aesthetic manner, it shall be unlawful for any such sign designed to be visible from any public street or highway within the jurisdiction of the City of Winder to be erected or maintained by any person, other than by a sign contractor properly licensed or by a designated representative of such licensed contractor or general contractor, except that this requirement shall be interpreted to exclude those persons who construct and erect a principal use identification sign when said sign is used at said person's place of business provided, however, in all cases, all erection must be properly permitted and inspected for compliance with the applicable codes of the State of Georgia and the City of Winder and this article. 
                  The following maintenance requirements must be observed for all freestanding billboard signs visible from any public street or highway within the city.

                  5.  If a sign or sign structure is damaged due to factors other than vandalism or other criminal or tortious acts such that more than fifty (50) percent of the value is lost, with such determination made by the planning director, any repair or replacement must be done in conformance with this article. If a sign or sign structure is damaged due to vandalism or other criminal or tortious acts, it may be repaired or replaced, regardless of cost, but must be repaired or replaced as previously permitted or if no permit exists, it must be repaired or replaced to the same specifications to which and with the same materials of which the sign was constructed immediately prior to the act which caused the damage. 
                  The planning director or designee may inspect all signs for compliance with these maintenance requirements.
