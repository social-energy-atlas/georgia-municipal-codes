PREFACE 
</p>
        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the ordinances of the city of a general and permanent nature. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1972 Code, as supplemented through September 18, 1978, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the Mayor and Council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the Comparative Tables appearing in the back of this volume, the reader can locate any section of the 1972 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state laws have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this volume. 
Numbering System 
The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the tenth section of Chapter 5 is 5-10. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between Sections 3-8 and 3-9 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 3-8.1, 3-8.2 and 3-8.3, respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 6 and 7, it will be designated as Chapter 6.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Indices 
The indices have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within each index which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. Each such amendment, when incorporated into this Code, may be cited as a part hereof. 
The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
The publication of this Code was under the direct supervision of B. Meade White, Supervising Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publishers are most grateful to Mr. Herman Hill, the former City Manager, and Roy E. Barnes, City Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this Code. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publishers have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the City readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the City's affairs. 
MUNICIPAL CODE CORPORATION  Tallahassee, Florida 
SUPPLEMENT HISTORY TABLE 
The table below allows users of this Code to quickly and accurately determine what ordinances have been considered for codification in each supplement. Ordinances that are of a general and permanent nature are codified in the Code Book and are considered "Included." Ordinances that are not of a general and permanent nature are not codified in the Code Book and are considered "Omitted." 
By adding to this table with each supplement, users of this Code of Ordinances will be able to gain a more complete picture of the Code's historical evolution.

Upon petition to the superior court, such order may be enforced in the same manner as a court judgment by the sheriffs of this state, including levy against the personal property, but such order shall not be deemed to be a court judgment except for enforcement purposes. After three (3) months from the filing of any such lien which remains unpaid, the enforcement board may request the city attorney to foreclose on the lien.

                  (2)  Notice by publication may run concurrently with, or may follow, an attempt or attempts to provide notice by hand delivery, mail, or statutory overnight delivery as required under subsection (a) above. Evidence that an attempt has been made to deliver notice by hand, mail, or statutory overnight delivery as provided in subsection (a) above, together with proof of publication as provided in this subsection, shall be sufficient to show that the notice requirements of this section have been met, without regard to whether or not the alleged violator actually received such notice.

                  (b)  Enterprise zones. 
                  (1)  Purposes. This section, including its subsections, has been enacted based upon a recognized need for revitalization in geographic areas within the city that are suffering or may suffer from disinvestment, underdevelopment, and economic decline and is intended to provide encouragement and incentives to private businesses to reinvest, renovate, restore, improve and rehabilitate such areas for new housing construction and the economic viability and profitability of businesses and commerce and to generate increased employment opportunities for residents of such areas. 
                  (2)  Qualifying business or service enterprise. A qualifying business or service enterprise is an enterprise which increased employment by five (5) or more new full-time job equivalents in a designated enterprise zone and which provides additional economic stimulus in such zone. The quality and quantity of such additional economic stimulus shall be determined, on a case-by-case basis, by the mayor and council. Such business or service enterprise may be new, an expansion or reinvestment of an existing business or service enterprise, or a successor to such business or service enterprise. Whenever possible, ten (10) percent of such new employees shall be low-income or moderate-income individuals, as defined under the Act. 
                  (3)  Designation of enterprise zones. The mayor and council may designate one (1) or more geographic areas as enterprise zones following an analysis of criteria (i.e., pervasive poverty, unemployment, general distress, underdevelopment, general blight) and data described in the Act. A joint resolution by Cobb County and the City of Powder Springs, which may also include one (1) or more other municipalities, may provide such exemptions for jointly designated enterprise zones.

                  1.  One hundred (100) percent of the property taxes shall be exempt for the first five (5) years;

                  d.  In no event shall the value of the property tax exemptions granted to qualifying business and service enterprises within an enterprise zone created by the city exceed ten (10) percent of the value of the property tax digest of the city. In no event shall the value of the property tax exemptions granted to qualifying business and service enterprises within an enterprise zone created by the county, city and one (1) or more municipalities exceed ten (10) percent of the value of the property tax digest of the county and municipality/municipalities that created the enterprise zone. 
                  e.  For any qualifying business or service enterprise, the tax exemption described in this section may begin in any year during which an enterprise zone designation is in effect and may continue even if the enterprise zone designation has terminated. A minimum of five (5) new jobs must be maintained throughout the exemption period for a qualifying business or service enterprise to maintain eligibility for the tax exemption. Property tax exemptions granted to business or service enterprises that continue to qualify for the exemption shall continue for the full term of the incentives. 
                  f.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the city may enter into agreements with qualifying business or service enterprises in designated enterprise zones to provide for modification or termination of any tax and fee exemptions and abatements. 
                  g.  Qualifying business or service enterprises in designated enterprise zones may be eligible for incentives other than those provided under this section, including economic development incentives described elsewhere in this Code, and including fee abatements or reductions for occupation taxes, regulatory fees and business inspections. 
                  (5)  Time limitations. An area designated as an enterprise zone shall remain in existence for ten (10) years from the first day of the calendar year immediately following its designation as an enterprise zone. Except as otherwise provided, property tax incentives granted to a qualified business or service enterprise shall remain in effect for the full term of the exemption period. 
                  (6)  Reporting. The city shall report designations of enterprise zones as required by the Act, providing sufficient information to identify at a minimum the geographic boundaries of enterprise zones, the specific fees and taxes to be exempted or abated, and the beginning and ending dates of the designation period.

                  The purpose of this policy is to set requirements and standards for the City of Powder Springs Procurement Card Program. The policy is intended to comply with current State of Georgia program[s], Georgia statutes and establish more efficient guidelines for elected officials and other city employees using the procurement cards. This policy also pertains to any other government-issued credit cards, including gas and travel cards. 
                  At no time should a city-issued procurement card be used for personal purchases regardless of the circumstances. Utilizing the procurement card for personal use or for the purchase of any good or services not directly related to job responsibilities or other official city business may result in disciplinary action including, but not limited to, termination and/or felony criminal prosecution. All purchases made using a government procurement card must be in accordance with these guidelines, with state law and with the State Procurement Card program policies.

                  This procurement card policy applies to the use of government procurement cards used by elected officials and city employees for purchasing. The city administers cards through the State Procurement Card program and all rules and guidelines of this program apply. The mayor, city council, and employees approved by the card administrator are authorized by the governing authority of the city to use such government purchasing cards or government credit cards and must abide by all of the applicable state laws and this purchasing card policy.

                  In accordance with O.C.G.A. § 36-80-24(b) any documents related to purchases using government procurement cards incurred by elected officials shall be available for public inspection.

                  Monthly card credit limits shall not exceed the maximum established by the municipal governing authority and administered by the authority given to the card program administrators. Subject to the budget, the established single transaction limit for each card must no more than two thousand four hundred ninety-nine dollars and ninety-nine cents ($2,499.99). The established monthly card limit shall not exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) per month per cardholder, if within budget. Any permanent changes to the standardized limits must have express written approval by the card program administrator and must be added to this policy by amendment or addendum. Exceptions to the policy for single purchases shall be made on a case-by-case basis following approval by the card program administrator.

                  An initial "Warning Notification" will be issued to user-departments for any of the following three violations: 
                  • Purchase of goods and services listed as "Unauthorized Purchases."

                  A second occurrence of any of the above infractions shall result in the automatic 30-day suspension of all the individual cardholder's procurement card privileges. 
                  A third occurrence shall result in the permanent suspension of the individual's procurement card privileges and revocation/removal of the card from the individual's possession. That card will then be canceled to prevent usage without the presence of the actual card.

                  (a)  It shall be unlawful for any person to sell or offer for sale at wholesale or retail any alcoholic beverages without having first complied with the provisions of this chapter.

                  (a)  Alleged violations of this chapter may be cited to any court as provided by law and ordinance. Convictions under this chapter shall be punishable in the municipal court by a fine not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or imprisonment for sixty (60) days, or both. Convictions may be considered due cause for suspension or revocation of any license by the governing authority. 
                  (b)  The governing authority may and normally shall take administrative action under this chapter independent of court citations or the lack thereof, and independent of the disposition or lack of disposition thereof. 
                  (c)  The intent of the table below is to be a guide for the governing authority in providing for fair and consistent procedures and possible penalties for alleged violations of this chapter. The authority to deviate from this guide, including but not limited to provisions regarding show cause hearings, computation of number of offenses, time periods, and penalties, is expressly reserved to the governing authority, as is the authority to consider mitigating circumstances in deciding upon possible penalties. The table calls for increased sanctions per increased violations or per increased class or seriousness; thus, among classes, a third offense under the least serious class III triggers sanctions that are reached on a second offense in the more serious class II or on a first offense in the most serious class I; and within the same class, sanctions increase as the number of violations increase. The table reflects a willingness to give a licensee the benefit of the doubt, with respect to administrative action, for an initial offense on the part of the licensee or the employee of the licensee, but to be less willing to do so upon subsequent violations. The table assumes routine enforcement efforts on the part of law enforcement officers. 
                  Table To Be Used As A Guide For Possible Penalties At Show Cause Hearings 

                   
                  1 Number of offenses are to be tallied over a five-year period through and preceding the date of the most recent alleged violation. 
                  City officials shall keep a list of offenses on record for each licensee. "Fifth" offenses applies to fourth or more offenses. 
                  Offenses in one (1) class shall not be counted towards the number of offenses in a different class. 
                  2 Suspensions should not be redeemable through payment of a fine or buy-out provision. Length of suspension should be based on mitigating factors as determined by governing authority. 
                  3 Probation should be for possible subsequent violations in that class only. 
                  (d)  In addition to the penalties provided herein for violation of this chapter, a licensee may be required, at his own expense, to repeat a responsible alcohol sales and service training course, at the discretion of the mayor and city council.

Not less than three (3) nor more than twenty (20) days' notice of such hearing shall be deemed reasonable notice. However, shorter or longer periods shall be authorized as the mayor and council determine that the circumstances justify. Upon application in writing by the license holder, any witness or any party at interest, showing good cause and not for purposes of delay only, the hearing date may be advanced or continued, in which event no further notice shall be required in writing.

                  (a)  An application for variance may be initiated by the owner of a majority interest in the property affected, or the authorized representative. 
                  (b)  All applications shall be submitted to the office of the city manager or his/her designated department on the city's application forms.

                  (h)  An application shall include such descriptions, maps, drawings or other information as needed to clearly illustrate or explain the action requested. The city manager or his/her designee may request such additional information from the applicant as necessary to provide a full understanding of the variance application. 
                  (i)  Once the record has been assembled, the city manager or his/her designee shall schedule the variance application for consideration at the next meeting of the mayor and city council for which adequate public notice can be given. 
                  (j)  At least fifteen (15) days but not more than forty-five (45) days prior to each public hearing, notice shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation within the city. The notice shall state the time, place and purpose of the hearing.

Said signs shall remain posted until a final decision by the city has been rendered. It is the responsibility of the applicant to post the signs and to maintain the signs during the posting period. Failure to post and maintain the signs continuously may prohibit consideration of the variance application at any scheduled public hearing. In the event the signs are not posted continuously, the city, in its sole discretion, may require the reposting and readvertising prior to any future public hearing, for which the applicant shall pay an additional readvertising fee. The city may also in its sole discretion, continue, hold, approve, or dismiss the application. Any dismissal under the provisions of this paragraph shall be with prejudice unless specifically noted as being without prejudice by the city. 
                  (l)  An affidavit by the applicant shall be submitted to the city manager or his/her designee that notice has been given to surrounding property owners as a convenience, as follows:

The written notice is to be mailed by "certified mail—return receipt requested" to the property owners as such names and addresses appear on the county's current ad valorem tax records. 
                  (2)  The applicant shall submit an affidavit with a copy of the notice to the city manager or his/her designee no less than fifteen (15) days prior to the first public hearing, listing the property owners and certifying the date that the notices were mailed. 
                  (3)  The notice is to state the time, place and purpose of the hearing. 
                  (m)  Any applicant wishing to withdraw an application prior to the public hearing of the mayor and city council shall file a written request for such withdrawal with the city manager or his/her designee. The application shall thereupon be removed from the agenda and the request shall have no further effect. 
                  (n)  Work sessions of the mayor and council may be convened from time-to-time to discuss pending matters prior to public hearings. Work sessions at which variance applications are to be discussed shall be attended by the applicant or representative thereof with authority to make binding commitments to the city with respect to any stipulations that may be offered in connection with such application. Failure to attend the work session shall result in the application being tabled one time. Failure to attend the rescheduled work session shall result in denial of the application. The requirements of this subsection may be waived by the mayor and city council, as the case might be, upon good cause shown. 
                  (o)  The public hearing will be convened at the scheduled time and place by the mayor or an appointed designee, as appropriate, who will act as the presiding official. The presiding official may administer oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses by subpoena. The city manager or his/her designee shall submit the assembled record of the application. The city manager or his/her designee, or other appropriate party if the application was taken from an administrative action or interpretation, shall provide such information or explanation as appropriate to the circumstances of the application. 
                  (p)  The public hearing shall be attended by the applicant or representative thereof with authority to make binding commitments to the city with respect to any stipulations that may be offered in connection with such application. Failure to attend the hearing shall result in the application being tabled one time. Failure to attend the rescheduled hearing shall result in denial of the application. The requirements of this subsection may be waived by the mayor and city council, as the case might be, upon good cause shown. 
                  (q)  The following rules shall apply to the conduct of the public hearing: 
                  (1)  The presiding official shall conduct the public hearing informally, as strict adherence to the rules of evidence is not required. A goal is a fair hearing. 
                  (2)  The applicant shall first present evidence in support of the application. After the applicant has completed the presentation of evidence, opponents shall present such relevant evidence as they think appropriate after being recognized by the presiding official. 
                  (3)  All parties participating in the public hearing shall introduce only relevant evidence. 
                  (4)  All parties particiapting shall have the right to present witnesses and to cross-examine witnesses. 
                  (5)  The applicant shall have an opportunity to present rebuttal evidence, but such evidence shall be limited to points or issues raised by the opponents. 
                  (r)  At any public hearing on the application, action shall be considered by vote of the members present. A motion to approve or deny an application must be approved by an affirmative vote of at least a majority of the sitting members in order for the motion to be approved. If a motion to approve fails, the application is automatically denied. If a motion to deny fails, another motion would be in order. A tie vote on a motion for approval shall be deemed a denial of the application. A tie vote on any other motion shall be deemed to be no action, and another motion would be in order. If no action is taken by the mayor and city council, it shall be considered tabled and action deferred to the next regular meeting of the mayor and city council. 
                  (s)  In taking action on a variance application, the mayor and city council may: 
                  (1)  Approve; 
                  (2)  Approve with changes or stipulations; 
                  (3)  Deny; 
                  (4)  Table the application for consideration at its next scheduled meeting; or 
                  (5)  Allow withdrawal of the application at the request of the applicant. 
                  (t)  The mayor shall have four (4) business days after meetings of the council in which to file the city clerk in writing his/her veto. Any application regarding which a veto has been filed shall be heard at a public hearing to be held no later than sixty (60) days from the date of the council meeting at which the application issue was heard and from which meeting the veto as ultimately issued. For said hearing, the application shall be republished and posted as described in this article. 
                  (u)  A decision of the mayor and city council shall be final and may be appealed only to a court of competent jurisdiction. Such appeal must be taken within thirty (30) days of the decision of the mayor and city council. Reconsideration of an appeal under court order shall follow the same procedures of this article as though a new application.

                  (4)  The true intent and meaning of the building, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing codes or any of the regulations there under have been misconstrued or incorrectly interpreted. 
                  (b)  Variances. The mayor and council, when so appealed to and after a hearing, may vary the application of any provision of the building, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing codes to any particular case when, in its opinion after consulting with a professional engineer, the enforcement thereof would do manifest injustice and would be contrary to the spirit and purpose of the building, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing codes or public interest, and also finds all of the following: 
                  (1)  The special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the building, structure or service system involved and which are not applicable to others. 
                  (2)  That the special conditions and circumstances do not result from the action or inaction of the applicant. 
                  (3)  That granting the variance requested will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by the building, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing codes to other buildings, structures or service system. 
                  (4)  That the variance granted is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the building, structure or service system. 
                  (5)  That the grant of the variance will be in harmony with the general intent and purpose of the building, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing codes and will not be detrimental to the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (c)  Conditions of the variance. In granting the variance, the mayor and council may prescribe a reasonable time limit within which the action for which the variance is required shall be commenced or completed or both. In addition, the mayor and council may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with the building, electrical, gas, mechanical and plumbing codes. Violation of the conditions of a variance shall be deemed a violation of these codes. 
                  (d)  Notice of appeal. Notice of appeal shall be in writing and filed within thirty (30) calendar days after the decision is rendered by the building official. Appeals shall be in a form acceptable to the building official. The written notice of appeal shall be filed with the city clerk's office. 
                  (e)  Unsafe or dangerous buildings or service systems. In the case of a building, structure or service system which, in the opinion of the building official, is unsafe, unsanitary or dangerous, the building official may, in his order, limit the time for such appeals to a shorter period.

                  (3)  Nonbudget items: If the item is not included in the current year budget, the city manager must first receive approval of a budget revision from the mayor and council prior to any expenditure. Depending upon the amount, either condition (1) or (2) above will apply. 
                  (4)  Emergency situation: If an emergency situation exists, the city manager is authorized to obtain equipment or service as necessary. As soon as practical afterwards, the mayor and council will be fully informed and approve the expenditures.

                  Sec. 8-16. - Procedure for collecting special assessments and ad valorem taxes. 
                  (a)  The city finance director shall cause a bill to be issued to each delivered to the last address shown for each taxpayer on the county tax digest. Failure on the part of the taxpayer to receive a bill shall not constitute grounds for late payment, or failure to pay the tax. The tax bill contemplated herein shall adequately describe the property subject to the tax and list its fair market value as assessed. The bill shall also state the millage rate as adopted and the amount of the tax due. The bill shall also state the date after which taxes shall be considered in default and subject to the collection measures as set forth in this section. 
                  (b)  Tax bills for property also subject to a special assessment levied by the city shall include, in addition to the information contained in subsection (a) above, a separate sum due as a result of the special assessment. Said tax bill shall further include an adequate description of the basis for said special assessment and the legal authority providing for same.

Upon expiration of thirty (30) days from the aforesaid notice, the city finance director shall issue executions for nonpayment of taxes or special assessments. The execution shall include the following information: 
                  (1)  The defendant in fi. fa. (the property owner); 
                  (2)  The year(s) of taxes or special assessments due for which the execution is to be issued; 
                  (3)  A description of the property sufficient to put interested parties on notice; and 
                  (4)  All amounts of money due, including the tax, applicable special assessments, penalties, execution costs, and interest. 
                  (d)  When a properly issued tax execution or special assessment is lost or destroyed, an alias tax execution or special assessment may be issued by the city finance director and such alias tax execution or special assessment shall have the same force and effect as the lost or destroyed original.

                  Sec. 8-17. - Levy of executions, sale of real and personal property to satisfy unpaid taxes and assessments. 
                  (a)  The city finance director shall cause all executions issued to be placed in the hands of the police chief for collection or levy and sale of the property. The police chief shall exercise his best efforts to collect the full amount of taxes and assessments due, together with all interest, penalties, and any costs due thereon, from the defendant in fi. fa. In the event the police chief is unable to do so, the police chief shall levy the execution on a sufficient amount of the defendant in fi. fa.'s property, whether real or personal, to satisfy the obligations due at a sale to be held and conducted in accordance with this section. 
                  (b)  The police chief is hereby designated as the marshal of the city and delegated the duties as set forth herein. The police chief shall be subject to being ruled for money in his hands arising from the public sale of any property pursuant to process issued by the municipality. After first paying the city finance director the amount due on the process under which the sale was made, the marshal shall pay any surplus, should such exist, to any lawful claimant holding an interest subordinate to the lien for taxes. Should there still exist a surplus after all subordinate claims are satisfied, the remainder shall be paid over to the defendant in fi. fa. 
                  (c)  Whenever any real property is levied upon for taxes or assessments, it shall be the marshal's duty before proceeding to advertise the property for sale to give twenty (20) days' written notice of the levy to the record owner(s) of the property and to the holder of each secured interest holder of record. The twenty-day period shall begin to run from the time the notice is personally delivered or, when delivered by registered or certified mail with return receipt requested, from the date of mailing. The notice shall contain a description of the land levied upon, the name of the owner(s) of the land, the year(s) for which the taxes were assessed, and a statement of the amount of the taxes due, together with accrued costs. The marshal shall keep a copy of the notice on which he shall enter the date the notice was delivered or mailed and how, where, and to whom the notice was delivered. The marshal shall file the copy with the city finance director. 
                  (d)  Upon the passing of twenty (20) days after the notice contemplated in subsection (c) of this section has been delivered, the marshal shall publish weekly for four (4) weeks in the official legal organ of the county in which the sale will be conducted, an advertisement of the date, place, and hours during which the sale will be conducted, together with a full and complete description of the property to be sold, making known the names of the property owner(s) of record and any person who may be in possession of the property. The notice shall state the property is being sold for the collection of taxes and/or special assessments, when applicable, due to the city and the year(s) for which taxes and special assessments have been executed. 
                  (e)  When a levy is made on real property, the marshal shall give the defendant in fi. fa. an additional written notice of at least ten (10) days prior to the sale of said real property. The written notice shall be delivered by registered or certified U.S. mail, addressed to the taxpayer at the last known address listed in the records of the county commissioner. Notice is effective when deposited in the mail with adequate postage attached thereon. 
                  (f)  Sales of property under execution shall be made by the marshal in the chambers of the city hall on the first Tuesday in each month between the hours of 10:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. at public outcry to the highest bidder for cash. Should the first Tuesday of the month, however, fall on New Year's Day or Independence Day, such sales shall take place on the immediately following Wednesday. The purchaser shall look for himself as to the title and soundness of all property sold under tax executions and neither the marshal conducting the sale, nor the city, make any representations or warranty of title, condition, or fitness for a particular purpose, expressed or implied. 
                  (g)  The marshal shall sell the property to the highest bidder for cash and, upon collection of the sales price, make a deed or bill of sale to the purchaser. Any person who becomes the purchaser of any property sold at the sale, who fails or refuses to comply with the terms of sale when requested by the marshal to do so, shall be liable for the amount of the purchase money. It shall be the option of the marshal either to proceed against the purchaser for the full amount of the purchase money or to resell the property and then proceed against the first purchaser for any deficiency. A tax deed for real property, or bill of sale for personal property, made and delivered as evidence of a sale for taxes conducted pursuant to this Code section shall convey the title as effectually as if the sale were made by the persona against whom the process was issued. Sales of personal property shall be final; real property sold by virtue of an execution issued for the collection of taxes or for any special assessments is subject to redemption rights of the defendant in fi. fa. or any person having any right, title, or interest in or lien upon such property at the time of levy or sale. Recitals in a deed or bill of sale under power of sale for taxes shall be prima facie evidence of the facts recited in the instrument. The marshal shall put the purchaser in possession of the property so sold; provide, however, the purchaser of real property is not entitled to be placed in possession until after the time for redemption has expired. 
                  (h)  In the event that no bids are forthcoming on property offered for public sale in accordance with this section, the marshal may either re-advertise and sell the property at a later date or abandon the property. The marshal shall make a proper notation on the execution whenever property levied upon and exposed for sale has been abandoned due to a lack of bids.

                  Sec. 8-18. - Bidding by City of Powder Springs at tax sales. 
                  (a)  If, during any sale of property for taxes and/or special assessments, no one present at the sale bids an amount for the property being sold which is an amount equal to or greater than the taxes due (including any priority liens for taxes due the sate, county and school and other special tax districts of the state) plus the marshal's cost due on the sale, then the city manager, or his designee, may purchase the property for the city. If the city purchases property at a sale, the marshal shall make to the city a deed to the property sold and shall deliver the deed to the city manager. The marshal shall put the city in possession of the property so sold. 
                  (b)  Property acquired by the city pursuant to subsection (a) above may be divested or alienated by the city only by the public sale of the property to the highest bidder. However, when the city has not parted with title to the property, the city may quitclaim the property to the owner at the time of the tax sale, or to the owner's administrators, executors, heirs, or assigns, upon full payment of the redemption price provided herein.

                  Sec. 8-21. - Redemption rights of defendant infi. fa. 
                  Whenever real property is sold for taxes or any special assessment, the defendant in fi. fa. or any person having any right, title, or interest in or lien upon such property may redeem the property from the sale by the payment of the redemption price or the amount required for redemption as fixed by O.C.G.A. § 48-4-42, at any time within twelve (12) months from the date of sale, and at any time after the sale until the right to redeem is foreclosed by the giving of the notice provided for in O.C.G.A. § 48-4-45, which code section by reference are incorporated herein.

However, no levy administration fee shall be less than fifty dollars ($50.00). 
                  (c)  In addition to the levy administration fees, after levy but prior to the sale, the marshal shall collect his actual cost for advertising the sale, postage and service fees actually incurred, and any attorney's fees incurred in examination of title to property, plus a commission for conducting the sale, not to exceed eight (8) percent on sums of fifty dollars ($50.00) or less, six (6) percent on sums above fifty dollars ($50.00) up to five hundred fifty dollars ($550.00), and three (3) percent on all sums exceeding five hundred fifty dollars ($550.00).

                  All ad valorem taxes and special assessments due to the city, including penalties, interest, costs and other charges thereon, shall constitute liens on the property of the taxpayer, as well as a personal debt of the taxpayer, in the same manner and to the same extent as liens for taxes, penalties, interest, costs and other charges thereon due to the county and state.

For the purposes of this section, net income shall include, without limitation, income received as retirement, survivor, or disability benefits under the federal Social Security Act or under any other public or private retirement, disability, or pension system. The value of the residence in excess of the above-exempted amount shall remain subject to taxation. In order to qualify for the exemption provided for in this section, the person claiming such exemption shall be required to obtain a certificate from not less than one (1) nor more than three (3) physicians licensed to practice medicine under O.C.G.A. Chapter 34 of Title 43 certifying that such person is mentally or physically incapacitated to the extent that such person is unable to be gainfully employed and that such incapacity is likely to be permanent. Any such person shall not receive the benefits of such homestead exemption unless such person or his or her agent provides the tax commissioner of Cobb County with the certificates provided for in this section and files an application with such tax commissioner giving the amount of income which such person and his or her spouse received during the last taxable year for income tax purposes and such additional information relative to receiving the benefits of such exemption as will enable the tax commissioner to make a determination as to whether such person is entitled to such exemption. The tax commissioner shall provide the necessary forms for this purpose. Such applications shall be processed in the same manner as other applications for a homestead exemption, and the provisions of law applicable to the processing of homestead exemptions, as the same now exist or may hereafter be amended, shall apply thereto, but after any such person has filed the proper application and certificates, as provided above, and has been allowed the exemption provided in this section, it shall not be necessary that he or she make application and file such certificates thereafter for any year and such exemption shall continue to be allowed to such person. It shall be the duty of any such person, however, to notify the tax commissioner in the event he or she becomes ineligible for any reason for the exemption provided in this section. The increased exemption provided for in this section shall apply to all taxable years beginning after December 31, 1992. 
                  (c)  The exemption granted by subsection (b) of this section shall be in lieu of and not in addition to any exemption from Powder Springs municipal ad valorem taxes which is lower in amount for any taxable year and which is granted by the constitution or laws of this state. If the amount of any other exemption applicable to any resident is greater than or is increased to an amount greater than the amount of the exemption granted by subsection (b) of this section then such exemption shall apply rather than the exemption granted by subsection (b) of this section. 
                  (d)  The exemption granted by subsection (b) of this section shall not apply to or affect any taxes levied on behalf of Cobb County, the Cobb County School System, or state taxes, nor shall it affect or supersede any existing homestead exemption from Cobb County or Cobb County School System ad valorem taxes.

                  Sec. 11-10. - Notice of lien. 
                  If a default occurs in the payment of such sums as may be due for city water and sewer service by a customer who is either the owner of the property served or the agent of such owner, then notice shall be given to the owner of such property so served, as shown on the latest available ad valorem tax digest of the county, that the property so served is subject to a lien for such water, sewer and/or solid waste collection charges in the nature of a tax lien for special assessments.

                  Sec. 11-11. - Water and sewer line fees; required connection in new service area. 
                  (a)  This section shall apply to all water and sewer services located within the corporate limits of the city, as well as all areas served by the water and sewer system of the city whether within the corporate limits or without.

The line fee shall be an amount established by resolution, which may be amended from time to time, and shall be maintained in the office of the city clerk. In those cases in which a property owner wishes water or sewer service but there is no water or sewer line presently existing, the property owner will be required to pay the complete cost of running the water or sewer line from the existing nearest service to such person's property line; provided however, that in the future should intervening property owners desire to tap onto the water or sewer system, the property owner initially running the line shall be entitled to a rebate of the cost of running the line; provided further, that the original property owner running the line shall not be entitled to a rebate less than the charges for such owner's individual service as described in the preceding paragraph. In those circumstances where the city presently has a water or sewer line but in order to service a new customer it is necessary to upgrade the size or quality of the water or sewer line, the cost of upgrading the water or sewer line shall be borne by the new customer for which the water or sewer upgrade is necessary.

In those cases where sanitary sewer line service is available within three thousand (3,000) feet of any portion of the subdivision, the developer will be required to construct the line at such developer's sole and exclusive expense. If the available sanitary sewer connection is beyond three thousand (3,000) feet, the developer must install the trunk connecting line, but future connections to the trunk line shall be rebated to the developer for those costs in excess of three thousand (3,000) feet. 
                  (d)  All property owners within the service boundary as delineated by that certain Agreement for Wholesale Water Treatment Service and Retail Water and Wastewater Service Area Boundary with Cobb County dated August 13, 2007, as same may hereafter be amended, must connect to an existing sewer line if the sewer line is within two hundred (200) feet of any portion of such owner's property. If not available within two hundred (200) feet, a septic tank will be permitted, subject to approval by the Cobb County Health Department; however, a certificate and agreement must be signed by the property owner agreeing to connect the sewer system when it becomes available within two hundred (200) feet of his property. 
                  (e)  No commercial or industrial users or sewage generators which meet, and continue to meet, the following criteria shall be required to connect to the city's sewerage system: 
                  (1)  The total property area utilized by said user or sewerage generator shall not exceed two (2) acres. 
                  (2)  The total area of any and all buildings occupied by said user or sewage generator shall not exceed ten thousand (10,000) square feet.

                  (2)  In the event that any city employee responsible for or involved in opening a new covered account becomes aware of red flags indicating possible identity theft with respect an application for a new account, such employee shall use his or her discretion to determine whether such red flag or combination of red flags suggests a threat of identity theft. If, in his or her discretion, such employee determines that identity theft or attempted identity theft is likely or probable, such employee shall immediately report such red flags to city manager, or his/her designee. If. in his or her discretion, such employee deems that identity theft is unlikely or that reliable information is available to reconcile red flags, the employee shall convey this information to city manager, or his/her designee, who may in his or her discretion determine that no further action is necessary. If city manager, or his/her designee, in his or her discretion determines that further action is necessary, a city employee shall perform one or more of the following responses, as determined to be appropriate by city manager, or his/her designee: 
                  a.  Request additional identifying information from the applicant; 
                  b.  Deny the application for the new account; 
                  c.  Notify law enforcement of possible identity theft; or 
                  d.  Take other appropriate action to prevent or mitigate identity theft.

                  ARTICLE IX. - STORMWATER UTILITY 

                  Sec. 11-200. - Findings. 
                  The City of Powder Springs Mayor and city council make the following findings of fact: 
                  (a)  Powder Springs is authorized by the Georgia Constitution of 1983, including, without limitation, Article IX, Section II, Paragraph III thereof and O.C.G.A. § 36-82-62 to provide stormwater management services throughout Powder Springs. 
                  (b)  The federal Clean Water Act, as amended by the Water Quality Act of 1987 (33 U.S.C. § 1251 et seq.), and the rules and regulations promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency pursuant thereto emphasize the role of local governments in developing, implementing, conducting and funding stormwater programs that address water quality impacts of stormwater runoff. 
                  (c)  The city is required under federal and state regulations [i.e. National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Phase I Stormwater Permit under which the city operates] to provide enhanced management of stormwater runoff quality to mitigate the impacts of pollutants which may be discharged from the public municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) and stormwater conveyance system into State of Georgia or United States' waters. 
                  (d)  Compliance with the regulatory obligations of the NPDES Phase I Stormwater Permit, Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District and other city stormwater program activities will affect the cost of providing stormwater management services above what is currently being spent for water quality management, drainage system maintenance, flood control and other program activities. 
                  (e)  Stormwater management services and stormwater management systems and facilities contribute to the protection of surface water quality in area water bodies, reduce the likelihood of infiltration and inflow of stormwaters into the sanitary sewer system to protect operations of such system, and lessen erosion, water damage to property and impairment of water bodies, thereby assisting the city in meeting the regulatory obligations imposed by its NPDES permit. 
                  (f)  A system for the collection, conveyance, storage, treatment and disposal of stormwater provides services to all properties within the city. 
                  (g)  The city presently owns and operates stormwater management systems and facilities, which have been developed over many years. The future usefulness and operational function of the existing stormwater management systems and facilities owned and operated by the city, and the additions and improvements thereto, rests on the ability of the city to effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use, and enhance stormwater systems and facilities within the city in concert with the management of other water resources within the city. In order to do so, the city must have both a comprehensive stormwater management program as well as an adequate and stable funding source for its comprehensive program operation and drainage-related capital improvement needs. 
                  (h)  Stormwater management services and systems and facilities are needed throughout the incorporated areas of the city. While specific service and facility demands may differ from area to area at any given point of time, a stormwater management service area encompassing all lands and water bodies within the incorporated areas of the city is consistent with the present and future needs of the community. 
                  (i)  The cost of providing stormwater management services and operating and maintaining stormwater management system and financing necessary repairs, replacements, improvements and extensions thereof should, to the extent practicable, be allocated in relationship to the services received from the system. 
                  (j)  The city has undertaken a comprehensive review by an oversight committee of city residents and businesses, professional scientific consultants and staff to assess and define the city's stormwater management program problems, needs, goals, priorities as well as the stormwater management program funding strategy. 
                  (k)  Given the stormwater management program problems, needs, goals, priorities and funding strategy identified in the aforementioned professional review, the city finds that a stormwater utility provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly providing stormwater management services and stormwater management systems and facilities, and a stormwater service fee provides the most practical and appropriate means of funding stormwater management services in the city. 
                  (l)  A schedule of stormwater utility service fees based in part on the area of impervious surface located on each improved property is the most appropriate and equitable means of allocating the cost of stormwater management services throughout the city. Such service fee may be complemented by other types of fees which address specific needs, including, but not limited to, special service fees, special assessments, revenue bonds, use of proceeds from special purpose local option sales taxes and other forms of revenue, as deemed appropriate by the mayor and city council. 
                  (m)  The area of impervious surfaces on each improved property is the most important factor influencing the cost of the stormwater management services provided or to be provided by the city, and the area of impervious surfaces on each property is therefore the most appropriate parameter for calculating a periodic stormwater service fee. 
                  (n)  The existence of privately owned and maintained on-site or off-site systems, facilities, activities or assets which reduce or otherwise mitigate the impact of a particular property on the stormwater management services and/or stormwater management systems and facilities, should be taken into account to reduce the service fee on that property either in the form of a direct reduction or credit and such reduction or credit should be conditional upon continuing provision of such services, systems, facilities, activities or assets in a manner complying with the standards and codes. The stormwater service fee credit shall be determined based on technical requirements and standards contained in the Stormwater Utility Service Fee Credit Manual in its most current edition. 
                  (o)  It is imperative that the proceeds from the stormwater utility service fees, together with any other revenues raised or otherwise allocated specifically to stormwater management services, be dedicated solely to those purposes, and such proceeds should therefore be deposited into the enterprise accounting fund and remain in that fund except for disbursement for stormwater management capital, operating and non-operating costs, lease payments and debt service of bonds or other indebtedness for stormwater management purposes.

                  Sec. 11-201. - Definitions. 
                  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Act means and refers to the Clean Water Act as amended by the Water Quality Act of 1987 (33 U.S.C. § 1251 et seq.), as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency pursuant thereto. 
                  City standards mean the city ordinances that govern water quality and water quantity, including the development regulations, floodplain management ordinance, soil erosion and sediment control ordinance, illicit discharge and illegal connection ordinance, stream buffer protection, zoning stipulations, stormwater design manual and all procedures, rules and policies pertaining thereto as these may be updated or amended from time to time. 
                  Credit means a conditional reduction allowed in the amount of a stormwater service fee to the owner of a property for the existence and use of privately owned, maintained and operated on-site or off-site stormwater systems or facilities, or continuing provision of services or activities that reduce or mitigate the city's cost of providing stormwater management services for that particular property based upon the design and performance standards in the city's Stormwater Utility Service Fee Credit Manual, to be adopted pursuant to this article, as it may be updated or amended from time to time. 
                  ERU means equivalent residential unit, which is the average of the total square footage of the impervious surface area of improved single-family residential properties in the city, as determined by the city, and used as the basis for determining stormwater services fees to other properties. Two thousand eight hundred and forty square feet (2,840 sf) of impervious surface shall be the equivalent of one unit. 
                  Hydrologic response defines the manner and means whereby stormwater collects, remains, infiltrates, and is conveyed from a property. Hydrologic response is dependent on several factors including, but not limited to, the presence of impervious surface and the parcel's size, shape, vegetative canopy, and its groundwater, antecedent moisture and geologic conditions. 
                  Impervious surface means those areas which prevent or impede the infiltration of stormwater into the soil in the manner in which it entered the soil, in natural conditions, prior to development. Common impervious surfaces include, but are not limited to, rooftops, buildings or structures, sidewalks, walkways, patio areas, driveways, parking lots, storage areas, awnings and other fabric or plastic coverings, and other surfaces which prevent or impede the natural infiltration of stormwater runoff which existed prior to development. 
                  Impervious surface area means the number of square feet of horizontal surface covered by buildings and other impervious surfaces. All building measurements shall be made between exterior walls, foundation, columns or other means of support or enclosure. 
                  Improved property means property altered from its natural state by construction or installation of more than five hundred (500) square feet of impervious surfaces. 
                  Public water influence zone means those areas lying downstream of a culvert, or other stormwater management conveyance system. On the downstream side of the conveyance system, the public water influence zone will extend for a length of six (6) times the diameter (or width) of the culvert from which runoff is being discharged, as established by the Field Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia, Third Edition, pg. 99, and within the horizontal limits set forth in the aforementioned manual. For example, if a forty-eight-inch diameter culvert is discharging to a private property, the public water influence zone shall extend twenty-four (24) feet (6 times 48 inches) from the end of the culvert and for the specified width (i.e. typically the width of the creek). The Powder Springs Stormwater Utility may perform maintenance and/or capital construction activities only within that portion of the public water influence zone for which the city has an ownership interest or a dedicated easement granted to and accepted by the city for such purpose. 
                  Service area means the entire land area within the corporate limits of the city. 
                  Stormwater management services may address the quality and quantity of stormwater runoff and include all services provided by the city that relate to the: 
                  (1)  Transfer, control, conveyance or movement of stormwater runoff through the incorporated portions of the city; 
                  (2)  Maintenance, repair and replacement of existing stormwater management systems and facilities; 
                  (3)  Planning, development, design and construction of additional stormwater management systems and facilities; 
                  (4)  Regulation of the use of stormwater management services, controls, systems and facilities;

                  (6)  Education of the public about stormwater issues; 
                  (7)  Storm drain cleaning and repair, street sweeping and shoulder and ditch maintenance within the publicly owned right-of-way; 
                  (8)  Inspection and monitoring of water quantity or quality to require compliance with state or local standards and stormwater management programs; 
                  (9)  All other services related to the administration, management, maintenance, expansion, and improvement of the public stormwater management systems for the handling of stormwater runoff of private and public properties, and the regulation of the public and private stormwater management systems, controls, facilities, and activities, including the quality and quantity of runoff; and 
                  (10)  Management and administration of the stormwater utility service fee. 
                  Stormwater management systems and facilities mean those natural and manmade channels, swales, ditches, rivers, streams, creeks, branches, reservoirs, ponds, drainage ways, inlets, catch basins, pipes, headwalls, storm sewers, lakes and other physical works, properties and improvements which transfer, control, convey, detain, retain, treat or otherwise influence the movement of stormwater runoff. 
                  Stormwater utility means a fiscal entity funded by a stormwater service fee that provides stormwater management services, including infrastructure improvements. 
                  Stormwater utility manager means the public works director or other person designated by the city manager. 
                  Stormwater utility service fee means the service fee imposed by the stormwater utility to a parcel of improved property pursuant to this article that is based upon the amount of impervious surface area within each parcel or equivalent service units for providing stormwater management services and stormwater management systems and facilities. This term shall exclude special fees for development plan review, inspection of development projects, on-site stormwater control systems and other stormwater management services provided by the city for which a corresponding fee is collected for the service rendered. 
                  Undeveloped land means land in its unaltered natural condition or which is modified to such a minimal degree as to have a hydrologic response comparable to land in an unaltered natural condition. For purposes of this article, undeveloped land includes property altered from its natural condition by the creation or installation of five hundred (500) square feet or less of impervious surface. 
                  User is defined as any person who owns property that maintains connection to, discharges to, or otherwise receives services from the city for stormwater management. 
                  Water quality means the chemical, physical, and biological characteristics of the state's public waters. 
                  Water quantity means the volume of runoff which is not entirely confined and retained completely upon a parcel.

The enterprise fund may include rates, charges, and fees as may be established by the city council from time to time, and other funds that may be transferred or allocated to the stormwater utility. Any revenues and receipts of the stormwater utility shall be placed in the stormwater utility enterprise fund and shall be used solely for stormwater management services, including capital project construction. All expenses and capital investments of the stormwater utility shall be paid from the stormwater utility enterprise fund; provided, however, that other funds such as grants, loans, and bond proceeds may be applied to stormwater management services as deemed appropriate by the city. 
                  (c)  The stormwater utility manager shall be responsible for managing and implementing the stormwater management plan, stormwater management services and the stormwater utility and shall have operational control over the existing stormwater management system and facilities owned by the city as well as other related assets, including properties, other than road right-of-way, upon which such stormwater management systems and facilities are located, easements, rights-of-entry and access and certain equipment used for stormwater management.

                  Sec. 11-203. - Scope of responsibility for stormwater management systems and facilities 
                  (a)  The stormwater utility shall provide stormwater management services for existing and proposed stormwater management systems and facilities, subject to funding availability and policy determinations made in the best interest of public health, welfare and safety. The stormwater utility may accept the responsibility for providing stormwater management services to private stormwater management systems and facilities, subject to approval by the city. 
                  (b)  The city owns, or has rights established by written agreements that allow the stormwater utility to provide stormwater management services and access, operate, maintain, and improve, stormwater management systems and facilities located: 
                  (1)  Within public road rights-of-way; 
                  (2)  On private property subject to easements, rights of entry, rights of access, rights of use or other permanent provisions for operation, maintenance, improvement and access to the stormwater management system facilities located thereon; 
                  (3)  On private property but within a public water influence zone after securing a right of entry, right of access, permanent easement, temporary easement or other form of written consent from the property owner; 
                  (4)  On land dedicated to and accepted by the city solely for the operation, maintenance, improvement and access to the stormwater management systems and facilities located thereon; or, 
                  (5)  On public land owned by the city or another governmental entity for which the city has agreements providing for the operation, maintenance, improvement and access to the stormwater management systems and facilities located thereon.

                  (a)  It shall be the policy of the city that fees for stormwater management services to be provided by the stormwater utility in the designated service areas shall be equitably derived through methods which have a demonstrable relationship to the varied demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater management services by individual properties and/or the level of service rendered by, or resulting from, the provision of stormwater management services. Stormwater service fee rates shall be structured so as to be uniform within the customer class, and the resultant service fees shall bear a substantial relationship to the cost of providing stormwater management services. Service fee rates shall be in addition to other rates, charges, or fees employed for stormwater management within the incorporated areas of the city, including, but not limited to, plan review and inspection fees, fees for special services, fees in lieu of regulatory requirements, system development fees and special assessments. 
                  (b)  To the extent practicable, credits against stormwater service fees shall be provided for on-site stormwater control systems and activities constructed, operated, maintained and performed to the city's standards by public and private property owners which eliminate, mitigate or compensate for the impact that the property or person may have upon stormwater runoff discharged to public stormwater management systems and facilities or to private stormwater management systems and facilities which impact the proper function of public stormwater management systems and facilities. The methodology and criteria for a property owner to apply for and obtain a potential stormwater service fee credit for the owner's property shall be established before the stormwater service fee is billed to the property owner. 
                  (Ord. No. 2011-05, § 1, 6-6-11) 
                  Sec. 11-205. - Stormwater service fee rates. 
                  (a)  Stormwater service fee rates shall be set and may be modified from time to time by resolution of the mayor and city council. A schedule of said rates shall be on file in the office of the city clerk of the City of Powder Springs. In setting or modifying such rates it shall be the goal of the city to establish rates that are fair and reasonable, and together with other sources of support that may be available to the stormwater utility, are sufficient to support the cost of the stormwater management services, including, but not limited to, the payment of principal and interest on debt obligations, lease payments, operating expenses, capital outlays, non-operating expenses, provisions for prudent reserves and other costs as deemed appropriate by the city. 
                  (b)  The basis for calculation of the stormwater service fee on all improved properties shall be the ERU for impervious surface. Each residential property shall pay the equivalent of one (1) ERU per month. Each nonresidential property shall pay one (1) ERU for each two thousand eight hundred forty (2,840) square feet or increment thereof of impervious surface located on the property to establish the total number of ERU's for billing, with a minimum number of ERU's being one (1). Fractional ERU's will be calculated to six (6) decimals. 
                  (c)  Stormwater service fee revenues in any given year may exceed or be less than the cost of service in that year, provided, however, that the stormwater service fee rate shall be based on meeting the long-term projected cost of stormwater management programs, services, systems and facilities. All unencumbered stormwater management funds derived from service fees and other sources of revenue not expended at the end of a fiscal year shall remain in the stormwater management utility enterprise fund account and balances shall be forwarded to the next fiscal year.

                  Sec. 11-206. - Stormwater service fee exemptions. 
                  Except as provided in this section or otherwise provided by law, no public or private property located in the incorporated area of the city shall be exempt from the stormwater service fee. No exception, credit, offset, or other reduction shall be granted based on any condition unrelated to the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management service and stormwater systems and facilities. 
                  Exemptions to the stormwater service fee are as follows: 
                  1.  Parcels which contain less than five hundred (500) square feet of impervious surfaces. 
                  2.  Railroad tracks. 
                  3.  Any property whereby one hundred (100) percent of the stormwater runoff is contained or infiltrated on the property and no stormwater runoff is discharged, via overland flow or manmade conveyance, to adjacent properties or rights-of-way for all storm events up to and including the 100-year 24-hour storm event, as established to the satisfaction of the stormwater utility manager.

                  Sec. 11-207. - Stormwater service fee credits. 
                  (a)  The stormwater utility manager shall grant credits or adjustments based on the technical and procedural criteria set forth in the Stormwater Utility Service Fee Credit Manual, which shall be adopted and amended by and at the discretion of the stormwater utility manager as an operating policy of the stormwater utility. Copies of the manual shall be maintained by and available from the stormwater utility manager. 
                  (b)  Any credit allowed against the stormwater service fee is conditioned on continuing compliance with the city's design and performance standards as stated in the manual. The stormwater utility manager may revoke a credit at any time for noncompliance with applicable standards and criteria as established in the manual or this article. 
                  (c)  In order to obtain a credit, the property owner must make application to the city on forms provided by the stormwater utility manager for such purpose, and in accordance with the procedures outlined in the manual. 
                  (d)  The application for any credit must be in writing and must include the information necessary to establish eligibility for the credit. Incomplete applications will not be accepted for consideration and processing. 
                  (e)  Within thirty (30) days from the date of receipt of a complete application, the stormwater utility manager shall grant the credit in whole or in part or deny the credit. If the stormwater utility manager fails to render a decision within the thirty (30) days, the credit application shall automatically be deemed denied, but said denial shall be subject to appeal to the city manager as set forth in this article. 
                  (f)  At no time shall a credit reduce the amount charged to less than one (1) ERU.

                  Sec. 11-208. - Stormwater service fee billing delinquencies and collections. 
                  (a)  A stormwater service fee bill may be sent through the United Stated mail or by alternative means notifying the customer of the amount of the bill, the date the payment is due, and the date when past due. Failure to receive a bill is not justification for non-payment. Regardless of the party to whom the bill is initially directed, the owner of each parcel of developed land shall be ultimately obligated to pay such fee. The stormwater service fee will be billed and collected as deemed most effective and efficient by the city manager. If a customer is under billed or if no bill is sent for a particular tract of improved property, the stormwater utility may back bill for a period of up to one (1) year. 
                  (b)  Unpaid stormwater service fees shall be collected by filing suit to collect on an unpaid account and by using all methods allowed by state law to collect on any judgment obtained thereby, including enforcement of any lien resulting from any such judgment. 
                  (c)  A late charge of five (5) percent of the unpaid balance of any stormwater utility service fee bill shall be charged when a bill becomes delinquent. Thereafter, an additional charge of one (1) percent based on the unpaid bill and any applicable delinquency charge shall be charged for each month the bill remains delinquent. In addition, the city shall assess all costs of collection, including attorney's fees and court costs, against the property owner. 
                  (Ord. No. 2011-05, § 1, 6-6-11) 
                  Sec. 11-209. - Enforcement methods and inspections. 
                  (a)  All property owners of improved property within the incorporated areas of the city shall provide, manage, maintain, and operate on-site stormwater management systems sufficient to collect, convey, detain, and discharge stormwater runoff in a safe manner consistent with all applicable city development regulations, ordinances, and state and federal laws. 
                  (b)  The stormwater utility manager or person designated by the manager or city manager shall be permitted to enter and inspect properties and facilities at reasonable times as often as may be necessary to determine compliance with this article. 
                  (1)  If a property or facility has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the owner or operator shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access to the manager or designee. 
                  (2)  The owner or operator shall allow the manager or designee ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, testing, photography and videotaping in order to ensure compliance with this article. The manager or designee shall be permitted to examine and copy records that are required under the conditions of an NPDES permit or development permit to discharge stormwater. 
                  (3)  The manager or designee shall have the right to set up on any property or facility such devices as are necessary in his or her opinion to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of flow discharges. 
                  (4)  The manager or designee may require the owner or operator to install monitoring equipment and perform monitoring as necessary, and make the monitoring data available to the city. This sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the owner or operator at his or her own expense. All devices used to measure flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy. 
                  (5)  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the property or facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the owner or operator at the written or oral request of the director or designee and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the owner or operator. 
                  (6)  Unreasonable delays in allowing the manager or designee access to a facility is a violation of this article. 
                  (7)  If the manager or designee has been refused access to any part of the premises from which stormwater is discharged, and he or she is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this article, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this article or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, environment and welfare of the community, then the manager or designee may seek issuance of an inspection warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction. 
                  (8)  The manager or designee may determine inspection schedules necessary to enforce the provisions of this article. 
                  (c)  Any failure to meet the obligations set forth in this section shall constitute a violation of this article and be subject to citation and prosecution in the Powder Springs Municipal Court. Each day such violation exists shall constitute a separate offense, subject to the penalties allowed by law. 
                  (d)  Alternatively, in the event a public nuisance is deemed to exist by the stormwater utility manager, the city may elect to sue in the Powder Springs Municipal Court to abate such nuisance. In the event a public nuisance is found by the court to exist, which the property owner fails to abate within such reasonable time as allowed by the Powder Springs Municipal Court, the city may enter upon the property and cause work as is reasonably necessary to be performed, and the actual cost thereof shall become a special assessment upon said property, which special assessment may be enforced and collected in accordance with section 8-16 et seq. of this Code.

The city manager shall affirm, reverse, affirm in part, or reverse in part the decision of the stormwater utility manager after hearing the evidence. All decisions of the city manager shall be served on the customer personally or by registered or certified mail, sent to the billing address of the customer. If the decision of the city manager results in a refund or credit to the property owner, then such refund or credit shall be calculated retroactive to the date of the initial appeal. 
                  (5)  The decision of the city manager shall be final, and there shall be no further administrative action. Any person aggrieved by the decision of the city manager may appeal that decision to the Superior Court of Cobb County by Writ of Certiorari within thirty (30) days of the decision.

                  a.  Conviction of, or the entering of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere by, the licensee or any of his employees or any person holding an interest in the license for any felony, any law, administrative regulation or ordinance involving alcoholic beverages, gambling or narcotics, or tax laws. 
                  b.  Conviction of, or the entering of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere by, the licensee or any of his employees or any person holding an interest in the license.

                  f.  Any other factor known to or discovered by the city whereby it is objectively shown the licensee, any of the licensee's employees or any person holding an interest in a license, has engaged in conduct at or involving the licensed business or has permitted conduct on the licensed premises that constitutes a violation of federal or state law, local ordinance or administrative regulations involving alcoholic beverages, gambling or narcotics for all alcohol licensed businesses and including any sex offense under state law or local ordinances with respect to businesses licensed for on-premises consumption. With respect to this section, it shall be rebuttably presumed that the violative act was done with the knowledge or consent of the licensee; provided, however, that such presumption may be rebutted only by evidence which precludes every other reasonable hypothesis save that such licensee did not know, assist or aid in such occurrence, or in the exercise of full diligence that such licensee could not have discovered or prevented such activity.

At the hearing the licensee shall have the right to represent itself or be represented by counsel, may cross examine all witnesses offered by the city, and may call witnesses and present evidence in its own behalf. Formal rules of evidence shall not apply to hearings under this section, although the hearing officer shall have the right to exclude evidence which carries no indicia of reliability.

Such sanction may include one (1) or more of the following: revocation of the license, suspension of the license for no more than twelve (12) months, imposition of a probationary period not to exceed twelve (12) months, and/or a civil monetary penalty not to exceed the amount allowed under the city charter. Progressive sanctions, depending on the severity of the violation, are encouraged but not required. Where the remaining term of the license is less than twelve (12) months, imposition of suspension or probation for a period in excess of the term of the existing license shall be applied to any renewal license. A subsequent violation within a probationary period shall be cause for revocation and/or denial of license renewal. A total of three (3) separate and unrelated violations within twenty-four (24) months, whether or not within a probationary period, shall be grounds for permanent revocation. 
                  (7)  The hearing officer's decision shall be personally served or mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested to the licensee and his attorney, with a copy to the city attorney, within ten (10) business days of the close of the hearing. The decision of the hearing officer shall constitute final action by the city, subject to review upon petition for certiorari to the superior court. 
                  (8)  Upon receipt of notice of adverse action against the licensee under this section, the licensee may waive its right to a hearing and stipulate to a sanction, as recommended by the city manager, in consultation with the chief of police. Any stipulation entered under this subsection shall be in writing, signed by the licensee, and non-appealable.

If, after examination of the books or records, it is determined that a deficiency occurs as a result of underreporting, a penalty of one hundred twenty-five (125) percent of the prime interest rate times the amount deficient will be assessed for the period delinquent. For purposes of this section, the prime interest rate shall be that which is published by The Wall Street Journal on the first business day of the year in which the underreporting is identified. Provided however, to the extent that the city requires that the billing records of an attorney be made available for inspection by the city, the attorney may redact such confidential information from said billing records as may be necessary to protect the attorney-client privilege.

                  ARTICLE XIII. - LAWYERS AND LAW FIRMS 

                  Sec. 12-350. - Scope and levy. 
                  (a)  It is the intent of the city that the tax imposed in this section is for revenue purposes only. The city expressly acknowledges that it cannot regulate the practice of law, and no portion of this article shall be construed in such a manner as to constitute the regulation of the practice of law. The city further expressly recognizes that the regulation of the practice of law is the exclusive province of the state supreme court and its authorized representatives. Further, it is not the intent of this section to impose any precondition upon the practice of law. In keeping with these principles, and pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 48-13-6 et seq., all persons, including professional corporations, engaged in the practice of law in the city are hereby required to pay the amount now or hereafter fixed as the occupation tax thereon. 
                  (b)  Persons practicing law in the city but not maintaining an office in the city. 
                  (1)  The provisions of this article shall apply to those persons practicing law with no location or office in the city if the person: 
                  a.  Has one (1) or more employees or agents who exert substantial efforts within the city for the purpose of soliciting business or serving clients; or 
                  b.  Owns personal or real property which generates income related to the practice of law and which is located in the city. 
                  (2)  In no event shall a person practicing law subject to this subsection be required to pay an occupation tax to more than one (1) local government in the state and then only to the local government in which the largest dollar volume of business is done or service is performed by the person. 
                  (3)  If a person subject to this subsection provides to the business registration division proof of payment of a local business or occupation tax in another state, or county or municipality of this state which purports to tax the practitioner's services in this state, the practitioner shall be exempt for the levy of any occupational tax under this section.

                  Sec. 12-351. - Attorneys not required to register. 
                  (a)  Notwithstanding any language to the contrary elsewhere in this chapter, an attorney shall not be required to register with the business registration division. Information reported with any occupation tax payment may be retained by the business registration division and used for those purposes allowed by applicable law. 
                  (b)  Notwithstanding any language to the contrary elsewhere in this chapter, an attorney shall not be required to obtain, display, or maintain any city issued certificate showing that any payment or information has been submitted to the business registration division. 
                  (c)  For the purposes of enforcement of the zoning ordinance, attorneys may be asked to submit notarized affidavits or other written information concerning the business or profession carried on at a location and the dates of operation when applying for a certificate of occupancy for new construction or renovation. Such affidavits or documents shall be used for the purposes of determining compliance with the zoning ordinance and shall not prevent the practice of the profession of law at any other location which has a valid certificate of occupancy. 
                  (d)  A refusal to submit a notarized affidavit or other written information stating whether a person engages in the practice of law at a particular location or stating the dates of operation at a location shall not be a violation of this article and shall not prevent an attorney from practicing law in the city. The business registration division manager may document this refusal. Where an attorney fails or refuses to provide information as to the location where they may be served with notices issued in support of the enforcement of this article, the county shall direct the notices to the address listed with the state bar and shall consider the failure or refusal of the attorney to provide current address information to be consent to this method of service.

                  (a)  Notwithstanding any language to the contrary, an attorney shall not be required to pay the occupation tax on the income generated from the practice of law prior to or during the calendar year in which it is earned. Rather, the occupation tax for the preceding calendar year shall be due January 1 of the following year and payable without interest accrued until February 1 at which time the tax will be delinquent and accrue interest. The tax may be paid in person at the business registration division or by mailing the tax to the business registration division. Any tax payment made by mail shall include the name and address of the person or law firm paying the tax and the name of each attorney whose tax is being paid, so that the business registration division may process the payment. An attorney who pays the occupation tax on his own behalf shall include the name of the law firm with which he practices, if any. Any tax paid pursuant to the option of subsection 12-353(1) shall include a written submission containing sufficient information to enable the business license division manager to determine the accuracy of the taxpayer's calculation. 
                  (b)  If during any one (1) calendar year, a person practices law in the city for less than one (1) year, his occupation tax shall be prorated based upon the gross receipts he practiced in the city during that calendar year.

                  (2)  A fee according to a schedule approved by the city council not to exceed four hundred dollars ($400.00) per attorney, such tax to be paid at the attorney's office or location; provided, however, that an attorney paying according to this subsection shall not be required to provide information to the local government relating to the gross receipts of the business or attorney. The per-attorney fee includes all persons in the firm who qualify as an attorney under the state's regulatory guidelines and framework.

                  Sec. 12-355. - Classification of businesses. 
                  Every business subject to the provisions of this article shall be classified according to the major group classification of the Standard Industrial Classification Manual, as amended, and published under the auspices of the U.S. Office of Management and Budget.

                  (1)  Where the practitioner can reasonably allocate the dollar amount of gross receipts of the practitioner to one (1) or more of the locations or offices on the basis of services provided in that location or office, the city is authorized to tax the gross receipts generated by the location or office within the city; or 
                  (2)  Where the practitioner cannot reasonably allocate the dollar amount of gross receipts among multiple locations or offices, the practitioner shall divide the gross receipts reported to all local governments in this state by the number of locations or offices of the practitioner which contributed to the gross receipts reported to any local government in this state, and shall allocate an equal percentage of such gross receipts of the practitioner to each location or office. 
                  (b)  In no instance shall the sum of the portions of the total gross receipts of a practitioner taxed by all local governments exceed one hundred (100) percent of the total gross receipts of the practitioner.

                  (a)  Notwithstanding any language to the contrary elsewhere in this article, the business registration division manager may choose to send bills to attorneys who list their address with the state bar as being located in the city. 
                  (b)  An attorney who prepares and signs a notarized affidavit that they did not practice law within the jurisdiction of the city during some part of the tax year for which the tax bill was generated may have their bill adjusted for the time period stated in the affidavit when such attorney did not maintain an office within the jurisdiction of the city and/or states such other reasons why the occupation tax should be adjusted. Such adjustment shall not be made for those attorneys who elect to pay the four hundred dollars ($400.00) per practitioner fee unless the affidavit states that the attorney did not practice law in the jurisdiction of the city at any time during the year for which the tax bill was generated. The business registration division manager is authorized to inquire whether such affidavit matches the information maintained by the state bar in connection with the directives of State Bar Rule 1-207 and/or to take such other steps as deemed necessary to determine the accuracy of the affidavit. The submission of an affidavit requesting adjustment shall not act to prevent the imposition of interest should the business registration division manager deny the request for adjustment. 
                  (c)  The option of the business registration division manager to send bills shall not relieve attorneys from the obligation to pay any tax due for any calendar year by January 31 of the following year. 
                  (d)  The business registration division manager may include in any bills, the unpaid tax balance from three (3) other years, including all fees and penalties and the amount of interest, which has accrued on any unpaid tax liability. The failure of the business registration division manager to list any unpaid balance on any bill shall not operate to relieve the taxpayer from liability for any balance due. 
                  (e)  It shall be a violation of this section for any attorney to willfully and intentionally misrepresent a material fact in an affidavit to avoid the payment of the occupation tax, and the sole enforcement action to be taken is set forth as follows: 
                  (1)  When the business registration division manager has reason to believe that an attorney has willfully and intentionally misrepresented a material fact in any affidavit submitted to business registration division for the purposes of avoiding full payment of the occupation tax, he or she shall consult with the city attorney to determine whether such conduct should be referred to the state bar for investigation as to whether a violation of the state rules of professional conduct has occurred.

                  Sec. 12-363. - Tax execution imposed for failure to pay the occupation tax. 
                  An attorney required to pay the occupation tax and who fails to do so in the manner provided by this article, shall be liable to have the tax and interest collected by the issuance of execution by the business registration division manager or ex officio deputy pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 48-13-26. Further proceedings concerning the execution procedure employed in the enforcement of this section shall be as provided by state law. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, the use of tax executions and the reporting of any alleged misrepresentations shall be the sole mechanism for enforcement of the occupation tax levy against attorneys, and neither this article nor any other portion of the ordinances of the city authorize any civil fine or associated contempt charges for failure to comply with this article.

                  Sec. 13-28. - Curfew for minors. 
                  (a)  Purposes. The mayor and council for the city have determined that there has been an increase in juvenile violence and crime by persons under the age of eighteen (18) in Powder Springs resulting in juveniles being involved in a wide range of unacceptable behavior by juveniles; that persons under the age of eighteen (18) are particularly susceptible by their lack of maturity and experience to participate in unlawful activity and to be victims of older perpetrators of crime; that there has been a significant breakdown in the supervision and guidance normally provided by parents for minors resulting in an increase in the crimes, substance abuse, and school dropout rates, juvenile pregnancy, and other illicit behavior. The city has an obligation to provide for the protection of minors from each other and from other persons, for the enforcement of parental control over and responsibility for children, for the protection of the general public, and for the reduction of the incidence of juvenile criminal activities which are not easily controlled by existing laws and ordinances. The mayor and council have determined a curfew for those under the age of eighteen (18) will be in the interest of the public health, safety, and general welfare and will help to attain the foregoing objectives and to diminish the undesirable impact of such conduct on the citizens of the city and will promote the public good, safety and welfare. Parental responsibility for the whereabouts of children is the accepted norm and legal sanction to enforce such responsibility have had demonstrated effectiveness in many cities. The mayor and council have determined that a curfew ordinance will increase parental responsibility for minor within their control and decrease minor delinquency. 
                  (b)  Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply:

                  Editor's note— Ord. No. 94-5, adopted and effective Apr. 4, 1994, did not specifically amend this Code; hence, inclusion as § 13-28 was at the discretion of the editor. 
                  Sec. 13-29. - Daytime curfew for minors. 
                  (a)  Purposes. The mayor and council have determined that there has been an increase in juvenile violence and crime by persons under the age of eighteen (18) in the city resulting in juveniles being involved in a wide range of unacceptable behavior including armed robberies, robberies, assault and batteries, drug use, breaking and entering; that person under the age of eighteen (18) are particularly susceptible by their lack of maturity and experience to participate in unlawful activity and to be victims of older perpetrator of crime; and that there has been a significant breakdown in the supervision and guidance normally provided by parents for minors resulting in an increase in the crimes and other unacceptable behavior, such as illiteracy, juvenile pregnancy, increased school drop-out rate; the city has an obligation to provide for the protection of minors from each other and from other persons, for the enforcement of parental control over and responsibility for children, for the protection of the general public, and for the reduction of the incidence of juvenile criminal activities which are not easily controlled by existing laws and ordinances. The mayor and council have determined a truancy ordinance of those of school age will be in the interest of the public health, safety, and general welfare and will help to attain the foregoing objectives and to diminish the undesirable impact of such conduct on the citizens of the city and will promote the public good, safety and welfare. Parental responsibility for the whereabouts of children is the accepted norm and legal sanctions to enforce such responsibility have had demonstrated effectiveness in many cities. The mayor and council have determined that a truancy ordinance will increase parental responsibility for minors within their control and decrease minor delinquency.

The existence of overcharging shall be presumed from a twenty-five (25) percent or greater increase in the price at which the merchandise or rate, fee or cost/rental of housing was offered in the usual course of business immediately prior to the onset of the emergency or disaster, but shall not include increases in cost to the supplier directly attributable to the higher cost of material, supplies and labor costs resulting from the emergency. 
                  Subsequent recovery period means that period during which the emergency or disaster continues to cause disruptions in the area designated in the declaration of emergency, but shall not exceed six months after the declaration has been terminated, unless extended by action of the city council.

                  Sec. 21-5. - Duties of property owners.

Such appointment and designation shall include the designee of such person. 
                  (b)  Complaint and investigation. Whenever a request is filed with the public officer by a public authority or by at least five (5) residents charging that any dwelling, building, structure, or property: 
                  (1)  Is unfit for human habitation or for commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; 
                  (2)  Is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or 
                  (3)  Constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the public officer shall make an investigation or inspection of the specific dwelling, building, structure, or property to determine if such conditions exist under applicable codes. The public officer shall have the authority to enter upon premises to conduct an inspection, provided such entry is made with the least possible inconvenience to the person(s) in possession. If such an inspection is necessary, the public officer shall endeavor to obtain the permission of the owner to conduct such inspection. If permission is withheld, the public officer may seek the assistance of the city attorney's office to obtain an inspection warrant from a court of competent jurisdiction. The public officer may determine under existing ordinances that a dwelling, building, or structure is unfit for human habitation or for commercial, industrial, or business use upon a finding of conditions on the dwelling, building, or structure which are dangerous or injurious to the health, safety, or morals of the occupants, occupants of neighboring dwellings, buildings, or structures, or other residents of the city. Such conditions may include the following (without limiting the generality of the foregoing): defects therein increasing the hazards of fire, accidents, or other calamities; lack of adequate ventilation, light, or sanitary facilities; dilapidation; disrepair; structural defects; and uncleanliness. The public officer may determine that the property is being used in the commission of drug crimes upon personal observation or report of a law enforcement agency and evidence of drug crimes being committed. 
                  (c)  Judicial complaint and summons. If the public officer's investigation or inspection confirms that any property meets one (1) or more of the three (3) enumerated standards from subsection (b), the public officer may file in a court of competent jurisdiction a complaint in rem against the lot, tract, or parcel of real property wherein the nuisance complained of exists and shall cause summons and a copy of the complaint to be served on the interested parties for such dwelling, building, or structure pursuant to the provisions of section 21-7. The complaint shall identify the subject real property by appropriate street address and official tax map reference; identify the interested parties; state with particularity the factual basis for the action; and contain a statement of the action sought by the public officer to abate the alleged nuisance. 
                  (d)  Time of hearing. The summons shall notify the interested parties that a hearing will be held before a court of competent jurisdiction at a date and time certain. Such hearing shall be held not less than fifteen (15) days nor more than forty-five (45) days after the filing of said complaint. 
                  (e)  Right to be heard. The interested parties shall have the right to file an answer to the complaint and to appear in person or by attorney and offer testimony at the time and place fixed for the hearing. 
                  (f)  Order. If, after such notice and hearing, the court determines that the dwelling, building, or structure in question meets one or more of the standards enumerated in subsection (b) so as to constitute a public nuisance, the court shall state in writing findings of fact in support of such determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the interested parties that have answered the complaint or appeared at the hearing an order which does one of the following: 
                  (1)  If the repair of the said dwelling, building, or structure can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to its present value, the order shall require the owner, within a specified time, to repair such property so as to bring it into full compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violation and, if applicable, to effect a closing of any structure so that it cannot be used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or 
                  (2)  If the repair of the said dwelling, building, or structure in order to bring it into full compliance with applicable codes relevant to the cited violations cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value thereof, the order shall require the owner, within a specified time, to demolish and remove such dwelling, building, or structure and all debris from the property. 
                  For purposes of this section, the court shall make its determination of "reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure" without consideration of the value of the land on which the structure is situated; provided, however, that costs of the preparation necessary to repair a structure may be considered. Income and financial status of the owner shall not be a factor in the court's determination. The present value of the structure and the costs of repair, alteration, or improvement may be established by affidavits of real estate appraisers with a Georgia appraiser classification as provided in O.C.G.A. Title 43, Chapter 39A, qualified building contractors, or qualified building inspectors without actual testimony presented. Costs of repair, alteration, or improvement of the structure shall be the cost necessary to bring the structure into compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violations. 
                  (g)  Remedies of public officer in the event of noncompliance with order. 
                  (1)  The order entered under subsection (f) shall further provide that, if the owner fails to comply with an order to repair or demolish the dwelling, building, or structure within the specified time, the public officer may cause such dwelling, building, or structure to be repaired, altered, or improved or to be vacated and closed or demolished. Such abatement action shall commence within two hundred seventy (270) days after the expiration of time specified in the order for abatement by the owner. Any time during which such action is prohibited by a court order issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 41-2-13 or any other equitable relief granted by a court of competent jurisdiction shall not be counted toward the two hundred seventy (270) days in which such abatement action must commence. 
                  (2)  If the public officer chooses to have the work done as ordered on any dwelling building or structure, he or she shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of the building, dwelling, or structure a placard with the following words: 
                  This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business use and does not comply with the applicable codes or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with drug crimes or constitutes an endangerment to public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful. 
                  (h)  Salvage. If the public officer has a structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any moneys received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. Neither the public officer nor the city shall have any liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials. 
                  (i)  Lien for costs. The order shall provide that the amount of the cost of demolition, including all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the city finance director, and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, including restoration to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred. Such costs shall include but not be limited to the cost of demolition, reasonable attorneys' fees and all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the tax commissioner, restoration to grade of the real property should it be demolished, and title examination costs. Such lien shall attach to the real property upon the filing of a certified copy of the order requiring repair, closure, or demolition, in the office of the clerk of superior court, and shall relate back to the date of the filing of the lis pendens notice required under subsection 21-7(b). The clerk of superior court shall record and index such certified copy of the order in the deed records of the county and enter the lien on the general execution docket. Such lien should cross reference the order and include the original caption and case number from the nuisance abatement action. The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except liens for taxes to which the lien shall be inferior, and shall continue in force until paid in full. 
                  (j)  Enforcement of lien. 
                  (1)  Upon a final determination of costs, fees, and expenses incurred in accordance with this chapter, the public officer shall transmit to the city finance director a statement of the total amount due and secured by said lien, together with copies of all notices provided to interested parties. The statement of the public officer shall be transmitted within ninety (90) days of completion of the repairs, demolition, or closure. It shall be the duty of the city finance director to collect the amount of the lien using all methods available for collecting real property ad valorem taxes, including specifically O.C.G.A. Title 48, Chapter 4; provided, however, that the limitation of O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 which requires twelve (12) months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure shall not apply. The city finance director shall remit the amount collected to the city. 
                  (2)  Enforcement of liens may be initiated at any time following receipt by the city finance director of the final determination of costs. The unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties from and after the date of final determination of costs in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes. An enforcement proceeding pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 for delinquent ad valorem taxes may include all amounts due under this chapter. 
                  (3)  The redemption amount in any enforcement proceeding shall be the full amount of the costs as finally determined with interest, penalties, and costs incurred by the city and the city finance director in the enforcement of the lien. Redemption of the property from the lien may be made in accordance with the provisions of O.C.G.A. § 48-4-40 and 48-4-81. 
                  (k)  Waiver of lien. The mayor and council may waive and release any such lien imposed on property of the owner for costs incurred by the city up to the time of the entry of the order and any additional costs incurred subsequent thereto in attempting to bring the property into compliance by entering into a contract with the owner in which the owner agrees to a timetable for rehabilitation of the real property or the dwelling, building, or structure on the property and demonstrates the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation. 
                  (l)  Appellate procedure. Where the abatement action does not commence in the superior court, review of a court order requiring the repair, alteration, improvement, or demolition of a property shall be by direct appeal to the superior court under O.C.G.A. § 5-3-29. 
                  (m)  Alternate remedies. Nothing in this section shall be construed as to limit or impair the authority of public officers or other city employees under existing and future ordinances to issue citations for violations of state minimum standard codes, optional building, fire, life safety, and other codes adopted by ordinance, and conditions creating a public health hazard or general nuisance, and to seek to enforce such citations in a court of competent jurisdiction prior to issuing a complaint in rem as provided in this Code section. The issuance of a citation for a violation of any such codes shall not be required as a prerequisite to issuing a complaint in rem under this section.

                  Sec. 21-7. - Service and notice. 
                  (a)  Copies of the complaint and summons shall be served in each of the following ways as applicable: 
                  (1)  At least fourteen (14) days prior to the date of the hearing, the public officer shall mail copies of the complaint by certified mail or statutory overnight delivery, return receipt requested, to all interested parties whose identity and address are reasonably ascertainable. Copies of the complaint shall also be mailed by first class mail to the property address to the attention of the occupants of the property, if any, and shall be posted on the property within three (3) business days of filing the complaint and at least fourteen (14) days prior to the date of the hearing. 
                  (2)  For an interested party whose mailing address is unknown, a notice stating the date, time, and place of the hearing shall be published in the newspaper in which the sheriff's advertisements appear in such county once a week for two (2) consecutive weeks prior to the hearing. 
                  (b)  A notice of lis pendens shall be filed in the office of the clerk of superior court in the county in which the dwelling, building, or structure is located at the time of filing the complaint in the appropriate court. Such notice shall have the same force and effect as other lis pendens notices provided by law. 
                  (c)  Orders and other filings made subsequent to service of the initial complaint and summons shall be served in the manner provided in this section on any interested party who answers the complaint or appears at the hearing. Any interested party who fails to answer or appear at the hearing shall be deemed to have waived all further notice in the proceedings.

                  Sec. 21-8. - Emergency nuisance abatement. 
                  Nothing in this article shall prevent the city from entering private property in order to abate a nuisance which poses an imminent threat to life or property. Any such action shall be limited to that which is necessary to abate the imminent threat until proceedings pursuant to this article can be carried out.

                  --- (2) --- 
                  Editor's note— Ord. No. 2012-30, § 1(Exh. A), adopted Aug. 20, 2012, repealed the former Art. II, §§ 21-11—21-16, and enacted a new Art. II as set out herein. The former Art. II pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 2010-54, § 3, adopted Jan. 3, 2011. 

                  Sec. 21-11. - Purpose. 
                  The mayor and council declare and find that improperly maintained and secured foreclosed or vacant properties can become a hazard to the health and safety of persons who may come on or near the property and can adversely affect the aesthetic and economic qualities of the areas within the city. Difficulties also often arise in locating the person responsible for the condition of foreclosed real property. The mayor and council find that there is a substantial need directly related to the public health, safety and welfare to comprehensively address these concerns. It is therefore the purpose and intent of this article to establish a registration program for properties that have been foreclosed or are vacant as a mechanism to protect areas of the city from becoming blighted through the lack of adequate maintenance and adequate security of abandoned properties.

For all of these reasons, it is essential to public health, safety and welfare that such properties be properly maintained, cured of code violations and secured.
