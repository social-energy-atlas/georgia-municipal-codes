PREFACE 
</p>
        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Cornelia, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the Prior Code and ordinances adopted through September 11, 2007, by the City Commission. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the Prior Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Index 
The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Villeta Coombs, Code Attorney, Jim Jenkins, Code Attorney, and Kyle S. Meyer, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Donald Anderson, City Manager, Mr. Steve Campbell, City Attorney, Ms. Janie Henderson, City Clerk, and Mr. Ross Hubbard, Interim City Manager, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the City of Cornelia readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

                  Sec. 2-78. - Findings. 
                  The city commission finds that: 
                  (1)  The public judges its government by the way public officials and employees conduct themselves in the posts to which they are elected or appointed. 
                  (2)  All government of right originates with the people, is founded upon their will only, and is instituted solely for the good of the whole. Public officers are the trustees and servants of the people and are at all times amenable to them pursuant to Ga. Const. art. 1, § 2, ¶ 1. 
                  (3)  The people of this state have the inherent right to regulate their internal government. Government is instituted for the protection, security, and benefit of the people, and at all times, the people have the right to alter or reform the same whenever the public good may require it pursuant to Ga. Const. art. 1, § 2, ¶ 2. 
                  (4)  The people have the right to expect that every public official will conduct himself/herself in a manner that will tend to preserve public confidence in and respect for the government he/she represents. 
                  (5)  Such confidence and respect can be best promoted if every public official, whether paid or unpaid, and whether elected or appointed, will uniformly: 
                  a.  Treat all citizens with courtesy, impartiality, fairness and equality under the law; and 
                  b.  Avoid conflicts between his/her private self-interest and the public interest. 
                  (Prior Code, § 47-1) 
                  Sec. 2-79. - Policy of city; purpose; applicability. 
                  (a)  It is the policy of the city that the proper operation of democratic government requires that the public officials be independent, impartial and responsible to the people, that governmental decisions and policy be made in proper channels of the governmental structure, that public office not be used for personal gain, and that the public may have confidence in the integrity of its government. In recognition of these goals, a code of ethics for all city officials, set forth as this article, is adopted. 
                  (b)  The purpose of this article is to: 
                  (1)  Encourage high ethical standards in official conduct by city officials; 
                  (2)  Establish guidelines for ethical standards of conduct for all such officials by setting forth those acts or actions that are incompatible with the best interest of the city; 
                  (3)  Require disclosure by such officials of private financial or other interest in manners that affect the city; and 
                  (4)  Serve as a basis for disciplining those who refuse to abide by its terms. 
                  (c)  The provisions of this article shall not apply to political contributions, loans, expenditures reports or regulations of political campaigns or the conduct of candidates in such campaigns.

III, § VI, ¶ VII; certain nude and sexual conduct, use of devices or objects to perform or simulate such conduct, and showing and displaying of pictures, etc., prohibited, O.C.G.A. § 3-3-41; use of premises for obscenity or related offenses constitutes nuisance, O.C.G.A. § 16-12-82; local government authorized to restrict adult bookstores, explicit media outlets, and adult movie houses to certain areas, O.C.G.A. § 36-60-3. 

                  ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

                  Sec. 4-1. - Purpose. 
                  The purpose of this chapter is to regulate certain types of businesses, including, but not limited to, adult entertainment establishments, to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses will be curtailed. However, it is recognized that such regulation cannot de facto approach prohibition. Otherwise, a protected form of expression would vanish. As to adult dance establishments, this chapter represents a balancing of competing interests: reduced criminal activity and protection of the neighborhoods through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments, versus the protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons.

                  Sec. 6-110. - Employee and manager regulations; employee pouring permits. 
                  The following regulations shall apply to all establishments holding a license for consumption of alcoholic beverages on the premises: 
                  (1)  No person shall be employed to dispense, sell, serve, take orders, mix alcoholic beverages, or serve in any managerial position by an establishment holding a license under this chapter until such person has been cleared by the chief of police or his/her designee indicating that the person is eligible for such employment and may be issued an employee pouring permit under this section. 
                  (2)  This section shall not be construed to include employees whose duties are limited solely to those of a busboy, cook or dishwasher. 
                  (3)  No employee pouring permit shall be issued until such time as a signed application has been filed with the police department or such department's designee and upon payment of a fee established by the city and a search of the criminal record of the applicant completed. The application shall include, but shall not be limited to, the name, date of birth, and prior arrest record of the person, though the fact of an arrest record shall be used for investigative purposes only, and shall give rise to no presumption or inference of guilt. Due to the inclusion of arrest information, these applications shall be regarded as confidential and shall not be produced for public inspection without a court order. 
                  (4)  The chief of police or his/her designee shall have a complete and exhaustive search made relative to any criminal record of the applicant. If there is no record of a violation of this chapter, the chief or his/her designee shall issue an employee pouring permit to the applicant. If it is found that the person is not eligible for employment, the chief of police or his/her designee shall notify such person at the address contained in the application, in writing, that such person is not eligible for employment, the cause of such denial, and right of such person to appeal. 
                  (5)  No person shall be granted an employee pouring permit unless it appears to the satisfaction of the chief of police or his/her designee that such person has not been convicted of, pled guilty to, or entered a plea of nolo contendere to any federal, state or local law for any felony and/or crime involving moral turpitude, including but not limited to, illegal gambling, illegal sale or transfer of alcoholic beverages to minors, keeping a place of prostitution, solicitation of sodomy, or the commission of any sexually related crime within a period of five years of the date of conviction and been released from parole or probation. If the applicant has been convicted of, plead guilty to, or entered a plea of nolo contendere to such a crime under the circumstances set forth above, the applicant may show that substantial steps have been taken to rehabilitate his or her character through: a) successful completion of his/her sentence (which would include completion of the sentence without revocation of probation); and/or, b) submission of at least three affidavits of employers, previous employers and members of the community stating: a) that the applicant has rehabilitated his or her character; b) the basis for the opinion that the character of the applicant has been rehabilitated; and c) that the affiant would believe the applicant under oath. Upon submission of this additional information, and submission of an affidavit (executed in person at the Cornelia Police Department) of the person or entity holding the underlying license for consumption of alcoholic beverages on the premises that such person or entity understands that any violation of the employee pouring permit issued to the applicant under this section may result in the revocation of the applicable consumption of alcoholic beverages on the premises license, and may result in additional penalties for violation of this section, an employee pouring permit may be issued to the applicant. For purposes of this subsection, a conviction or plea of guilt or nolo contendere shall be ignored as to any offense for which a person whose sentence was entered under the Georgia First Offender Act, as amended; provided, however, that any such offense shall not be ignored if the person violated any term of probation imposed by the court granting first offender treatment or committed another crime and the sentencing court therefor entered an adjudication of guilt as to the crime for which the person had previously been sentenced as a first offender. 
                  (6)  An employee pouring permit shall be issued for a period of one calendar year from the date of the original application. As noted in subsection (11) of this section, the employee pouring permit must be in the possession of the employee while the employee is working at the licensed establishment. This permit must be in the possession of the employee while the employee permit holder is working and must be available for inspection by members of the police department or the city's staff. 
                  (7)  No person shall be issued a permit if it is determined that the person falsified, concealed or covered up any material fact by any device, trick or scheme while making an application to the police department for an employee pouring permit under this section. If it is determined that a person is in violation of this subsection and a permit is denied for this reason, then 30 calendar days must elapse from the date of notification by certified mailing before a new application and fee may be resubmitted. 
                  (8)  All permits issued through administrative error can be terminated and seized by the chief of police or his/her designee or the city manager or his/her designee. 
                  (9)  Replacement permits will be issued within 30 days of the original date, upon paying one-half of the fee charged for employee pouring permits. A new application and fee must be submitted after 30 days from the original application date. 
                  (10)  All permits issued under this section remain the property of the city and shall be produced for inspection upon the demand of any officer or designee of the chief of police or the city code enforcement office. 
                  (11)  No licensee shall allow any employee or manager required to hold a permit to work on the premises unless the employee or manager has in his/her possession a current valid city employee pouring permit. For new employees, a receipt issued by the city may be used for a maximum of 30 days from the date of its issue. Licensees are required to inspect and verify that each employee required to do so has in his/her possession a valid current employee pouring permit. 
                  (12)  It shall be the duty of all persons holding any license to sell alcoholic beverages to file with the chief of police or his/her designee the name of the establishment, the license number and a list of employees, including home addresses and home telephone numbers, twice annually, during the month of June and again in the month of December. 
                  (13)  Any person, entity or license holder found in violation of this section may be fined in an amount not to exceed $500.00 for each separate offense. Also, any violation of this section may result in the revocation of any license or permit issued under this chapter.

                  (b)  Any hotel or motel that acquires in-room service shall also be required to obtain a consumption on-premises license and meet all of the requirements of this chapter. 
                  (c)  No hotel or motel shall be authorized to provide in-room service until it has been issued a special license to do so. A license fee of $100.00 shall be imposed to provide only beer and/or wine by in-room service. 
                  (d)  The sale of beer and/or wine by in-room service shall be subject to all restrictions and limitations relative to the retail sale of any alcoholic beverages, except as provided otherwise in this article.

                  (5)  Sell, offer to sell, or deliver alcoholic beverages, including malt beverages, in any container which holds more than 32 fluid ounces (0.947 liters), except to two or more persons at any one time; 
                  (6)  Increase the volume of alcohol contained in a drink without increasing proportionately the price regularly charged for such alcoholic beverage during the same calendar week; or 
                  (7)  Encourage or permit on the licensed premises any game or contest which involves the drinking of alcoholic beverages or the awarding of alcoholic beverages as a prize. 
                  (b)  Each licensee shall maintain a schedule of the prices charged for all alcoholic beverages to be served and consumed on the licensed premises or in any room or part thereof. The licensee shall not vary the schedule of prices from day to day or from hour to hour within a single day. The schedule of prices shall be effective for not less than one calendar week. 
                  (c)  No licensee shall advertise or promote in any way, whether within or without the licensed premises, any of the practices prohibited under subsection (a) of this section. 
                  (d)  No provision of this section shall be construed to prohibit licensees from offering free food or entertainment at any time, to prohibit licensees from including an alcoholic beverage as part of a meal package, or to prohibit the sale or delivery of wine by the bottle or carafe when sold with meals or to more than one person. 
                  (e)  The police department shall have responsibility for the enforcement of this section.

                  (1)  If the animal is not claimed by the owner within 72 hours of being telephoned or personally contacted or 72 hours of a notice being left at the owner's residence, the animal shall be deemed abandoned and representatives of the animal control shelter may at their discretion adopt such animal or dispose of such animal in accordance with state law. If the owner cannot be located or no residence of the owner identified, the animal shall be presumed abandoned within five days of impoundment. 
                  (2)  If any of the time periods in the subsection (1) of this section expire, the owner shall be deemed to have given his consent to the adoption of the impounded animal or to give his consent to the disposal of the animal in a humane fashion in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 4-11-5.1.

                  (3)  If an animal is impounded and through its appearance seems to have been abandoned or is stray, such animal will be kept for a period of five days before it will be considered for adoption or destroyed. The appearance of being abandoned or stray would include, but not be limited to, the following: no collar, tag, brand, microchipping or other identifiable marks, an appearance of being malnourished, excessively dirty or mange-like fur coat or any other condition that would lead the animal control officer to conclude that such animal is a stray.

The decreased rate of taxation may be given in successive years, depending on the amount of cost expended by the person(s) chargeable with payment of ad valorem taxes on the property to satisfy its remediation or redevelopment, with every $25,000.00 or portion thereof equaling one year of tax reduction; provided, however, that no property shall be entitled to reduction in city ad valorem taxes for more than four successive years.

The rental housing plans must be reviewed and approved by the city manager before work begins, and must be inspected after completion to ensure quality of work. 
                  (d)  To qualify, the new construction must either be in the opportunity zone or in a designated redevelopment corridor. Should a property owner elect to receive a lump sum payment for all such taxes which will be credited, the city will pay the property owner for all such real property taxes which the property owner will pay which are attributable to the qualifying new construction for a maximum period of three years, upon that owner's receipt of a certificate of occupancy for that newly constructed building or that area of the previously existing commercial building which was renovated, improved, and/or added.

                  Whereas, numerous instances involving the operation of billiard rooms after customarily accepted evening operating hours have resulted in disobedience to local and state law by billiard room operators and their patrons; 
                  Whereas, a large number of those involved were under the age of 18; 
                  Whereas, an alarming number of those involved were 16 years of age or younger; and 
                  Whereas, the predominant violation of law in such cases after the hour of midnight has involved late night abuse of alcohol and illegal substances by owners and patrons, including minors. 
                  It is the objective, purpose and intent of this division to more closely regulate the operation of billiard rooms and pool rooms and require their closing during hours customarily associated with closing hours of other businesses and in harmony with the generally accepted time cycle for the operation and function of home life, thereby improving supervision and guidance of children, reversing the deterioration of family values, strengthening family bonds, reducing juvenile delinquency, achieving a decrease in the number of violent acts of children, reducing truancy and deterring the development and growth of youth, gangs, resulting in the improvement of the security of, and preservation of the peace, health safety, comfort and general welfare of the citizens of the City of Cornelia.

                  ARTICLE IV. - MINORS 

                  Sec. 18-83. - Purpose and intent. 
                  Inasmuch as: 
                  (1)  In the city as elsewhere there have been many instances of diminished parental discipline and ineffective control and guidance of children resulting in an increase in violent acts by children, truancy, and a rapid development of youth gangs, all attributable in large measure to deterioration of family values; and 
                  (2)  Experience has clearly demonstrated that violent acts of children, truancy, and rapid expansion of youth gang membership result to a large degree from the freedom with which children are allowed to be away from home without parental supervision during times traditionally recognized to be those when they should be under the supervision and control of the persons having their custody; and 
                  (3)  It has been established elsewhere that these conditions can be relieved and in a measure prevented by the use of a youth curfew, with parents and other persons having custody being encouraged to cooperate therewith and increase guidance and control of their children, strengthening parental discipline and reinforcing family bonds; therefore: 
                  The objective, purpose and intent of this article is to precipitate improved supervision and guidance of children, reverse the deterioration of family values, and strengthen family bonds in order to reduce juvenile delinquency, achieve decreased numbers of violent acts of children, reduce truancy, deter the development and growth of youth gangs, and ultimately improve the health and morals of the persons affected hereby, with the result being improvement in the safety and well being of all citizens of the city.

As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
                  (2)  A discharge of storm water runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
                  (5)  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in section 20-22(c)(15)—(17), in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
                  (c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  (7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)  Land disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in section 20-22(b)(2) of this article; 
                  (15)  Except as provided in paragraph (16) and (17) of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or where bulkheads and sea walls are installed to prevent shoreline erosion on Lake Oconee and Lake Sinclair; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term 'ephemeral stream' means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow, Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of article 5, chapter 5 of title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.  No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (17)  There is established a 25-foot buffer along coastal marshlands, as measured horizontally from the coastal marshland-upland interface, as determined in accordance with Chapter 5 of Title 12 of this title, the "Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1970." And the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where an alteration within the buffer area has been authorized pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-286, for maintenance of any currently serviceable structure, landscaping, or hardscaping, including bridges, roads, parking lots, golf courses, golf cart paths, retaining walls, bulkheads, and patios; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, where a drainage structure or roadway drainage structure is constructed or maintained; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, on the landward side of any currently serviceable shoreline stabilization structure, or for the maintenance of any manmade storm water detention basin, golf course pond, or impoundment that is located entirely within the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. For the purposes of this paragraph maintenance shall be defined as actions necessary or appropriate for retaining or restoring a currently serviceable improvement to the specified operable condition to achieve its maximum useful life. Maintenance includes emergency reconstruction of recently damaged parts of a currently serviceable structure so long as it occurs within a reasonable period of time after damage occurs. Maintenance does not include any modification that changes the character, scope or size of the original design and serviceable shall be defined as usable in its current state or with minor maintenance but not so degraded as to essentially require reconstruction. 
                  a.  No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to crossings for utility lines that cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer, provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
                  c.  The buffer shall not apply to any land disturbing activity conducted pursuant to and in compliance with a valid and effective land disturbing permit issued subsequent to April 22, 2014, and prior to December 31, 2015; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented or any lot for which the preliminary plat has been approved prior to December 31, 2015 if roadways, bridges, or water and sewer lines have been extended to such lot prior to the effective date of this Act and if the requirement to maintain a 25-foot buffer would consume at least 18 percent of the high ground of the platted lot otherwise available for development; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
                  d.  Activities where the area within the buffer is not more than 500 square feet or that have a "minor buffer impact" as defined in [EPD Rule] 391-3-7.01(r), provided that the total area of buffer impacts is less than 5,000 square feet are deemed to have an approved buffer variance by rule. Bank stabilization structures are not eligible for coverage under the variance by rule and notification shall be made to the division at least 14 days prior to the commencement of land disturbing activities. 
                  (d)  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in section 20-22(b), (c) of this article. 
                  (e)  The fact that land disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
                  (Ord. No. 07-18-02, § IV, 8-7-2018) 
                  Sec. 20-23. - Application/permit process. 
                  (a)  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, storm water management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this ordinance [from which this article derived], and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
                  (b)  Application requirements. 
                  (1)  No person shall conduct any land disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of City of Cornelia without first obtaining a permit from the city planning department to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
                  (2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the city planning department and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in section 20-23(c) of this article. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of section 20-22(b) and (c) of this article will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7.10. 
                  (3)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9), (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  (4)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by section 20-22(c)(15)—(17) have been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per section 20-23(b)(6), have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
                  (5)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this article section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
                  (6)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  (c)  Plan requirements. 
                  (1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in section 20-22(b)(c) of this article, or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this article. The plan for the land disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and storm water management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
                  (2)  Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land disturbing activity was permitted. 
                  (d)  Permits. 
                  (1)  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
                  (2)  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this article, any variances required by section 20-22(15)—(17) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per section 20-23(b)(6) are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
                  (3)  Any land disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this article, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
                  (4)  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
                  (5)  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this article. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
                  (6)  The LIA may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(f)(1).

                  Sec. 20-24. - Inspection and enforcement. 
                  (a)  The city planning department will periodically inspect the sites of land disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article. 
                  (b)  The local issuing authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within 12 months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975. 
                  (c)  The city planning department shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this article, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land disturbing activities. 
                  (d)  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
                  (e)  The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as Local Issuing Authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). The district or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
                  (f)  The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.A.G. § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within 90 days after notification by the division, the division shall revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority.

                  (a)  Failure to obtain a permit for land disturbing activity. If any person commences any land disturbing activity requiring a land disturbing permit as prescribed in this article without first obtaining said permit, the person shall be subject to revocation of his business license, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a business and associated work activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. 
                  (b)  Stop work orders. 
                  (1)  For the first and second violations of the provisions of this article, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have five days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within five days, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a stop-work order requiring that land disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided, however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order in lieu of a warning; 
                  (2)  For a third and each subsequent violation, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order; and 
                  (3)  All stop-work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. 
                  (4)  When a violation in the form of taking action without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer, or significant amounts of sediment, as determined by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee, have been or are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained, a stop work order shall be issued by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee. All such stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop work orders shall apply to all land disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls. 
                  (c)  Bond forfeiture. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land disturbing activities has failed to comply with the approved plan, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to have forfeited his performance bond, if required to post one under the provisions of section 20-23(b)(6). The local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. 
                  (d)  Monetary penalties. Any person who violates any provisions of this article, or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant to this article, or who negligently or intentionally fails or refuses to comply with any final or emergency order of the director issued as provided in this article shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 per day. For the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this article, notwithstanding any provisions in any city charter to the contrary, municipal courts shall be authorized to impose penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Notwithstanding any limitation of law as to penalties which can be assessed for violations of county ordinances, any magistrate court or any other court of competent jurisdiction trying cases brought as violations of this article under county ordinances approved under this article shall be authorized to impose penalties for such violations not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Each day during which violation or failure or refusal to comply continues shall be a separate violation.

                  Sec. 20-56. - Authorization. 
                  Georgia Const. art. IX, § II and O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a), have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the City Commission of the City of Cornelia, Georgia, does ordain as follows: 
                  (Ord. No. 07-16-01, 8-2-2016) 
                  Sec. 20-57. - Findings of fact. 
                  (a)  The flood hazard areas of Cornelia, Georgia are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (b)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
                  (Ord. No. 07-16-01, 8-2-2016) 
                  Sec. 20-58. - Statement of purpose. 
                  It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; and 
                  (4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; 
                  (5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.

                  Sec. 20-59. - Objectives. 
                  The objectives of this article are: 
                  (1)  To protect human life and health; 
                  (2)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
                  (3)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; 
                  (4)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
                  (5)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
                  (6)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; and 
                  (7)  To insure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

                  DIVISION 4. - PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

                  Sec. 20-135. - General standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure. 
                  (2)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage. 
                  (3)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage. 
                  (4)  Elevated buildings. All new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater. 
                  a.  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
                  1.  Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
                  2.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and 
                  3.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both direction. 
                  b.  So as not to violate the "lowest floor" criteria of this article, the unfinished or flood resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area; and 
                  c.  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms. 
                  (5)  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
                  (6)  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces. 
                  (7)  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system. 
                  (8)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters. 
                  (9)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. 
                  (10)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure, which is not compliant with the provisions of this article, shall be undertaken only if the nonconformity is not furthered, extended or replaced.

                  Sec. 20-136. - Specific standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and/or substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and/or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of division 4, subsection 20-135(4), "Elevated buildings". 
                  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  (2)  Non-residential construction. New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH zones, may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in division 3, subsection 20-117(6). 
                  (3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
                  a.  All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on: (1) individual lots or parcels; (2) in new and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions; (3) in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions; or (4) on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  b.  Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
                  1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation, or 
                  2.  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
                  c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (referenced in subsection 20-135(6), above) 
                  d.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
                  1.  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; 
                  2.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions); or 
                  3.  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "new construction", including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsections (3)a. and c., above. 
                  (4)  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in division 2, section 20-86, are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. 
                  Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
                  b.  Only if subsection (4)a., above is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of division 4.

                  (b)  The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the city planner in the enforcement or administration of this article. 
                  (c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the board of adjustments may appeal such decision to the Superior Court of Habersham County, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1. 
                  (d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (g)  In reviewing such requests, the board of adjustments shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article.

                  Sec. 20-156. - Conditions for variances. 
                  (a)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  (1)  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
                  (2)  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  (3)  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  (b)  The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (c)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (d)  The city planner shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the federal emergency management agency upon request. 
                  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the board of adjustments may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

                  Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. (Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (NOTE: accessory structures are NOT exempt from any article requirements) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
                  Subdivision means the division of a single lot into two or more lots for the purpose of sale or development. 
                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
                  Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the "start of construction" of the improvement. NOTE: The market value of the structure should be: (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement; or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
                  For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include; (1) those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project; or (2) any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure". 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions means where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this article, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article. 
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  (4)  Mechanical systems. Utilities and mechanical systems not in conformance with the codes in effect at the time of construction of a building which create a serious threat of fire or threaten the safety of the occupants of the building. 
                  (Prior Code, § 30-5) 
                  Sec. 26-5. - Additions to existing building. 
                  Additions to an existing building shall comply with the applicable requirements of state and local laws, rules, regulations, codes, and standards for new construction. Such additions shall not impose loads, either vertical or horizontal, which would cause the existing building to be subjected to stresses exceeding those permitted under new construction. If the existing building does not comply with the standards provided in this chapter and the building inspector finds that the addition adversely affects the performance of the total building, the building inspector may require: 
                  (1)  The new addition to be separated from the existing structure by at least a two-hour firewall with openings therein properly protected;

                  (a)  A total change in the use or occupancy of an existing building which would cause a greater hazard to the public shall not be made unless such building is made to comply with the requirements of applicable state and local rules, regulations, codes, and standards for the new use or occupancy; provided, however, that the compliance alternative provisions of this chapter may be utilized by the building inspector or his/her designee where total or strict compliance with applicable state or local rules, regulations, codes, or standards is not practical. 
                  (b)  When the proposed use is of equal or lesser hazard, as determined by the building inspector or his/her designee, further compliance with any code for new construction is not required unless otherwise provided in this chapter. Alterations or repairs to an existing building or structure which do not adversely affect the performance of the building may be made with like materials. Any proposed change to the existing building or change in type of contents of the existing building shall not increase the fire hazard to adjacent buildings or structures. If the fire hazard to adjacent buildings or structures is increased, then requirements of applicable construction or fire safety codes for exterior walls shall apply.

                  c.  The application is for the demolition or relocation of a local historic property or a contributing or noncontributing building or structure in a local historic district, the demolition or relocation of which would have a substantial adverse effect on the local historic property or local historic district, but the replacement project is of special merit.

                  (j)  Historic preservation commission's denial of application binding upon building official.

                  (k)  Unreasonable economic hardship. 
                  (1)  Objective of unreasonable economic hardship provision.

In the event that any of the required information is not reasonably available to the applicant and cannot be obtained by the applicant, the applicant shall file with his affidavit a statement of the information that cannot be obtained and shall describe the reasons why such information cannot be obtained. 
                  (4)  Public hearings on applications for economic hardship variances. 
                  a.  The historic preservation commission shall schedule and hold a public hearing on the application for an economic hardship variance within 45 days after the filing thereof. Notice of the hearing shall be provided in accordance with subsection (e)(2) of this section.

Written notice of the determination shall be transmitted to the building official and, by United States Mail, to the applicant. 
                  b.  If the historic preservation commission determines that reasonable use or return remains, or the applicant fails to submit information to prove the claim, or the applicant simply refuses to comply with the commission's request for information necessary to make a determination, the application for an economic hardship variance shall be denied. A denial of the application shall be binding upon the building official and, in such a case; no building permit shall be issued. 
                  c.  If the historic preservation commission determines that it's previous denial of a certificate of appropriateness results in the loss of all reasonable use of or return from the subject property, it shall change the offending action by issuing a certificate of appropriateness, thereby allowing the proposed work to proceed. 
                  (l)  Requirement of conformance with certificate of appropriateness. 
                  (1)  All work performed pursuant to an issued certificate of appropriateness shall conform to the requirements of such certificate.

                  ARTICLE I. - SPEED CONTROL DEVICE PROGRAM 

                  Sec. 28-1. - Introduction and general standards. 
                  (a)  Function of the City of Cornelia Speed Control Device Program and ordinance. In response to numerous complaints about speeding problems in neighborhoods, the City of Cornelia has studied other similar communities and how those communities have addressed residential speeding problems. One popular and cost effective measure is the installation of speed control devices such as speed humps. When properly designed and installed, and with strong community support, speed control devices are effective at reducing speeds in neighborhoods. After much experimentation and testing, the use of speed control devices has been formally endorsed by transportation authorities worldwide. In the United States, a policy on the use of speed control devices has been developed by a special committee of the Institute of Transportation Engineers. The following program and ordinance has been established for the citizens of Cornelia who want to pursue the installation of speed control devices in their neighborhoods. 
                  (b)  Street classification. The City of Cornelia will only consider installation of speed control devices on streets classified as local, residential streets with a speed limit of 35 mph or less. Traffic studies may indicate that speed control devices would be unnecessary or unsafe at certain locations. Data obtained from traffic studies of physical and traffic related factors should be used in determining where speed control devices are appropriate. A preliminary field investigation performed by the city prior to the traffic study may find that speed control devices are not warranted due to existing conditions such as, but not limited to, horizontal and vertical alignment, sight distance, length and width of roadway. 
                  (c)  Legal authority. Speed control devices shall be placed only by the authority of the board of commissioners. 
                  (d)  Standardization of application. In keeping with the general recommendation of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD), uniformity aids in the recognition and understanding of traffic control devices. 1 Strict adherence to the standards and guidelines outlined in this article will help ensure that any given speed control device installation will be equally recognizable and require the same action on the part of the motorists regardless of where it is encountered. 
                  (Ord. No. 08-15-01, 9-1-2015) 
                  Note— 1 MUTCD, current edition, U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration. 
                  Sec. 28-2. - Program elements. 
                  (a)  Initial request from community. The process for speed control device installation begins with a letter from the community desiring speed control devices requesting a traffic study by the city. Such letter (the "initial request") should come from a community representative, homeowners' association, or individual that certifies that the request is on behalf of at least a majority of the lot owners in the subject area (such initial request need not contain signatures of the majority of lot owners; rather the individual submitting the initial request must certify that the request is on behalf of a majority of lot owners). Following receipt of the initial request, the city will perform a preliminary field inspection. If the street, grade and other fixed factors do not meet the necessary requirements for speed control devices, the initial request will fail and no further action will be taken. If the street, grade and other fixed factors qualify for the speed control device program, the department will notify the person or persons who submitted the initial request. Then the department shall conduct a traffic study to determine whether the subject street meets the hereinbelow established criteria. 
                  (b)  Speed criteria. Traffic studies must find that a speeding problem exists based on the standard of an 85th percentile speed of at least five mph over the posted speed limit. The 85th percentile speed is an excellent indicator of street character. 
                  (1)  Below speed criteria. Since research has determined that speed control devices reduce 85th percentile speeds, installing humps on streets with an 85th percentile below criteria speed does not meet generally accepted cost/benefit ratios, and is not recommended. Streets with 85th percentile speeds less than five mph over the posted speed limit will not be considered for the speed control device program. 
                  (2)  Speed criteria. The City of Cornelia recommends limiting the use of speed control devices to residential streets where excessive speeding can be documented. Streets with 85th percentile speeds ten mph over the posted speed limit will require a 70 percent approval of the homeowners in the defined service area, via. 
                  (c)  Speed control device proposal. City personnel will create a speed control device proposal by planning the placement of speed control device on streets meeting program criteria using the following guidelines: 
                  (1)  Grade. Speed control devices should not be installed on street sections with grades greater than eight percent. 
                  (2)  Number of devices in a series. Speed control devices are not to be used to slow traffic at a given "point," but rather to reinforce a safe speed along a street or street section. Usually, a series of devices should not be placed within three-quarters of a mile of each other. If the street or section of street on which the proposed speed control device will be located exceeds one mile, speed control devices can be used in conjunction with other traffic calming devices, such as traffic circles and stop signs, thus reducing the number of speed control devices necessary to achieve targeted speed reduction. 
                  (3)  Location. The first traffic control device in a series should normally be placed in a position where it cannot be approached at high speed from either direction. To achieve this objective, the first traffic control device in a series is typically installed within 100 and 200 feet of a small-radius curve or stop sign. Care should be taken so that traffic control devices are not placed in a location that impedes or impairs access to any utility, manhole cover, and/or driveway cuts. 
                  (d)  Petition for speed humps. Upon request, the city will forward the speed control device proposal, along with petition forms, to the homeowners' representative. Property owners, who are interested in pursuing the installation of speed control devices, shall submit to the city a petition cover letter and a petition form. The following rules and requirements, which will be included with the petition forms, help ensure the fairness and integrity of the petition process: 
                  (1)  The objective of the City of Cornelia Speed Control Device Program is to provide a process pursuant to which speed control devices are installed on city maintained neighborhood roads, where studies indicate that their use would meet the desired results of reducing neighborhood speeds and their installation is favored by a majority of the property owners in the area. 
                  (2)  To have speed control devices installed in the City of Cornelia, a petition must be submitted to the city. All of the property owners in the designated area should be contacted and given an opportunity to sign the petition, indicating their approval or disapproval concerning the installation of speed control devices in the proposed location. Only the signature of the legal owner of the property will be proper for purposes of the petition. If both husband and wife are joint legal owners, both signatures are required. A "Mr. and Mrs." signature is not acceptable. All property owners must sign individually, including the owners of undeveloped lots. The signature of tenants to the property shall not be acceptable. No signature will be withdrawn from the petition after it is filed with the city. The percentages will be calculated, based on individual lots where owners sign affirmatively, divided by the total number of lots in the designated area. Each lot shall count as one vote, regardless of the number of owners signing the petition for that lot. 
                  (3)  The completed petition must be signed, by an authorized representative of the subdivision, notarized, and then returned to the city, where it will be checked against tax records and land lot maps to insure that it meets all requirements. It will be returned to the sender if it does not meet the requirements. Petitions that do meet the requirements will be presented to the commissioners at a public meeting. In the case of a petition that fails to meet the requirements set forth herein, property owners must wait one year from the date of the initial request before requesting another study of that same street(s). 
                  (e)  Public hearing before board of commissioners. A public hearing before the board of commissioners will be announced following submission of a petition meeting the requirements set forth in subsection (d) above. At the public hearing, the petition will be approved or disapproved by the board of commissioners in their sole discretion and contingent upon availability of funds for this purpose. 
                  (f)  Miscellaneous program provisions. 
                  (1)  The time span from receiving the petition to installation of the speed control device will be no more than six months. It is recognized, however, that factors beyond the city's control may delay the installation of the speed control device. 
                  (2)  The city shall remove speed humps only under the following conditions: 
                  a.  A formal petition in the form prescribed above shall be filed with the commission indicating that 75 percent of the property owners request the removal of the speed control device. In the event the local residential street is not completely built out, a minimum of 60 percent of the number of residences must be occupied before a petition for the removal of speed control devices will be considered; 
                  b.  The petition shall contain a statement acknowledging that the property owners are aware of the probability that vehicular traffic speeds on their street may increase after the speed control devices are removed; and 
                  c.  The speed control devices shall not have been installed less than one year from the date of receipt of the petition.

                  (Prior Code, § 21-36) 
                  Sec. 40-31. - National categorical pretreatment standards. 
                  The categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR 405—471 are hereby incorporated into this chapter by reference. 
                  (1)  Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the pretreatment coordinator may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(c). 
                  (2)  When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the pretreatment coordinator shall impose an alternate limit using the combined wastestream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e). 
                  (3)  A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard if the user can prove, pursuant to the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13, that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by the EPA when developing the categorical pretreatment standard. 
                  (4)  A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15. 
                  (Prior Code, ch. 50, § 2.2; Ord. of 6-1-2003) 
                  Sec. 40-32. - Local limits. 
                  The city is required to develop and enforce "local limits" governing the quality and quantity of user discharges to the city's POTW. The city has established limits for a number of critical pollutants based on the operating limitations of the POTW, NPDES permit requirements, receiving stream water quality standards, sludge disposal requirements, and POTW worker safety. Background loadings for the domestic and commercial loadings were based on locally collected data where possible, otherwise EPA data was used. Maximum industrial discharge concentrations were derived for various pollutants to accomplish the above requirements to protect human health and the local environment. Discharges to the POTW containing pollutants in concentrations in excess of the values shown in Table 2.3 are prohibited. 
                  (1)  Because plant operation characteristics can change and state and federal standards for water quality are subject to change, the local limits are also subject to revision. Therefore, the city reserves the right to revise a user's discharge permit to restrict the volume or mass of particular pollutants previously permitted. If necessary, the city has the right to revoke a user's permit if such discharge would result in a direct or indirect violation of state or federal standards by the POTW. 
                  (2)  Local limits have been calculated in accordance with the above considerations and are provided in Table 2-3 below: 
                  TABLE 2-3. LOCAL LIMITS 

                   
                  * Equivalent mass-based limits may be imposed at the city's discretion. 
                  ** 100 mg/l for establishments with grease interceptors/traps. 
                  NOTE: All metals are "total" metals unless otherwise specified.

                  Sec. 40-33. - City's right of revision. 
                  The city reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or in wastewater discharge permits, more stringent standards or requirements than the provisions of this chapter, including the National Categorical Pretreatment Standards.

                  Sec. 40-34. - Dilution. 
                  No user shall ever increase the use of process water or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The pretreatment coordinator may impose mass limitations on users who are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is deemed to be appropriate.

                  Sec. 40-35. - Construction standards. 
                  (a)  General. The size, slope, alignment, materials of construction, methods used in excavating and placing the pipe, jointing, testing and backfilling the trench for building sewers, shall all conform to local building codes, plumbing codes and all other applicable requirements of the city. In cases of conflict or in the absence of guiding provisions, materials and procedures set forth in the ASTM and Water Pollution Control Federation Manual of Practice No. 9 shall govern. All joints of the building sewer shall be tight and waterproof. No installation of pipe or other materials for sewer extensions shall be allowed until required information is received and the design is approved by the city. Additionally, the following materials and methods shall apply to building sewers within the city's supervision: 
                  (1)  The building sewer shall be ductile iron pipe, American National Standards Institute (ANSI) specification A21.51, latest revision, or equal; or polyvinyl chloride (PVC) sewer pipe, ASTM specification D3034, latest revision. All joints shall be tight and waterproof. 
                  (2)  Any part of the building sewer that is located within ten feet of a water service pipe shall be constructed of ductile iron pipe. Bolted mechanical joints may be required by the superintendent where the sewer is exposed to damage by tree roots. If installed in filled or unstable ground, the building sewer shall be of cast iron soil pipe, except that plastic pipe may be acceptable if laid on a suitable concrete bed or cradle, as approved by the city. 
                  (3)  The size and slope of the building sewer shall be subject to the approval of the city, but in no event shall the diameter be less than four inches. The slope of such four inch pipe shall not be less than one-eighth inch per foot. Furthermore, the appropriate requirements of the Occupational Health and Safety Act (OSHA) shall be followed. 
                  (4)  The depth shall be sufficient to afford protection from frost, and the building sewer shall be laid at uniform grade and with straight alignment insofar as possible. Changes in direction shall be made only with properly curved pipe and fittings. Building sewers shall not be placed in the same trench with water service lines. 
                  (5)  An excavation required for the installation of a building sewer shall be open-trench work unless otherwise approved by the city. Pipe laying and backfill shall be performed in accordance with ASTM specification C12, latest revision, except that no backfill shall be placed until the work has been inspected and approved. 
                  (6)  All joints and connections shall be made gastight and watertight. Push-on joints for ductile iron pipe shall also have neoprene gaskets and be installed according to the manufacturer's recommendations. PVC pipe joint material shall be of the bell and spigot type, sealed with a rubber O-ring gasket, having a composition and texture which is resistant to the common ingredients of sewage, industrial wastes (including oils), and groundwater, and which will endure permanently under the conditions likely to be imposed by this use. Installation of a gasket shall be done in accordance with the pipe manufacturer's instructions using all the necessary materials, lubricants, and equipment recommended by the manufacturer. Other jointing materials may be used only when approved by the city. 
                  (7)  The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall be made at the Y-branch, if such a branch is available at a suitable location. If the public sewer is 12 inches in diameter or less and no properly located Y-branch is available, the city shall, at the owner's expense, cut a neat hole into the public sewer, with entry in the downstream direction at an angle of about 45 degrees, and install a 45-degree elbow with the spigot end cut so as not to extend past the inner surface of the public sewer. The invert of the building sewer at the point of connection shall be at an elevation of at least 0.1 feet above the invert of the public sewer. A neat, smooth joint shall be made, and the connection shall be made secure and watertight by encasement in concrete. Special fittings may be used for the connection only when approved by the city. 
                  (b)  Prohibitions. No building sewers shall be connected to a sanitary sewer until drawings are received and until the extension has been inspected, tested, and accepted by the city. Groundwater, rainwater, mud, and gravel shall be kept out of the sanitary sewer system at all times, including during construction. 
                  (c)  Other regulations. Design and construction of sanitary sewer extensions shall comply with all local, state, and federal rules and regulations pertaining to sewer installation, including, but not limited to, rules and regulations for safety, erosion and sediment control, stream buffer protections, wetlands, and water quality standards.

                  Sec. 40-181. - Periodic compliance reports. 
                  (a)  Both categorical industrial users and significant industrial users shall, at a frequency specified by the user's permit, but in no case less than twice per year (in June and December), submit a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by pretreatment standards and local permit limits and the measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with section 40-112. 
                  (b)  All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
                  (c)  If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the pretreatment coordinator, using the procedures prescribed in section 40-188, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report.

                  Sec. 40-185. - Notice of violation; repeat sampling and reporting. 
                  If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must verbally notify the pretreatment coordinator within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the pretreatment coordinator within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. The pretreatment coordinator has the authority to waive resampling requirements if the pretreatment coordinator monitors the wastewater discharge at the user's facility at least once a month, or if the pretreatment coordinator samples between the user's initial sampling and when the user receives the results of this sampling. 
                  (Prior Code, ch. 50, § 6.8; Ord. of 6-1-2003) 
                  Sec. 40-186. - Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste. 
                  (a)  Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA regional waste management division director, and the state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain, to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user, an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this subsection need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under section 40-182. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of sections 40-178, 40-180, and 40-181. 
                  (b)  Discharges are exempt from the requirements of subsection (a) of this section during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e) requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
                  (c)  In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of RCRA, identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the pretreatment coordinator, the EPA regional waste management waste division director, and the state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations. 
                  (d)  In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
                  (e)  This section does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this chapter, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.

                  (a)  Except as indicated in subsection (b) of this section, the user must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is unfeasible, the pretreatment coordinator may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits. 
                  (b)  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques.

                  The city shall have the right to enter the premises of any user to determine whether the user is complying with all requirements of this chapter and any wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder. Users shall allow the city ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties. 
                  (1)  Where a user has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, the city will be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities. 
                  (2)  The city shall have the right to set up on the user's property or require installation of such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's operations. 
                  (3)  The pretreatment coordinator may require the user to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated annually to ensure their accuracy. 
                  (4)  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user at the written or verbal request of the city and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the user. 
                  (5)  Unreasonable delays in allowing the city access to the user's premises shall be a violation of this chapter.

                  (2)  Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. 
                  (b)  Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against or a prerequisite for taking any other action against the user.

                  (a)  When the city finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued thereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city may fine such user in an amount not to exceed $1,000.00 per day. Such fines shall be assessed on a per violation, per day basis. In the case of monthly or other longterm average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation. 
                  (b)  Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after 60 calendar days, be assessed an additional penalty of ten percent of the unpaid balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of 1½ per month. A lien against the user's property will be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties. 
                  (c)  Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for the city to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount within 30 days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit, the city will hear the matter at a regular or called commission meeting. In the event the user's appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user. The city may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine. 
                  (d)  Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against or a prerequisite for taking any other action against the user.

                  Sec. 40-289. - Emergency suspensions. 
                  (a)  The city may immediately suspend a user's discharge after informal notice to the user whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The city may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment. 
                  (1)  Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event a user fails to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the city may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The city may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the city that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in section 40-290 are initiated against the user. 
                  (2)  A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the pretreatment coordinator prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under sections 40-285 or 40-290. 
                  (b)  Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section.

                  (a)  In addition to the provisions in section 40-145, any user who violates the following conditions is subject to discharge termination: 
                  (1)  Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions; 
                  (2)  Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge; 
                  (3)  Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge; 
                  (4)  Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or 
                  (5)  Violation of the pretreatment standards in article II of this chapter. 
                  (b)  Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under section 40-285 why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the city shall not be a bar to or a prerequisite for taking any other action against the user.

                  Sec. 40-369. - Upset. 
                  (a)  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Upset means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. The term "upset" does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
                  (b)  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection (c) of this section are met. 
                  (c)  A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
                  (1)  An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause of the upset; 
                  (2)  The facility was, at the time, being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 
                  (3)  The user has submitted the following information to the pretreatment coordinator within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days): 
                  a.  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
                  b.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
                  c.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
                  (d)  In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
                  (e)  Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
                  (f)  Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails.

                  A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in section 40-27(a) or the specific prohibitions in sections 40-27(b)(3) through (b)(7) if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either: 
                  (1)  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or 
                  (2)  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.

                  (a)  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Bypass means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a user's treatment facility. 
                  Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resource which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. The term "severe property damage" does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
                  (b)  A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsections (c) and (d) of this section. 
                  (c)  If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the pretreatment coordinator, at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible. A user shall submit oral notice to the pretreatment coordinator of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The pretreatment coordinator may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours. 
                  (d)  Bypass is prohibited, and the city may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless: 
                  (1)  The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
                  (2)  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime; provided, however, that this condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
                  (3)  The user submitted notices as required under subsection (c) of this section. 
                  (e)  The pretreatment coordinator may approve an anticipated bypass after considering its adverse effects if he/she determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsections (d)(1) through (d)(3) of this section.

                  All users discharging "high strength" wastewater into the city wastewater system shall be assessed a monetary surcharge, in addition to the normally required sewer use charges, in an amount to be calculated as shown below. The surchargable parameters shall be determined by the utilization of the sampling and testing procedures as provided in section 40-424. A "high strength" wastewater is defined as wastewater which contains pollutant concentrations that exceed the following surcharge threshold concentrations: 

                   
                  (Prior Code, ch. 50, § 14.1; Ord. of 6-1-2003; Ord. of 12-4-2007; Ord. of 5-5-2009)

                  When the concentrations of the surcharged parameters shown above exceed the values of the constituents as set forth in section 40-422, above, the excess concentrations shall be subject to a surcharge in the amount derived in accordance with the following formula: 

                   
                  Where: 
                  (1)  "P" is equal to the average concentration in mg/l of the parameter being evaluated (BOD, TSS, TKN or P) as established in accordance with section 40-424 of this division. The surcharge is for pollutants in excess of the amounts established by the city in accordance with section 40-426 of this division. 
                  (2)  "G" is equal to the user's monthly water consumption in thousands of gallons as determined in accordance with section 40-425 of this division. 
                  (3)  "8.34" is a conversion factor. 
                  (4)  "C" is equal to the unit cost in dollars per pound ($/lb) for the treatment of the surcharged parameters. This value shall be established by the city and revised from time to time as necessary in accordance with section 40-426 of this division. The value of C shall be: 

                   
                  (Prior Code, ch. 50, § 14.2; Ord. of 6-1-2003; Ord. of 12-4-2007; Ord. of 5-5-2009) 
                  Sec. 40-424. - Quantitative measurement of surchargable parameters. 
                  The measurement of the surcharge parameters shall be conducted as follows: 
                  (1)  To the extent that the DMRs submitted monthly by a user indicate that the surcharge concentrations set forth in section 40-422 have been exceeded, the user will pay for the excess concentrations indicated on the DMRs for the month submitted in accordance with section 40-423, so long as the concentrations submitted in the DMRs are greater than the concentrations determined in subsection (2), below. 
                  (2)  The city will establish surcharge concentrations as described below: 
                  a.  Unless a user has indicated on the wastewater permit application, or otherwise demonstrated that seasonal or otherwise predictable fluctuations may occur, the city shall sample and test the user not less than twice per year, except that the duration of the sampling to determine surcharges shall be for a period of not less than three consecutive calendar days. However, the city may sample as often as monthly to establish surcharge levels. Such sampling shall be for three consecutive days (as described above) and shall set the user's surcharge concentrations for the ensuing six months, or until the next official three-day city sampling event, whichever is less. Procedures regarding collection of "representative" samples are provided in subsections e. and f. hereafter. 
                  b.  A 24-hour composite sample shall be collected over three consecutive days. Samples shall be taken in increments of not more than one hour, properly refrigerated and composited in proportion to the time (a "time-proportioned" sample) for a representative sample. If a flow monitoring structure is available, or required by the city, flow-weighted samples may be collected in lieu of time-weighted samples. The city will "split" these three samples with the user being sampled if so requested by the user. Should the difference between the city's sample and the user's spilt sample be greater than 20 percent for any parameter tested, an automatic resampling will be required. The city and the user shall split the cost of testing of resamples that are taken as a result of the 20 percent discrepancy. 
                  c.  All wastewater monitoring samples required by the city shall be tested by an independent laboratory using acceptable procedures in accordance with 40 CFR 136. 
                  d.  The city need not provide any prior notice to the industry with regard to the sampling period. 
                  e.  The city may sample the user as often as desired at the city's expense if, in the opinion of the city, representative samples have not been previously obtained. However, the official three-day city sampling event for establishing surcharge concentrations shall be no more often than monthly. 
                  f.  If in the opinion of the user, the samples taken by the city are not representative of the user's typical wastewater, then the user may request a resampling. At the user's request, the city shall grant the user not more than 12 monthly resamplings per calendar year. All user requested resampling shall be done at the user's expense. A reasonable cost shall be charged to the user by the city therefore. 
                  g.  The surcharge rate shall be established based on the three-day average concentration for each surchargable parameter identified in accordance with subsections a.—f. of this section. The average concentration will be used in the formula in section 40-423 above. Surcharge rates per unit mass will be established in accordance with section 40-426 below. 
                  (3)  The city will transmit the results of all sampling events which give rise to new surcharge values to the user for review prior to implementation of the new surcharge rates.

                  Sec. 40-425. - Determination of wastewater volume. 
                  Unless otherwise provided, the volume of wastewater delivered to the POTW will be based upon the quantity of water purchased from and metered by the city. If the volume of water delivered to the POTW is greater or less than the volume purchased from the city, the user shall make known to the city such differences. If differences do exist, it shall be the obligation of the user to install city approved meters or other devices to determine the portion or quantity of wastewater delivered to the POTW. At locations readily accessible for meter reading by the city, separate water meters installed in the city right-of-way are preferred for measuring non-sewered consumptive water usage. The city may consider establishing a constant ratio, factor, or percentage to be applied to the metered water quantity delivered by the water industry. Determining, as well as justifying, the factor to the city will be the responsibility of the user. The value of this factor may be periodically reviewed for accuracy by the city. Other methods may be established by the city to estimate the quantity of wastewater released to the sanitary sewer which considers the amount of water consumed during different seasons. Users that claim wastewater volumes to be inaccurately determined by these methods shall bear the expense of installing city approved meters to estimate flows to the POTW more accurately. 
                  In order to promote water conservation, the surcharge threshold values (as shown in section 40-422 and subsection 40-423(4)) shall be increased by an amount proportional to the industrial user's wastewater flow rate plus the recycle flow rate, all divided by the wastewater flow rate, for all industrial users subject to surcharges who internally recycle process water. In order to obtain this surcharge variance for recycling process water, the industrial user must measure the recycle flow in a manner acceptable to the city and report the documented recycle flow rate monthly on the industrial user's discharge monitoring report.

                  The city has the authority to collect fees and surcharges necessary to implement this SUO. The city shall elsewhere maintain a list of fees and surcharges required under the terms of this SUO. Limits and fees may be modified from time to time and may change without notice to users. This list shall be available for review or copying from city hall, the utility director, or the pretreatment coordinator upon written request.

                  Pollution means the presence of any foreign substance in water that tends to degrade its quality so as to constitute a non-health hazard or impair the usefulness of the water. 
                  Reduced-pressure backflow-prevention assembly means the approved reduced-pressure principle backflow-prevention assembly consists of two independently acting approved check valves together with hydraulically operating, mechanically independent pressure differential relief valve located between the check valves and below the first check valve. These units are located between two tightly closing resilient-seated shutoff valves as an assembly and equipped with properly located resilient-seated test cocks. 
                  Service connection means the terminal end of a service connection from the public potable water system, that is, where the water purveyor loses jurisdiction and sanitary control over the water at its point of delivery to the customer's water system. If a meter is installed at the end of the service connection, then the service connection shall mean the down-stream end of the meter. There should be no unprotected takeoffs from the service line ahead of any meter or backflow-prevention assembly located at the point of delivery to the customer's water system. Service connection shall also include water service connection from a fire hydrant and all other temporary or emergency water service connections from the public potable water system. 
                  Water commissioner or health official means the utilities director in charge of the water department of the city is vested with the authority and responsibility for the implementation of an effective cross-connection control program and for the enforcement of the provisions of this article. 
                  Water—Nonpotable means water that is not safe for human consumption or that is of questionable quality. 
                  Water—Potable means water that is safe for human consumption as described by the public health authority having jurisdiction. 
                  Water used means any water supplied by a water purveyor from a public potable water system to a consumer's water system after it has passed through the point of delivery and is no longer under the sanitary control of the water purveyor.

                  Testing laboratories, other than the laboratory listed above, will be added to an approved list as they are qualified by the city. 
                  Backflow preventers that may be subjected to backpressure or backsiphonage that have been fully tested and have been granted a certificate of approval by said quailifed laboratory and are listed on the laboratory's current list of approved backflow-prevention assemblies may be used without futher testing or qualification. 
                  (6)  It shall be the duty of the customer-user at any premises where backflow-prevention assemblies are installed to have certified inspections and operational tests made at least once per year. In those instances where the city deems the hazard to be great enough, certifed inspections may be required at more frequent intervals. These inspections and tests shall be at the expense of the water user and shall be performed by the assembly manufacturer's representative, or by a certifed tester approved by the city. It shall be the duty of the city to see that these tests are made in a timely manner. The customer-user shall notify the city in advance when the tests are to be undertaken so that the customer-user may witness the tests if so desired. These assemblies shall be repaired, overhauled, replaced at the expense of the customer-user whenever said assemblies are found to be defective. Records of such tests, repairs, and overhaul shall be kept and made available to the city. 
                  (7)  All presently installed backflow-prevention assembles that do not meet the requirements of this section but were approved assemblies for the purpose described herein at the time of installation and that have been properly maintained, shall, except for the inspection and maintenance requirements under subsection (3)6., be excluded from the requirements of these rules so long as the city is assured that they will satisfactorily protect the utility system. Whenever the existing assembly is moved from the present location, requires more than minimum maintenance, or when the city finds the maintenance constitutes a hazard to health, the unit shall be replaced by an approved backflow-prevention assembly meeting the requirements of this section.

                  a.  May cause erosion of lands, threaten businesses and residences, and other facilities with water damage and may environmentally impair the rivers, streams and other bodies of water within and downstream of the city. 
                  b.  Can adversely affect the operations of the sanitary sewer system operated by the City of Cornelia thereby increasing the likelihood of infiltration and inflow into the sanitary sewer system. 
                  c.  Contributes to the potential degradation of both the surface water and groundwater quality in area waterbodies. 
                  (6)  The city presently owns and operates stormwater management systems and facilities, which have been developed over many years. The future usefulness and operational function of the existing stormwater management systems and facilities owned and operated by the city, and the additions and improvements thereto, rests on the ability of the city to effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use, and enhance stormwater systems and facilities within the city in concert with the management of other water resources within the city. In order to do so, the city must have both a comprehensive stormwater management program as well as an adequate and stable funding source for its comprehensive program operation and drainage-related capital improvement needs. 
                  (7)  The city desires to provide enhanced management of stormwater runoff quality and quantity to mitigate the impacts of pollution and flooding which may impact the public municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4), private property and downstream receiving waters of the State of Georgia and/or United States. Therefore, it is appropriate for the city to establish a stormwater utility and impose a stormwater user fee charge upon all improved properties that may discharge, directly or indirectly, into the public MS4 and stormwater conveyance system, whether the property is private or public in nature. 
                  (8)  Compliance with the obligations of the city stormwater program activities will affect the cost of providing stormwater management services, systems and facilities above what is currently being spent for water quality management, drainage system maintenance, flood control and other program activities. 
                  (9)  The cost of operating and maintaining the city's stormwater management system and financing necessary repairs, replacements, improvements and extensions thereof should, to the extent practicable, be allocated in relationship to the services received from the system. 
                  (10)  The professional engineering analysis and related documents prepared by the city's consulting stormwater experts properly assesses and defines the city's stormwater management program problems, needs, goals, priorities as well as the stormwater management program funding strategy. 
                  (11)  Given the stormwater management program problems, needs, goals, priorities and funding strategy identified in the aforementioned professional engineering and financing analysis, it is appropriate to authorize the formation of an organizational and accounting entity dedicated specifically to the management, maintenance, protection, control, regulation, use, and enhancement of stormwater management services, systems and facilities within the city in concert with other water resource management programs. 
                  (12)  Stormwater management is applicable and needed throughout the incorporated areas of the city. While specific service and facility demands may differ from area to area at any given point in time, a stormwater management system and service area encompassing all lands and water bodies within the incorporated areas of the city is consistent with the present and future needs of the community. 
                  (13)  Provision of stormwater management services renders and/or results in both a service to customers and at least some benefit to all properties, property owners, citizens, and residents of the city, although the benefits may be indirect or immeasurable. 
                  (14)  The stormwater management services rendered may differ depending on many factors and considerations, including but not limited to location, demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater management systems and programs, and risk exposure. It is practical and equitable to allocate the cost of stormwater management among the owners of improved properties in proportion to the long term demands the properties impose on the city's stormwater management services which result in services to such properties and the owners thereof. 
                  (15)  A stormwater management program (hereinafter "SWMP") provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering stormwater management services throughout the city, and the most equitable means to regulate the use of a higher level of stormwater management services within the city through stormwater user fee charges, user fees and other mechanisms. 
                  (16)  The area of impervious surfaces on each improved property is the most important factor influencing the cost of the stormwater management services provided by the city or to be provided by the city in the future, and the area of impervious surfaces on each property is therefore the most appropriate parameter for calculating a periodic stormwater user fee charge. 
                  (17)  A schedule of stormwater utility user fee charges based in part on the area of impervious surface located on each improved property is the most appropriate and equitable means of allocating the cost of stormwater management services throughout the city. Such user fee charges may be complemented by other types of charges which address specific needs, including, but not limited to, special service fees, special assessments, revenue bonds, use of proceeds from special purpose local option sales taxes and other forms of revenue, as deemed appropriate by the mayor and city commission. 
                  (18)  The existence of privately owned and maintained on-site or off-site systems, facilities, activities or assets which reduce or otherwise mitigate the impact of a particular property on the city's SWMP, and the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and/or stormwater management systems and facilities, should be taken into account to reduce the user fee charge on that property either in the form of a direct reduction or a credit, and such reduction or credit should be conditioned upon continuing provision of such services, systems, facilities, activities or assets in a manner complying with the standards and codes as determined by the stormwater utility manager. Reductions or credits for privately owned and maintained stormwater management systems, facilities, activities or assets shall be generally proportional to the affect that such systems have on the peak rate of runoff from the property. 
                  (19)  It is imperative that the proceeds from all user fee charges for stormwater management services, systems or facilities, together with any other revenues raised or otherwise allocated specifically to stormwater management services, systems or facilities, be dedicated solely to those purposes, and such proceeds of user fee charges and revenues shall therefore be deposited into the enterprise accounting fund of the city stormwater utility and shall remain in that fund and be dispersed only for stormwater management capital, operating and non-operating costs, lease payments and debt service of bonds or other indebtedness for stormwater management purposes.

                  Detached single-family residential property or DSFR means improved property containing one residential structure which is not attached to another dwelling, and which contains one or more bedrooms, with bathroom and kitchen facilities, designed for occupancy by one family. A detached single-family residential property may include a "stick-built," industrialized, or manufactured home located on one or more individual lots or parcels of land. Improved property may be classified as a detached single-family residential property even if there is present incidental structures associated with residential uses such as garages, carports, storage buildings, guest houses, servants or caretakers quarters, cottages or barns, or the presence of a commercial use within the residence, as long as such use does not result in additional areas of impervious surfaces. Detached single-family residential properties shall not include improved property containing structures used primarily for nonresidential purposes, manufactured homes located within manufactured home parks where the land is owned by someone other than the owners of the manufactured homes, or multiple dwelling unit residential properties. 
                  Dwelling unit shall mean a structure, which contains one or more bedrooms, a bathroom and a kitchen facility. 
                  Equivalent residential unit (ERU ) means the stormwater user fee charge billing unit increment related to the median horizontal impervious surface area footprint of 3,300 square feet for a typical single-family dwelling unit within the city. 
                  Hydrologic response defines the manner and means whereby stormwater collects, remains, infiltrates, and is conveyed from a property. Hydrologic response is dependent on several factors including, but not limited to, the presence of impervious surface, the parcel's size, the parcel's shape, the parcel's vegetative canopy, the parcel's groundwater, the parcel's antecedent moisture and the parcel's geologic condition. 
                  Impervious area shall mean the area, usually expressed in square feet, that is covered by an impervious surface. 
                  Impervious surface means those areas which prevent or impede the infiltration of stormwater into the soil in the manner in which it entered the soil, in natural conditions, prior to development. Common impervious surfaces include, but are not limited to, rooftops, buildings or structures, sidewalks, walkways, patio areas, driveways, parking lots, storage areas, awnings and other fabric or plastic coverings, and other surfaces which prevent or impede the natural infiltration of stormwater runoff which existed prior to development. 
                  Improved property means property altered from its natural state by construction or installation of 500 square feet or more of impervious surfaces. 
                  Non-single-family residential property or NSFR means improved property containing multiple dwelling unit residential properties, condominiums, apartments, commercial and office buildings, public buildings and structures, industrial and manufacturing buildings, storage buildings and storage areas, parking lots, parks, recreation properties, tennis courts, swimming pools, public and private schools and universities, research facilities and stations, hospitals and convalescent centers, airports, agricultural uses, water and wastewater treatment plants, and any other form of use not otherwise mentioned which is not a detached single-family residential (hereinafter "DSFR"), or attached residential (hereinafter "AR") property, and which has private parking lots and private drives or roads. 
                  Public water influence zone means those areas lying downstream of a culvert, or other stormwater management conveyance system. On the downstream side of the conveyance system, the public water influence zone will extend for a length of six times the diameter (or width) of the culvert from which runoff is being discharged (Field Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia, Third Edition, pg. 99), and within the horizontal limits set forth in the aforementioned field manual. For example, if a 48-inch diameter culvert is discharging to a private property, the public water influence zone shall extend 24 feet (six times 48-inches) from the end of the culvert and for the specified width (i.e. typically the width of the creek). The Cornelia Stormwater Utility may perform maintenance and/or capital construction activities only within that portion of the public water influence zone which the city has an ownership interest in, or for which a dedicated easement has been granted to, and accepted by the city for such purpose. 
                  Service area means the entire land area within the corporate limits of the city. 
                  Stormwater management services mean all services provided by the city which relate to the: 
                  (1)  Transfer, control, conveyance or movement of stormwater runoff through the incorporated portions of the city; 
                  (2)  Maintenance, repair and replacement of existing stormwater management systems and facilities; 
                  (3)  Planning, development, design and construction of additional stormwater management systems and facilities to meet current and anticipated needs;

                  (5)  Compliance with applicable state and federal stormwater management regulations and permit requirements. Stormwater management services may address the quality of stormwater runoff as well as the quantity thereof. 
                  Stormwater management systems and facilities means those natural and manmade channels, swales, ditches, rivers, streams, creeks, branches, reservoirs, ponds, drainage ways, inlets, catch basins, pipes, headwalls, storm sewers, lakes and other physical works, properties and improvements which transfer, control, convey, detain, retain, treat or otherwise influence the movement of stormwater runoff. 
                  Stormwater user fee charge means the periodic user fee charge imposed pursuant to this article by the Cornelia Stormwater Utility for providing stormwater management services. This term shall exclude special charges to the owners of particular properties for services, systems or facilities related to stormwater management, including, but not limited to, charges for development plan review, inspection of development projects, onsite stormwater control systems and other stormwater management services provided by Cornelia for which a corresponding fee is collected for the service rendered. 
                  Undeveloped land means land in its unaltered natural condition or which is modified to such a minimal degree as to have a hydrologic response comparable to land in an unaltered natural condition shall be deemed undeveloped. Undeveloped land shall have minimal impervious surface, which impedes the infiltration of stormwater runoff or causes stormwater runoff to collect, concentrate or flow in a manner materially different from what would occur if the land were in an unaltered natural condition. For purposes of this article, undeveloped land includes property altered from its natural condition by the creation or installation of 500 square feet or less of impervious surface. 
                  User is defined as any person who uses property, which maintains connection to, discharges to, or otherwise receives services from the city for stormwater management.

                  Sec. 40-519.1. - Stormwater user fee billing rates. 
                  (a)  The stormwater utility shall impose a stormwater user fee charge on all developed properties within the service area in accordance with the provisions of this division. The stormwater utility shall apportion the cost of delivering stormwater services to all developed properties based on the demand the property places on the city's stormwater management program, the stormwater services provided by the city and the benefits derived by the property as a result of the provision of services. 
                  (b)  The mayor and city commission shall establish by resolution the stormwater user fee rate, and the commencement date of billing. The billing rates may be modified by the mayor and city commission from time to time to meet the financial and operational needs of the Cornelia Stormwater Utility. A current schedule of said rates shall be on file in the office of the City Clerk of Cornelia. In setting or modifying such rates, it shall be the goal of the city to establish rates that are fair, equitable and reasonable, and which, together with other funding sources available to the Cornelia stormwater utility for services, systems, and/or facilities related to stormwater management are sufficient to support the cost of the stormwater management program, including, but not limited to, the payment of principal and interest on debt obligations, lease payments, operating expenses, capital outlays, non-operating expenses, provisions for prudent reserves and other stormwater utility related costs as deemed appropriate by the city. 
                  (c)  Stormwater user fee charges shall be based upon the total number of equivalent residential units (ERUs) associated with developed properties within the city. Each ERU shall correspond to 3,300 square feet of impervious surface. 
                  (d)  Gravel and compacted soil driveways, parking areas, and roads on private property will be considered partial impervious surface and included in the customer's ERU calculation because of the hydrologic response characteristics of these materials. However, the total surface area associated with these materials will be calculated at 90 percent of the total ERUs to reflect the hydrologic response characteristics of these materials. 
                  (e)  The periodic stormwater user fee charges imposed on all developed properties shall be calculated by multiplying the stormwater user fee billing rate (per ERU) times the number of ERUs for each customer account. The number of ERUs that will be utilized to calculate the user fee charge for each customer account shall be in general accordance with the following: 
                  (1)  SFR Customer Class: Each SFR customer account shall be charged 1.0 ERU per month unless the conditions outlined below applies. 
                  a.  If two customer accounts are assigned to a SFR property (i.e. a duplex) then each customer account on that parcel will be charged 0.5 ERU per month for billing purposes. 
                  (2)  NSFR Customer Class: Each NSFR customer shall be charged 1.0 ERU for each 3,300 square feet, or increment thereof, of impervious surface located on the property to establish the total number of ERUs for billing. Fractional ERUs will be rounded to one decimal place to establish the number of ERUs for billing each month. 
                  (3)  Undeveloped Land Customer Class: Undeveloped land shall be assigned 0 ERUs and will not receive a stormwater user fee bill.

                  Except as provided in this section or otherwise provided by law, no public or private property located in the incorporated area of Cornelia shall be exempt from the stormwater user fee charges. No exception, credit, offset, or other reduction in stormwater user fee charges shall be granted based on age, tax status, economic status, race, religion or other condition unrelated to the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and facilities. Exemptions to the stormwater user fee charges are as follows: 
                  (1)  Parcels which contain less than 500 square feet of impervious surfaces shall be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. 
                  (2)  Railroad rights-of-way (tracks) shall be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. However, railroad stations, maintenance buildings, and/or other improved property used for railroad purposes shall not be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. 
                  (3)  Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) streets and rights-of-way shall be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. This exemption is in recognition of routine drainage system maintenance and capital construction services undertaken by GDOT in association with GDOT rights-of-way and road systems. However, maintenance buildings and/or other improved property used for GDOT purposes shall not be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. All other state, federal, and county properties are subject to the user fee charges on the same basis as private properties. 
                  (4)  Habersham County (county) streets and rights-of-way shall be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. This exemption is in recognition of routine drainage system maintenance and capital construction services undertaken by the county. However, other improved property used for county purposes shall not be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. 
                  (5)  In consideration for the city allowing the stormwater utility to use the city's existing street, curbs, gutters, drainage ways and ditches, storm sewers, culverts, inlets, catch basins, pipes, head walls and other structures, natural and man-made within and owned by the city which controls and diverts surface water for the purposes of collecting, diverting, transporting and controlling surface and stormwaters; the utility shall not charge the city a stormwater user fee charge for the city's impervious surface area resulting from the city's impervious surfaces which are owned and/or maintained by the city within the public rights-of-way.

Copies of the credit technical manual will be maintained by and made available from the city manager. 
                  (1)  A stormwater user fee charge credit shall be determined based on the technical requirements, standards and criteria contained in the credit technical manual. The amount of credit, or reduction of the stormwater user fee charge, shall be in accordance with the criteria contained in the credit technical manual. 
                  (2)  Any credit allowed against the stormwater user fee charge is conditioned on continuing compliance with the city's design and performance standards as stated in the credit technical manual and/or upon continuing provision of the controls, systems, facilities, services, and activities provided, operated, and maintained by the property owner or owners upon which the credit is based. The city manager may revoke a credit at any time for noncompliance with applicable standards and criteria as established in the credit technical manual or this article.

                  Sec. 40-522. - Enforcement methods and inspections. 
                  (a)  All property owners of improved property within the incorporated areas of Cornelia shall provide, manage, maintain, and operate on-site stormwater management systems sufficient to collect, convey, detain, and discharge stormwater runoff in a safe manner consistent with all applicable city development regulations, ordinances, and state and federal laws. Any failure to meet this obligation shall constitute a violation of this article and be subject to citation and prosecution in the Cornelia Municipal Court. Each day such violation exists shall constitute a separate offense, subject to the penalties set forth in section 1-7 of the Code of the City of Cornelia. 
                  (b)  Alternately, in the event a public nuisance is deemed to exist by the city manager, the city may elect to sue in the Superior Court of Habersham County to abate such nuisance. In the event a public nuisance is found by the court to exist, which the property owner fails to abate within such reasonable time as allowed by the superior court, the city may enter upon the property and cause work as is reasonably necessary to be performed, with the actual cost thereof assessed against the property owner in the same manner as a tax levied against the property. From date of filing of such abatement action, the city shall have lien rights which may be perfected, after judgment, by filing a notice of lien on the general execution docket of the Superior Court of Habersham County. 
                  (c)  The city shall have the right for its designated officers and employees to enter upon public and private property during reasonable hours, and after reasonable notice to the owner thereof, in order to assure compliance with the provisions of this article, and state and federal law. Such inspections shall generally be limited to the following purposes: 
                  (1)  Inspecting or conducting engineering analyses on existing stormwater management systems and facilities located on-site; or 
                  (2)  Determining that stormwater management systems and facilities need to be constructed.

                  Sec. 40-523. - Stormwater user fee charge billing, delinquencies, collections, adjustments. 
                  Failure to receive a stormwater utility bill is not justification for non-payment. The property owner, as identified from public land records of Habersham County, shall be obligated to pay the appropriate stormwater user fee charge for that property. 
                  (1)  Billing. 
                  a.  A bill for stormwater user fee charges may be sent through the United States Postal Service or by alternative means, notifying the owner of the property being billed of the amount of the stormwater user fee charge, less credits, the date the payment is due and the date when payment is past due. 
                  b.  The stormwater user fee charge will be billed and collected as deemed most effective and efficient by ordinance of the city commission. 
                  c.  Frequency of the billing of stormwater user fee charges shall be specified by ordinance of the city commission. 
                  d.  Failure to receive a bill shall not be justification for nonpayment. Regardless of the party to whom the bill is initially directed, the owner of each developed property subject to stormwater user fee charges shall be obligated to pay stormwater user fee charges and any interest on delinquent stormwater user fee charge payments. 
                  e.  If a property is unbilled, or if no bill is sent for a particular tract of improved property, the Cornelia Stormwater Utility may back bill for a period of up to one year, but shall not be entitled to any interest or any delinquency charges during the back billed period. 
                  (2)  Delinquencies and collection. 
                  a.  Unpaid stormwater service fees shall be collected by filing suit to collect on an unpaid account and by using all methods allowed by Georgia law to collect on any judgment obtained thereby, including enforcement of any lien resulting from any such judgment. Unless reduced to a judgment and a writ of fieri facias issued, the unpaid user fee charge shall not constitute a direct lien against the property. 
                  b.  A late charge of ten percent of the amount due per year shall be assessed against the party responsible for the unpaid balance of any stormwater utility user fee charge that becomes delinquent in accordance with applicable state law. In addition, the city shall assess all costs of collection, including attorney's fees and court costs, against the party responsible for payment of the stormwater user fee charge. 
                  (3)  Adjustments. The city manager shall administer the procedures and standards for the adjustment of the stormwater user fee charge. 
                  a.  If a customer believes their stormwater user fee is incorrect, the customer may seek an adjustment of the stormwater user fee charge allocated to a property at any time by submitting the request in writing to the city manager and setting forth in detail the grounds upon which relief is sought. 
                  b.  Customers requesting the adjustment shall be required, at their own expense, to provide supplemental information to the city manager, including, but not limited to, a survey certified by a registered land surveyor or a professional engineer. Submittal of this information will be required if the city staff cannot make a determination based on field inspection and/or review of existing city aerial photography. Failure to provide the required information within the time limits established by the city manager, as may be reasonably extended, may result in denial of the adjustment request. 
                  c.  Once a completed adjustment request and all required information are received by the city manager, he or she shall have 30 calendar days within which to render a written decision. If the city manager fails to render a decision within 30 days, the adjustment request shall automatically be deemed denied, but said denial shall be subject to appeal to the city commission as set forth in this article. Concurrent payment of any charges allocated to the property is not required as a condition precedent to this request for review. 
                  d.  In considering an adjustment request, the city manager shall consider whether the calculation of the stormwater utility user fee charge for the property is correct. 
                  e.  The city manager's decision shall be in writing and will be mailed to the address provided on the adjustment request, and service shall be complete upon mailing. 
                  f.  If the result of an adjustment is that a refund is due the applicant, the refund will be applied as a credit on the applicant's next stormwater bill.

                  Sec. 40-524. - Appeals, hearings. 
                  (a)  Appeals. An appeal to the city commission may be taken by any property owner or customer aggrieved by any decision of the city manager. The appeal shall be taken within 30 days of the decision of the city manager by filing with the secretary to the commission a notice of appeal in writing specifying the grounds thereof. Upon the filing of the notice of appeal, the city manager shall forthwith transmit to the city commission all documentation constituting the record upon which the decision appealed from was taken. 
                  (b)  Hearing. The city commission shall fix a reasonable time for hearing the appeal and give written notice to the appellant at least ten days prior to the hearing date. The notice shall indicate the place, date and time of the hearing. The city commission shall affirm, reverse, affirm in part, or reverse in part the decision of the city manager after hearing the evidence. If the decision of the city manager is reversed in whole or in part, resulting in a refund or credit due to the property owner, then such refund or credit shall be calculated retroactive to the date of the initial appeal. 
                  (c)  [Decision]. The decision of the city commission shall be final, and there shall be no further administrative action. Any person aggrieved or dissatisfied with the decision of the city commission may appeal that decision to the Superior Court of Habersham County by writ of certiorari.
