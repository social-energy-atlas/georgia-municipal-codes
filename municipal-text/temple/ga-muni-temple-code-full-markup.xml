PREFACE 
</p>
        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE This Code constitutes a codification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Temple, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances of the City of Temple, Georgia, as provided by the city. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Indexes 
The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Michael E. Raabe, Code Attorney, and Colleen Dalton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida.

If, in his discretion, such employee determines that identity theft or attempted identity theft is likely or probable, such employee shall immediately report such red flags to the city administrator. If, in his discretion, such employee deems that identity theft is unlikely or that reliable information is available to reconcile red flags, the employee shall convey this information to the city administrator. If the city administrator, in his discretion, determines that further action is necessary, a city employee shall perform one or more of the following responses, as determined to be appropriate by the city administrator:

                  (4)	Notify a debt collector within two business days of the discovery of likely or probable identity theft relating to a customer account that has been sold to such debt collector in the event that a customer's account has been sold to a debt collector prior to the discovery of the likelihood or probability of identity theft relating to such account; 
                  (5)	Notify law enforcement, in the event that someone other than the customer has accessed the customer's account causing additional charges to accrue or accessing personal identifying information; or 
                  (6)	Take other appropriate action to prevent or mitigate identity theft.

                  (Ord. of 8-4-2008, § 2-6-2) 
                  Sec. 2-224. - Penalties. 
                  Any public official who knowingly violates any provision of the code of ethics provided in this article shall be subject to public reprimand or censure. If, in the opinion of the ethics committee, the matter warrants such action, the matter may be sent to the solicitor pro hac vice for review for trial in city court, or to another law enforcement agency for investigation. A decision of the committee recommending public reprimand, censure or referral to a law enforcement agency may be appealed to the superior court. Superior court review shall be limited to an inquiry of whether or not there was any evidence before the administrative committee, which supported their decision. If a conviction results in city court, such offense shall be punishable as a misdemeanor, and may result in a $100.00 fine, 60 days in jail, or both. 
                  (Ord. of 8-4-2008, § 2-6-11) 
                  Sec. 2-225. - Intent. 
                  (a)	Declaration of policy. The proper operation of democratic government requires that the mayor and council, city committees, boards, panels, public officials and city employees be independent, impartial and responsible to the people; that government decisions and policy be made in the proper channels of the governmental structure; that public office not be used for personal gain; and that the public have confidence in the integrity of its government. In recognition of these goals, there is established a code of ethics for all officials and employees, whether elected or appointed, paid or unpaid. The purpose of this code is to establish ethical standards of conduct for all officials and employees by setting forth those acts or actions that are incompatible with the best interests of the city and by directing disclosure by such officials and employees of private financial or other interests in matters affecting the city. The provisions and purpose of this code of ethics and such rules and regulations as may be established are declared to be in the best interests of the city. This code of ethics shall apply to all officials, employees and members of boards and commissions, task forces, panels, and authorities of the city. 
                  (b)	Responsibilities of public office. Public officials and employees are agents of public purpose and hold office for the benefit of the public. They are bound to uphold the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the state and to carry out impartially the laws of the nation, state and municipality, and thus to foster respect for all government. They are bound to observe in their official acts the highest standards of morality and to discharge faithfully the duties of their office, regardless of personal considerations, recognizing that the public interest must be their primary concern. 
                  (c)	Procurement of qualified leaders. It is also essential to the proper operation of government that those best qualified be encouraged to serve the government. Accordingly, legal safeguards against conflicts of interest must be so designed as not unnecessarily or unreasonably to impede the recruitment and retention by the city of those men and women who are best qualified to serve. An essential principle underlying the staffing of our government structure is that its elected officials and employees should not be denied the opportunity, available to all other citizens, to acquire and retain private economic and other interests, except where conflicts with the responsibility of such elected officials and employees to the public cannot be avoided. 
                  (d)	Dedicated service. 
                  (1)	All officials and employees of the municipality should be loyal to the objectives expressed by the electorate and the programs developed to attain those objectives. Appointed officials and employees should adhere to the rules of work and performance established as the standard for their positions by the appropriate authority. 
                  (2)	Officials and employees should not exceed their authority or breach the law or ask others to do so, and they should work in full cooperation with other public officials and employees unless prohibited from so doing by law or by the officially recognized confidential nature of their work. 
                  (e)	Distribution of code. The city administrator is authorized and directed to have such number of the code of ethics printed as in his discretion will be sufficient for distribution to the officials, employees and board, panel, task forces, authorities, and commission members, as well as having copies available at the city hall for citizens of the city.

                  Sec. 2-226. - Standards of conduct.

                  (3)	Directly or indirectly request, exact, receive, or agree to receive a gift, loan, favor, promise, or thing of value for himself or another person if it could reasonably be considered to influence the member in the discharge of official duties; 
                  (4)	Disclose or otherwise use confidential information acquired by virtue of his official position for his or another person's private gain; 
                  (5)	Engage in, accept employment with, or render services for any private business or professional activity when such employment or rendering of services is adverse to and incompatible with the proper discharge of official duties; 
                  (6)	Engage in any activity or transaction that is prohibited by law now existing or hereafter enacted which is applicable to him by virtue of being a city official;

                  b.	Perform any work outside the employee's normal course of municipal employment;
                  c.	Purchase goods or services to be used for personal, business, or political purposes; and

                  (9)	Use his position in any way to coerce, or give the appearance of coercing, another person to provide any financial benefit to himself or persons having an interest; or 
                  (10)	Enter into any contract involving services or property with any city official or with a business in which a city official has an interest. This section shall not apply in the case of: 
                  a.	The designation of a bank or trust company as a depository for city funds;
                  b.	The borrowing of funds from any bank or lending institution, which offers the lowest available rate of interest in the community for such loan; 
                  c.	Contracts entered into in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 16-10-6;
                  d.	Contracts entered into under circumstances that constitute an emergency situation provided that the mayor prepares a written record explaining the emergency; 
                  e.	Contracts or business activities entered into with a city official, or with a business in which business city official has an interest, provided that such contract or activity is the result of a competitive bid, disclosure of the nature of such official's interest is made prior to the time any bid is submitted, and a waiver of the prohibition contemplated by this section is issued by the city administrator following disclosure and reporting to the mayor and council; and 
                  f.	Business activities solely between city officials completely unrelated to city affairs or city business. 
                  (b)	The city shall not enter into any contract with any person or business represented by such person, who has been within the preceding 12-month period a city official, unless the contract is awarded by a competitive bid or a committee selection process; 
                  (c)	Subsection (a)(3) of this section shall not apply in the case of:

                  (2)	An award publicly presented in recognition of public service;
                  (3)	A commercially reasonable loan or other financial transaction made in the ordinary course of business by an institution or individual authorized by the laws of the state to engage in the making of such a loan or financial transaction; and

                  (Ord. of 8-4-2008, § 2-6-3) 
                  Sec. 2-227. - Disclosure. 
                  A city official who has an interest or a substantial interest that he has reason to believe may be affected by his official acts or actions or by the official acts or actions of city officials shall disclose the precise nature of such interest or substantial interest by written or verbal statement made in a public meeting no more than 30 days, but at least prior to the matter being heard by a body who will be taking official action on a matter affecting such interest and the city official will abstain from discussion and voting regarding the matter. An elected city official shall disclose the nature of any interest or substantial interest he has at the time such matter is presented to mayor and council or other considering body for discussion. Such written or verbal statements shall be recorded into the minutes of the meeting, and thus become part of the public record. Following any disclosure made pursuant to this section, the city official shall refrain from all ex parte communications with other members regarding the application in which he has an interest or substantial interest.

                  (f)	Employees shall not utilize any city equipment or vehicles in support of any political campaign.

A rejection shall prevent refiling of a complaint regarding the same subject and alleged perpetrator for the same offense within six months of the original complaint filing. 
                  (e)	The ethics committee shall be empowered to conduct probable cause investigations, to take evidence and hold hearings where provided for in this article.

                  (a)	The ethics committee, in any case, shall cause the complaint to be served on the public official charged as soon as practicable. Service may be personal service or certified mail, return receipt requested. Within 60 days of the receipt of a complaint, a hearing shall be held to take appropriate action under section 2-232, as to dismissal, or under this section, as to a full hearing, as needed.

                  (b)	The ethics committee shall conduct the hearing in accordance with the procedures and regulations it establishes, but in all circumstances, the hearing shall include the following: 
                  (1)	Generally, the hearing shall be conducted following the same procedures of court hearings in the state. 
                  (2)	The chairperson of the ethics committee shall conduct the hearing.
                  (3)	The person who filed the complaint shall present his case to the committee first.
                  (4)	Each witness presented by the complaint, and including the complainant, shall be subject to cross examination by the individual accused of the ethical violation or such person's representative. 
                  (5)	At the conclusion of the complainant's case, the respondent shall be entitled to move for dismissal based on insufficient evidence on the part of the complaint. If the respondent makes such a motion and the committee, by majority vote, agrees to dismiss the complaint, the hearing shall be terminated. If either the respondent fails to make such a motion, or, if the committee decides by majority vote to overrule the respondent's motion, the hearing shall continue. 
                  (6)	The respondent shall then be entitled to present his evidence to the committee, if he so chooses. 
                  (7)	The respondent shall then be entitled to testify. The absence of respondent's testimony shall not be viewed by the committee as an admission of any sort. 
                  (8)	If the respondent testifies, then the respondent shall be subject to cross examination by the complainant. All other witnesses who testify in the respondent's case shall be subject to cross examination by the complainant. 
                  (9)	All persons who testify before the committee shall be placed under oath, by either the chairperson or a person designated by the chairperson or the city attorney. The oath shall read as follows: 
                  "Do you solemnly swear or affirm that the testimony you are about to give in this matter shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?" 
                  (10)	At the conclusion of the respondent's case, the complainant may offer rebuttal evidence only to those items presented in the respondent's case. At the conclusion of the complainant's rebuttal, the respondent shall be entitled to offer rebuttal evidence only to those matters presented in the complainant's rebuttal case. 
                  (11)	At the conclusion of all the testimony and closure of all the evidence, the committee members may ask questions of any of the individuals who testified before the committee. 
                  (12)	At the conclusion of all questions by committee members, the chairperson shall end the hearing and permit the committee to deliberate in public. If the committee decides by majority vote that additional evidence is needed to make a decision, the committee shall have the authority to conduct its own investigation or to require either the complainant or respondent, subject to the respondents right against self incrimination unless the same is waived by respondent, to submit additional evidence at a continuation of the hearing which must be held no later than 45 days after the date of the initial hearing. The committee has no authority to continue the hearing past the 45-day deadline. The committee cannot require the respondent to testify if he has not already done so, and the respondent cannot be forced to incriminate himself unless he has already testified, presented evidence, or in some matter waived his right against self-incrimination. 
                  (13)	The receipt of additional evidence shall follow the same format outlined in subsections (1) through (12) of this subsection. Following the conclusion of any additional evidence received at the continued hearing, the committee shall continue deliberation then the chairperson shall call for a vote. The committee's first vote must be whether or not the respondent violated the ethics code as charged by the complainant. If, by majority vote, the committee rules that the respondent did not violate the ethics code as charged by the complainant, then the matter is concluded. If the committee, by majority vote, concludes that the respondent did violate the ethics code as charged by the complainant, then the committee must make a second decision by majority vote as to the appropriate penalty. 
                  (14)	At any hearing held by the ethics committee, the public official who is the subject of inquiry shall have the right to written notice of the complaint at least ten business days before a hearing, to be represented by counsel, to hear and examine the evidence and witnesses, and to present evidence and witnesses in opposition or in extenuation and to be provided copies of any document in possession of the city or complainant to be used against him at least five business days in advance of the hearing. Failure to provide such documents shall preclude their submission and consideration by the committee. 
                  (15)	The complainant's evidence must prove that the respondent is guilty of the offense charged by the evidentiary standard commonly referred to as "a preponderance of the evidence." 
                  (16)	If any question concerning the hearing procedures which is not otherwise addressed in this article arises, the city attorney, or in his absence the appointed legal advisor to the committee, shall resolve the procedural question by advisory opinion, then such opinion shall be adopted or declined by the committee.

                  Sec. 4-42. - Types of entertainment, attire and conduct prohibited. 
                  (a)	Preamble and purpose. 
                  (1)	Based upon the experiences of other counties and municipalities, including, but not limited to, Atlanta and Fulton County, Georgia; DeKalb County, Georgia; Austin, Texas; Seattle and Renton, Washington; New York, New York; Los Angeles, California; and Ft. Lauderdale and Palm Beach, Florida, which experiences the city council believers are relevant to the problems faced by the city and based upon the evidence and testimony of the citizens and experts who have appeared before such bodies, as well as the testimony of an expert received by this council, the city council takes notes of the notorious and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities with our country. 
                  (2)	Moreover, it is the finding of the city council that public nudity and semi-nudity, under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances relating to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in so-called "nude bars" or establishments offering so-called "nude entertainment" or "erotic entertainment," begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with nudity and alcohol are disorderly conduct, position, and drug trafficking and use. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with nudity and alcohol are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhoods, increase expenditure for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increase burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior herein described, and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas. Therefore, the prohibition of nude or semi-nude conduct in establishments licensed to sell distilled spirits, malt beverage or wine for consumption on the premises is in the public welfare and is a matter of governmental interest and concern to prevent the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments that serve alcohol and also allow and/or encourage nudity or semi-nudity. 
                  (b)	Prohibited activities. Any establishment licensed under the provisions of this chapter is prohibited from permitting or engaging in the following activities: 
                  (1)	The employment or use of any person in any capacity in the sale or service of distilled spirits, malt beverages or wine while such person is unclothed or in such attire, costume or clothing as to expose to view any portion of the female breast below the top of the areola or any portion of the pubic hair, anus, cleft of the buttocks, vulva or genitals; 
                  (2)	Live entertainment that provides or features nude or semi-nude or erotic dancing or the performance of obscene acts that simulate: 
                  a.	Sexual intercourse, masturbation, sodomy, bestiality, oral copulation, flagellation or any sexual acts that are prohibited by law; 
                  b.	The touching, caressing or fondling of the breast, buttock, anus or genitals; or
                  c.	The displaying of the pubic hair, anus, vulva or genitals.
                  (3)	The showing of any film still pictures, electronic reproduction or other visual reproductions depicting any of the acts described in subsection (2) above, which are obscene under state law; or 
                  (4)	The holding, promotion or allowance of any contest, promotion, special night or any other activity where patrons of the licensed establishment are encouraged or allowed to engage in any of the above-prohibited conduct.

                  (b)	Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
                  (1)	Best management practices as set forth in subsection (b) of this section and section 16-101(c) shall be required for all land disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with subsection (b)(2) of this section or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the state Water Quality Control Act. As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
                  (2)	A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the state Water Quality Control Act, for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This subsection shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale, unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  (3)	Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the state Water Quality Control Act, for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)	The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to this chapter for the purpose of governing land disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit, and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  a.	Stripping of vegetation, regarding and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  b.	Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum;
                  c.	Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practical erosion potential; 
                  d.	Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented;
                  e.	The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  f.	Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable;
                  g.	Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  h.	Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  i.	To the extent necessary, sediment in runoff must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this subsection, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
                  j.	Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  k.	Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property;
                  l.	Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  m.	Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible; provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  n.	Land disturbing activity plans for erosion and sedimentation control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection (b)(2) of this section; 
                  o.	Except as provided in subsection (b)(4)p of this section, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, or where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented; provided, however, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-20 et seq., the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this subsection. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  1.	No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; 
                  2.	The buffer shall not apply to the following land disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
                  (i)	Stream crossings for water lines; or
                  (ii)	Stream crossings for sewer lines;
                  p.	There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-20 et seq., the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams, which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less, shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  1.	No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  2.	The buffer shall not apply to the following land disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream, and cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer, and provided adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented:

                  Sec. 16-101. - Application and plan requirements; permit process. 
                  (a)	General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall review the general development plans and detailed plans of the local issuing authority that affect the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall review the zoning, stormwater management, subdivision, and flood damage prevention regulations, this article, and ordinances which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the operator is the only party who may obtain a permit. 
                  (b)	Application requirements. 
                  (1)	No person shall conduct any land disturbing activity within the jurisdictional city boundaries without first obtaining a permit from the city to perform such activity. 
                  (2)	The application for a permit shall be submitted to the city and must include the applicant's erosion and sedimentation control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Such plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection (c) of this section. Soil erosion and sedimentation control plans shall conform to the provisions of section 16-100(b)(4)o and p. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by six copies of the applicant's soil erosion and sedimentation control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan, or that such a visit was not required in accordance with the rules and regulations established by the board. 
                  (3)	A land disturbance fee in the amount of $100.00 plus $25.00 for each acre or fraction thereof in the project area shall be paid to the city prior to land disturbance for clearing and grubbing activities. 
                  (4)	A land disturbance fee in the amount of $100.00 plus $25.00 for each acre or fraction thereof in the project area (commercial/industrial land use), or $100.00 plus $25.00 for each lot (residential land use) in the project area (for commercial/industrial land use), shall be paid to the city prior to land disturbance for grading and construction activities. 
                  (5)	In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a), one-half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the jurisdiction, except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  (6)	Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion and sedimentation control plan. A district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of a district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district and any variances required by section 16-100(b)(4)o and p and bonding, if required per subsection (b)(8) of this section, have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. 
                  (7)	If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this Code section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing of the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
                  (8)	The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof, up to but not exceeding $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this article or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for a hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  (c)	Plan requirements. 
                  (1)	Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in section 16-100(b) and this subsection, as well as any additional requirements set forth by the city (e.g., 50-foot undisturbed vegetation requirement in the stream buffer article) and NRCS.

                  Sec. 16-102. - Inspection and enforcement. 
                  (a)	The city will periodically inspect the sites of land disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate both primary and secondary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land disturbing activities as defined in section 16-97 has failed to comply with the approved plan, permit conditions, or provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article. 
                  (b)	The city shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this article, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land disturbing activities. 
                  (c)	No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, commission, district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
                  (d)	The districts or the commission or both shall periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). The districts or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion and sedimentation control program. The districts or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
                  (e)	The board shall promulgate rules and regulations setting forth the requirements and standards for certification and the procedures for decertification of a local issuing authority. The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinances and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have 30 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within 30 days after notification by the division, the division may revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority.

               <p>                  ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

                  Sec. 18-1. - Definitions. 
                  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Base flood means the flood having a one percent chance of being equalled or exceeded in any given year. 
                  Development means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations. 
                  Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
                  (1)	The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and
                  (2)	The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source.
                  Flood hazard boundary map (FHBM) means the official map issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency where the areas of special flood hazard have been designated as Zone A. 
                  Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means the official map of a community, on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
                  Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. 
                  Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement. An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for the parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable nonelevation design requirements. 
                  Mobile homes means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. It does not include recreational vehicles or travel trailers. 
                  Start of construction (for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act, Pub. L-97-348) excludes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of a structure, other than a mobile home, on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings or any work beyond the stage of excavation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, bootings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not as part of the main structure. For a structure, other than a mobile home, without a basement or poured footings, the actual start includes the first permanent framing or assembly of the structure or any part thereof on its piling or foundation. For mobile homes not within a mobile home park or mobile home subdivision, the actual start means the affixing of the mobile home to its permanent site. For mobile homes within a mobile home park or mobile home subdivision, the actual start is the date on which the construction of facilities for servicing the site on which the mobile home is to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the construction of streets, either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads, and installation of facilities) is completed. 
                  Substantial improvement means any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a structure the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure either before the improvement or repair is charted or, if the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred. 
                  (1)	For the purposes of this definition, substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. 
                  (2)	The term does not, however, include either:
                  a.	Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to ensure safe living conditions; or 
                  b.	Any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a state inventory of historic places.

                  Sec. 18-2. - Penalties for violation. 
                  Violation of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any of its requirements, including violation of conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants of variance or special exceptions, shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined and/or imprisoned as provided in section 1-13, and in addition shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Each day such violation continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the city from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.

                  Sec. 18-3. - Purpose. 
                  It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)	Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities; 
                  (2)	Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (3)	Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters;

                  Sec. 28-36. - Tax districts created; cost of providing and maintaining service. 
                  (a)	There are created special tax districts, which shall be known as streetlight tax districts, which shall be identified by a number assigned by the city public works department. Each such streetlight tax district identified by a streetlight tax district number shall contain and include the tax parcel number of each lot within such streetlight tax district. Existing streetlight districts shall become streetlight tax districts upon the enactment of the legislation from which this section is derived, and new streetlight tax districts shall be created upon an application or proper petition and approval of the mayor and council as provided hereinafter. Each new streetlight tax district so created shall be assigned a number and shall contain the tax parcel numbers of each lot contained therein. 
                  (b)	A register of streetlight tax districts shall be maintained in the city engineering/public works office. Such registers shall be available to the public for inspection upon reasonable notice to either of these offices. 
                  (c)	The cost of providing and maintaining streetlight service as provided by this article shall be borne by the property owners receiving the service. The charge therefor shall be such as is determined by resolution of the mayor and council, giving consideration for the streetlights, electrical service charges, and size and number of the lots serviced by the streetlights. In the event of excessive vandalism to streetlights within a district which results in a city being billed for repairs, the city may prorate these repair bills and add a pro rata share of these bills to the charge. Charges shall be assessed against all lots within the streetlight district whether or not the lot is located within the boundaries of a particular subdivision, so long as the lot is located within the boundaries of the streetlight district. 
                  (Ord. of 11-6-2000, art. I, § 2) 
                  Sec. 28-37. - Tax imposed; collection; administration.

                  (b)	The administration of the services provided in this article and for all billing and accounting shall be the responsibility of the mayor and council or its designee, or some department of the city government to which that responsibility shall be assigned by the mayor and council. 
                  (c)	Whereas the office of the city shall be responsible for the timely collection of the tax assessed to each streetlight tax district, it shall not be responsible for accounting beyond its internal accounting procedures in order to provide an adequate record of the collection and transmittal of the funds.

                  In addition to the other charges authorized in this article, the city shall have the right to require deposits from the lot owners receiving the streetlight service in such amount as shall be determined by the mayor and council. This deposit shall be held by the city as security for payment for services rendered pursuant to this article, and the city shall have the authority to set off against the deposit for nonpayment for services at such times and on such occasions as shall be determined by the city. Notice of such setoff shall be given to the lot owner by mail at the address of the property services by the streetlights, although advance notice of such setoff shall not be required. In the event of a reduction in the deposit of a property owner because of failure to pay charges assessed pursuant to this article, the lot owner shall be required to restore the deposit to its required level upon request by the city.

                  Sec. 28-40. - Service layout for new areas; city approval; developer responsible for costs. 
                  (a)	All developers of residential subdivisions in the city with lots less than five acres in size, and all developers of shopping centers, industrial parks and similar such developments, shall be required at their own expense to provide streetlight services in the public rights-of-way in such developments in conformity with this article. 
                  (b)	Such developers, at the time of the submission of the preliminary plats or drawings of the development, or at the time of application for a building permit, whichever shall first occur, shall present a proposed streetlight layout which details the proposed streetlight service for the development. The proposal presented by the developer must be approved by the city engineer or other similar official prior to obtaining any building permit for that development. All fixtures and standards/poles installed or to be used shall be approved not only by the city, but also by the utility company which will provide electricity to the streetlights and which will be responsible for the maintenance of the facilities. All such fixtures shall meet the Illumination Engineering Society (IES) standards. Should the city engineer disapprove the streetlight layout, the grounds for disapproval shall be communicated in writing to the developer. Any such disapproval by the city engineer may be appealed to the mayor and council by filing a request for review with the county engineer within 30 days from the date of the written notice of disapproval. The city engineer shall, at that point, transmit to the mayor and council all papers and related documents pertaining to the action taken by the county engineer, and the mayor and council shall review the matter at the next regularly scheduled public meeting. The mayor and council may reverse or affirm, entirely or in part, the decision of the city engineer. 
                  (c)	At the time of the submission of the final plat for the subdivisions, shopping centers, industrial parks, office parks or other such development on which streetlights have been constructed at the expense of the developer, the developer shall pay to the city in advance a sum equal to the customary streetlight rates charged by the city for similar developments for a period of one year. 
                  (d)	The county engineer shall not receive the final plat until such time as all the provisions of this section have been satisfied, and until the developers further submit to the city engineer proof of payment for construction and installation of the streetlights in the areas sought to be dedicated, together with a copy of an executed agreement with the appropriate utility company for complete maintenance of all streetlights and related structures, wires and installations. 
                  (e)	Upon the recommendation of the subdivision review staff, the mayor and council shall approve or deny the final plat by resolution at a regularly scheduled mayor and council meeting not later than 45 days following the submission of the recommendation of the review staff. The streetlight district is created upon the approval of the final plat by the mayor and council. The date of creation for the streetlight district shall be the date of approval of the final plat. 
                  (f)	Notwithstanding all other provisions of the subdivision laws, city rules and regulations of planning and zoning and other ordinances, any developer, contractor or other persons securing approval in accordance with subsections (a) through (e) of this section shall post a bond equal to the installation cost and one year's electrical power for the streetlighting. This bond must be given at the time of written approval of the design as specified in subsection (b) of this section. The bond shall be payable to the chairperson or the mayor and council and will provide that it shall remain in full force and effect until such time as the city or its designated representative shall have indicated that the work required for the construction and installation of streetlighting in a subdivision has been satisfactorily completed.

                  (a)	Any lot owner in any unincorporated area of the city may present a request for the creation of a streetlight district to the city engineer. Upon receipt of the request, the city engineer shall determine the appropriate boundaries for a streetlight district which will serve the lot owner presenting the request and neighboring lot owners. The city engineer shall then prepare a plat showing the proposed streetlight district, and a petition for the creation of the proposed streetlight district shall then be circulated among the lot owners in the proposed district. If 75 percent of the lot owners in the proposed district sign the petition for the creation of a streetlight district, the petition shall be presented to the mayor and council. The mayor and council shall conduct a public hearing for the purpose of determining whether or not to create the proposed streetlight district, giving consideration to safety and economic factors in making such determination. Unless 100 percent of the lot owners have signed the petition, the public hearing shall be advertised one time in the official county organ, and signs shall be posted in the proposed streetlight district giving notice of the hearing, at least ten days before the public hearing. The number and size of the signs shall be such as is required by the county zoning regulations for a request to rezone property.

                  (4)	In exercising the powers described in subsections (1) through (3) of this section, the board of zoning appeals may, in conformity with the provisions of these regulations, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirements, decision or determination, and to that end shall have all the powers of the city official from whom the appeal is taken and may issue or direct the issuance of a variance.

                  DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

                  Sec. 36-19. - Consumer's responsibility and liability. 
                  (a)	Consumption. Water provided by the city shall be used for consumption by the consumer, members of his household and employees only. The consumer shall not sell water to any other person or permit any other person to use such water. Water shall not be used for irrigation, fire protection, or other purposes, except when water in the area is of sufficient quantity without interfering with the regular domestic consumption in the area served. Disregard for this rule shall be sufficient cause for refusal and/or discontinuation of service. 
                  (1)	Water meters. 
                  a.	Residential. Residential water meters will be installed on the city's side of the right-of-way in a place approved by the water department. 
                  b.	Commercial. Commercial water meters will be installed by a licensed contractor working for the developer of the new commercial property. The meter and backflow or double check valve assembly to be installed on a commercial property will be provided by the city. 
                  (2)	New and existing service. 
                  a.	New service. On all new consumer services, the city will furnish and maintain one shutoff valve or curbstop, one water meter, one backflow prevention device and one meter box with lid in order to protect the water meter from damage. The consumer agrees to furnish an approved pressure reduction valve, or PRV, in accordance with the latest building codes. 
                  b.	Existing service. For existing water meters that do not currently have a backflow prevention device, the city will install a backflow prevention device when the meter is replaced during routine or necessary replacement. 
                  (3)	Piping, apparatus and maintenance. The consumer's piping and apparatus shall be installed and maintained by the consumer at the consumer's expense, in a safe and efficient manner, and in accordance with state health department sanitary regulations and applicable state plumbing codes. The city assumes no responsibility for any damages that may occur, either natural or any other causes, on any piping or apparatuses on the consumer's side of the water connection. The water connection is where the city's liability ends (i.e., where the customer connects to the city's furnished backflow prevention device.) 
                  (4)	Service lines. 
                  a.	Private wells. The use of private wells within the city limits is permitted for both consumption and irrigation provided that the service lines from a private well do not connect with the same water supply system that a city service connection connects to. 
                  b.	City water supply system. Connection of both a private well and a city water service line to a residential water system may cause possible contamination to the city's water supply due to a cross connection. This is in accordance with both state health guidelines and state plumbing codes. 
                  (5)	Usage fee. Residences that are using private wells for water consumption must pay a usage fee when a city water main and/or service line is accessible to the property. 
                  (b)	Prior regulations. Effective January 7, 2008, the guidelines listed in subsection (a) of this section supersede any arrangements made by prior city administrations.

                  (4)	Theft of water from fire hydrants. Only approved city hydrant meters may be used to receive water from fire hydrants within the city limits. The city only maintains a limited number of hydrant meters at any given time. If one is not available, the city may make considerations on allowing a non-city-issued hydrant meter provided that an application and deposit have been submitted to city hall and the hydrant meter has been inspected and read by a city water technician. Anyone caught taking water from a city fire hydrant or blowoff will be subject to a theft by taking charge, a fine as shown in subsections (4)a, b and c of this section, possible arrest, and the person will be responsible for paying the city for the amount of water taken at its current rate per gallon. The following shall apply: 
                  a.	First offense: $500.00 fine and subject to possible arrest.
                  b.	Second offense: $750.00 fine and subject to possible arrest.
                  c.	Third offense: $1,000.00 fine, subject to possible arrest, and revocation of any applicable work permits. 
                  (5)	Theft of water from unmetered sources (e.g., new subdivision unmetered water services). Only approved city water meters are to be used on the distribution system. A consumer or builder must contact city hall regarding completing a water service application and must put down the applicable deposit. If a meter is not installed at the address where water service is requested, the city will install a meter and backflow prevention device under the following guidelines: 
                  a.	In new developments where a shutoff valve and meter box have been provided by a developer, the city will install a meter and backflow prevention device within five business days from the date of application and deposit. This is contingent upon the water technician having unimpeded access to the meter box and shutoff valve. If the box is not accessible, the developer/builder is responsible for correcting any damage or inaccessible meter boxes. 
                  b.	In cases where a new service line must be tapped into an existing main, the city will have a minimum of five business days and a maximum of ten business days to install the service line, meter and backflow device. This time will begin from the day the water service application and deposit have been submitted to city hall.

                  Sec. 36-135. - Purpose and intent. 
                  (a)	Purpose. The purpose of this article is to protect the public health, safety, environment and general welfare through the regulation of nonstormwater discharges to the separate storm sewer system to the maximum extent practicable as required by federal law. This article establishes methods for controlling the introduction of pollutants into the separate storm sewer system in order to comply with the requirements of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit process. 
                  (b)	Objectives. The objectives of this article are to: 
                  (1)	Regulate the contribution of pollutants to the separate storm sewer system by any person; 
                  (2)	Prohibit illicit discharges and illegal connections to the separate storm sewer system;
                  (3)	Prevent nonstormwater discharges, generated as a result of spills, inappropriate dumping or disposal, to separate storm sewer system; and 
                  (4)	Establish legal authority to carry out all inspection, surveillance, monitoring and enforcement procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this article.

                  Sec. 36-136. - Finding of fact. 
                  The city has determined that: 
                  (1)	Discharges to the city separate storm sewer system that are not composed entirely of stormwater runoff contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters. 
                  (2)	These nonstormwater discharges occur due to spills, dumping and improper connections to the city separate storm sewer system from residential, industrial, commercial or institutional establishments. 
                  (3)	These nonstormwater discharges not only impact waterways individually, but geographically dispersed, small volume nonstormwater discharges can have cumulative impacts on receiving waters. 
                  (4)	The impacts of these discharges adversely affect public health and safety, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters. 
                  (5)	These impacts can be minimized through the regulation of spills, dumping and discharges into the city separate storm sewer system.

                  Sec. 36-137. - Regulations; adoption of article provisions. 
                  (a)	Local governments in the state are required to comply with a number of state and federal laws, regulations and permits which require a local government to address the impacts of stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution due to improper nonstormwater discharges to the city's separate storm sewer system; 
                  (b)	Therefore, the city adopted the provisions in this article to prohibit such nonstormwater discharges to the separate storm sewer system. It is determined that the regulation of spills, improper dumping and discharges to the separate storm sewer system is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety, and the environment.

                  Sec. 36-151. - Dilution. 
                  No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The designated city representative may impose mass limitations on users who are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.

                  Sec. 36-152. - Conventional pollutants. 
                  The conventional pollutants, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), total suspended solids (TSS), and oil and grease are controlled in order to prevent overloading of the treatment plant's ability to supply oxygen, digest and remove oil and grease. Ordinance limits of 100 mg/l for oil and grease have evolved from years of experience in actual operations, and are limits that have empirically been found to be effective in protecting the treatment works. 
                  Industrial discharge limits for BOD and TSS are derived from the total plant design capabilities with an allowance for dilution from normal domestic wastewater. The plant was designed to handle average influent BOD and TSS loadings of 230 mg/l. Average domestic components of wastewater typically include 220 mg/l BOD and TSS. Industrial users are estimated to contribute approximately 30 percent of the total flow and are allowed to discharge up to 250 mg/l BOD and TSS without surcharge. A surcharge is applied to user charges for wastewater strengths in excess of 250 mg/l BOD or TSS to discourage industries from discharge high strength wastes. The surcharge is a very effective mechanism for achieving voluntary compliance, and the industries in the city rarely pay surcharges. A prohibition Limit of 500 mg/l for BOD5 and TSS is in place to guard against a single industry discharging extremely high strength waste and potentially disrupting the treatment process. Fines and other sanctions are applied if prohibition limits are exceeded. Surcharges limits are exceeded. Surcharges limits are derived as follows: 
                  Ind. BOD (Ind. Flow) + Dom. BOD (Domestic Flow) = Total BOD (Total Flow) 
                  Allowable Industrial BOD = Total BOD (Total Flow) - Dom BOD (Dom Flow) 
                    Ind. Flow 
                  Use: Allowable BOD and TSS concentrations = 250 mg/l 
                  The city wastewater treatment facilities have been designed to handle an average influent ammonia nitrogen (NH3 N) concentration of 38 mg/l. Since land applicable is used for disposal of the entire plant effluent, ammonia nitrogen is not controlled by the plant-operating permit. Actual experience has shown that the existing ordinance surcharge limit of 20 mg/l and prohibition limit of 50 mg/l for ammonia nitrogen have been effective in protecting plant operations against upset.

                  Sec. 36-256. - Inspections and authority to enforce regulations. 
                  (a)	Authority to inspect. The compliance inspectors shall inspect food service establishments on both an unscheduled and unannounced basis or on a scheduled basis. All food service establishments may be inspected four or more times per year. Inspection of a FOG interceptor shall be performed at frequencies necessary to protect the capacity of the sewer system against the accumulation of FOG in an amount that would exceed the 40 percent rule. Inspection shall include all fixtures, equipment, food processing, and storage areas, and shall include a review of the processes that produce wastewater discharged from a facility through the FOG interceptor. Any deficiencies shall be noted, including but not to be limited to: 
                  (1)	Failure to report changes in operations or wastewater constituents and characteristics;
                  (2)	Failure to properly maintain the FOG interceptor;
                  (3)	Failure to maintain logs, files, records, or access for inspection or monitoring activities;
                  (4)	Failure to obtain or renew the FOG discharge permits in a timely manner; or
                  (5)	Any other violations of these regulations or state law that requires correction by the food service establishment. 
                  (b)	Right of entry. Where it is necessary to make an inspection to enforce the provisions of these regulations or where the compliance inspector or designee has reasonable cause to believe that there exists in a building or structure or upon a premises, a condition which is contrary to or in violation of the applicable provisions of this Code, the compliance inspector or designee is authorized to enter the building, structure or premises at reasonable times to inspect or perform any of the duties imposed by the applicable provisions of this Code. If such building, structure, or premises is occupied, the inspector shall present credentials to the occupant and shall request entry. If such building, structure, or premises is unoccupied, the inspector shall first make a reasonable effort to locate the owner or other person having charge or control of the building, structure, or premises and request entry. If entry is refused, the inspector shall have recourse to the remedies provided by law for entry. In the event of an emergency involving actual or imminent sanitary sewer overflow, the inspector may access adjoining businesses or properties that share a sewer system with a food service establishment in order to prevent or remediate an actual or imminent sewer overflow.

Noncompliance fees shall be in the amount adopted by action of the governing authority. 
                  (b)	Non-compliance letters. Immediately following every inspection and/or FOG evaluation, the food service establishment inspected shall receive a letter indicating the results of the inspection. A certified letter of noncompliance means the food service establishment is in violation of the applicable provisions of this Code. Letters of non-compliance shall include a description of the code being violated and the immediate course of action the food service establishment shall be required to take to come into compliance. Failure to comply with a letter of non-compliance is also a violation of these regulations.

Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR parts 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such is known and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the waste stream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste stream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days after discharge commences. Any notification under this paragraph need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under section 36-335. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of sections 36-331, 36-333 and 36-334 
                  (b)	Discharges are exempt from the requirements of subsection (a), during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge having more than 15 kilograms non-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
                  (c)	In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the designated city representative, the EPA Regional Waste Management, waste division director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations. 
                  (d)	In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
                  (e)	The provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this article, a permit issued there under, or any applicable federal or state law.

                  Sec. 36-395. - Upset. 
                  (a)	For the purpose of this section, upset, means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
                  (b)	An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection (c), are met. 
                  (c)	A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
                  (1)	An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset;
                  (2)	The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 
                  (3)	The user has submitted the following information to the designated city representative within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days): 
                  a.	A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance;
                  b.	The period of noncompliance, including dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
                  c.	Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
                  d.	In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall the burden of proof. 
                  e.	Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
                  f.	Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.

                  Sec. 36-396. - Bypass. 
                  (a)	For the purpose of this section:
                  (1)	Bypass means the international diversion of waste streams from any portion of the user's treatment facility. 
                  (2)	Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
                  (b)	A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsections (c) and (d). 
                  (1)	If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the designated city representative, at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
                  (2)	A user shall submit oral notice to the designated city representative of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The designated city representative may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours. 
                  (1)	Bypass is prohibited, and the designated city representative may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless 
                  a.	Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
                  b.	There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods downtime or preventive maintenance, and 
                  c.	The user submitted notices as required under subsection (c).
                  (2)	The designated city representative may approve a bypass, after considering its adverse effects, or if the designated city representative determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (d)(1).

                  Sec. 36-406. - [Generally.] 
                  In addition to normal rates, charges and fees, surcharges shall be levied for wastewater with strengths in excess of the permitted limits. These limits are: chemical oxygen demand (COD) 500 (mg/l) and/or total suspended solids (TSS) of 250 (mg/l) based on flow composites. This surcharge reflects the increased operation and maintenance costs and other increased expenses incurred in the treatment of wastewater with strengths in excess of permitted limits. 
                  The surcharge is calculated as follows: 
                  _____ 
                  (1)	COD surcharge: 
                   (Actual COD - Allowed COD) 
                  COD Factor = ——————————————- × 65* 
                  (Allowed) 
                  COD Surcharge = (COD Factor) × (Sewer Rate) × (Units Used) 
                  (2)	TSS surcharge: 
                   (Actual TSS Allowed TSS) 
                  TSS Factor = —————————————- × 35** 
                  (Allowed TSS) 
                  TSS Surcharge=(TSS Factor) × (Sewer Rate) × (Units Used) 
                  *65 percent of the treatment effort goes to COD/BOD removal 
                  **35 percent of the treatment effort goes to TSS removal

                  (a)	Purpose and intent. 
                  (1)	Treatment of nonconformity. This section sets out the provisions that protect uses. Structures and lots that lawfully existed prior to the adoption of this zoning ordinance or a subsequent amendment, but no longer conform to the new regulations.

                  (2)	Nonconforming development declared incompatible. Lawful nonconforming uses, structures and lots are declared by this zoning ordinance to be incompatible with land uses, structures, lots and signs that conform to the requirements of the zoning districts in which the nonconformity exists.

                  (b)	Nonconforming uses. 
                  (1)	Defined.

                  (2)	Grandfathered. 
                  a.	To avoid undue hardship, the lawful but nonconforming use of any structure or land at the time of the enactment of this zoning ordinance or any subsequent amendment may be continued even though the use does not conform to the provisions of this zoning ordinance, except that the nonconforming use: 
                  1.	Shall not be changed to another nonconforming use.
                  2.	Shall not be reestablished after its removal from the property or its discontinuance for six consecutive months or more. 
                  3.	Shall not be enlarged or altered in a way that increases its nonconformity.
                  4.	Shall not be replaced after removal.
                  b.	If an existing use was lawfully established in a zoning district that is subsequently amended to require special use approval for such use, the existing use shall not be subject to the provisions of this subsection. 
                  c.	The strengthening or restoration to a safe condition of any structure or part thereof declared to be unsafe by an official charged with protecting the public safety or health shall be allowed upon order of such official.

A nonconforming structure is a structure or building whose size, dimensions or location on a property were lawful prior to the adoption, revision or amendment of this zoning ordinance, but which, by reason of such adoption, revision or amendment no longer meets or conforms to one or more such requirements of this zoning ordinance. 
                  (2)	Grandfathered. A nonconforming structure may continue to be occupied and used, except that the nonconforming structure: 
                  a.	Shall not be repaired, rebuilt or altered after damage if the cost or repairing exceeds 50 percent of its replacement cost at the time of destruction unless the structure is a single-family residence. 
                  b.	Shall not be enlarged or altered in a way that increases its nonconformity.
                  (3)	Exception. If the public acquisition of a portion of a lot reduces any yard dimension to less than that required by this zoning ordinance, the structure shall not be considered nonconforming. 
                  (d)	Nonconforming lots. 
                  (1)	Defined. A nonconforming lot is a lot of record whose area, frontage, width or other dimensions were lawful prior to the adoption, revision or amendment of this zoning ordinance, and which, by reason of such adoption, revision or amendment, no longer meets or exceeds one or more such requirements of the applicable zoning district.

                  (3)	Combination; where required. If the owner of two or more adjoining lots with continuous frontage, at least one of which is a nonconforming lot, decides to build on one or more of such lots, he must first combine said lots to comply with the dimensional requirements of this zoning ordinance. 
                  (4)	Exception. If the public acquisition of a lot reduces the lot area, frontage, width or other dimension to less than that required by this zoning ordinance, such lot shall not be considered nonconforming. 
                  (5)	Previously approved nonresidential lots. Lots in subdivisions for property zoned nonresidential and other than DCD, for which a final plat has been approved prior to January 1, 2004, shall be developed in accordance with the dimensional standards of the zoning ordinance and other applicable development ordinances effective on December 31, 2003, provided that all necessary permits and development approvals are secured prior to July 6, 2001, and that development activity or building construction continues without interruption (except because of war or natural disaster) until the development or construction is complete; however, such property shall be developed in accordance with the procedure and approval requirements of ordinances effective at the time of development.

                  Sec. 38-46. - Flood hazard boundary map. 
                  The official zoning map is supplemented by an official flood hazard boundary map for the incorporated area of the city. The flood hazard boundary map as hereby adopted consists of a map depicting the 100-year floodplains and identified as the Flood Insurance Rate Map of the Corps of Engineers, Temple, Georgia, as set forth on file and available for inspection in the office of the city clerk, and data extracted from U.S. Army Corps of Engineers reports. 
                  (1)	Purpose. The flood hazard boundary map is intended to give the general location of flood hazard areas. Hydrological studies, engineering computations, flood records, and field surveys compiled and certified by a registered professional engineer may be required. 
                  (2)	Correction and amendment of map. As additional engineering and hydrological data including U.S. Army Corps of Engineers reports become available for specific properties or for entire streams which demonstrate to the satisfaction of the department of engineering that a more exact delineation of the flood hazard boundary lines may be established, the city engineer shall propose such corrections to amend the official flood hazard boundary map for adoption be the mayor and council.

                  (a)	The boundaries of the districts as shown on the official zoning map shall be determined on the basis of the legal descriptions associated with approved zoning petitions or, lacking such legal descriptions, on the basis of the location of the boundary as depicted on the official zoning map along with any dimensions shown. 
                  (b)	Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of districts as shown on the official zoning map, the following rules shall apply: 
                  (1)	Unless otherwise indicated, the district boundary lines are construed to follow the centerlines of streets or highways, property lines, a line lying in the center of a stream or drainageway, or the city limits. 
                  (2)	Where a district boundary line parallels a street, highway or railroad right-of-way but no dimension is given, the distance shall be scaled from the official zoning map. 
                  (3)	Where a district boundary line divides a lot that is of single ownership at the time of the effective date of this zoning ordinance, the zoning classification of the least restricted portion may be interpreted to extend into the remainder of the lot, except that such extension shall not include any part of a lot that lies more than 35 feet beyond the district boundary line. 
                  (4)	In the event the exact location of a boundary cannot be determined by the methods described in subsections (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this section, the city council shall, upon application, determine the location of the boundary.

                  Sec. 38-72. - Purposes. 
                  (a)	R-1, Single-family detached residential district. The R-1 zone is established to protect and promote the emphasizes on suburban-urban development rather than rural activities; however, it is recognized that agriculture and the raising of poultry and livestock may still be an activity in this district, and provision is, therefor, made for limited forms of such activity with appropriate safeguard for nearby residences. 
                  (b)	R-2, Single-family detached residential district. The R-2 zone is established to protect and promote a suitable environment for family life, to discourage any use which would generate other than normal residential area traffic on minor streets, and to protect the orderly future development of land in accordance with the land use plan for the city, at a density of not more than two units per acre. 
                  (c)	R-4, Single-family detached residential district. The R-4 zone is established to protect and promote a suitable environment for family life, to discourage any use which would generate other than residential traffic on minor streets, to met the needs and demands of single-family residences and to protect the orderly future development of land, all in accordance with the land use plan for the city, at a density of not more than four units per acre. A minimum development site size of five acres. All R-4 subdivisions are required to have a minimum of 20 percent greenspace, to be maintained by the homeowners association. 
                  (d)	R-6, Single-family detached and attached, townhouse and multifamily residential district. The R-6 zone is established to protect and promote a suitable environment for family life and to encourage flexibility in meeting the needs of families, by permitting townhouse and multifamily dwellings in accordance with the land use plan for the city at a density of no more than six units per acre and development sites of at least one-half acres. 
                  (e)	DCD, Design concept development district. The purpose of a design concept development is to encourage the best possible site plans and building arrangements under a unified plan of development, rather than under lot-by-lot regulation. The developer benefits from better land utilization, economy in the provision of roads and utilities and flexibility in design. Approval of an overall concept plan by the city council provides an opportunity to ensure that the development will be in accordance with the land use plan and the character of the neighborhood in which the development is located. The design concept development district is intended to encourage ingenuity and resourcefulness in land planning, to ensure the provision of park and recreation land and facilities for the use of the occupants of the development in order to obtain a more desirable environment, and to encourage a mix of land use for creation of communities where individuals can live, work and play. A design concept development district is required to include at least two types of land use (unless waived by planning and zoning commission, mayor, and city council) that are not otherwise allowed together in another zoning district, or at least two types of residential density, in order to promote unique solutions to land development issues. A design concept development district is intended to be a relatively large-scale project on a site of 50 acres or more. DCD developments are required to have a minimum of 20 percent greenspace with developed amenities, maintained by the homeowners association. 
                  (f)	O-I, Office-institutional district. The O-I office-institutional district is established to provide a district for offices, institutions, and limited commercial activities not involving the sale, storage, or processing of merchandise unless otherwise permitted herein, along with appropriate accessory uses, in accordance with the land use plan for the city. 
                  (g)	CN, Neighborhood commercial district. The CN neighborhood commercial district is intended to provide suitable areas for the retailing of goods and services to surrounding residential neighborhoods and at the same time protect the residential neighborhoods from intrusive traffic and parking congestion in accordance with the land use plan for the city. 
                  (h)	CBD, Central business district. The CBD central business district is intended to protect and promote a suitable area for office, institutional, and commercial uses, which benefit from proximity to each other, to encourage the eventual elimination of uses inappropriate to a central business area, and to encourage the intensive development of a central business district for the city, in accordance with the land use plan for the city. Residential uses are appropriate in the central business district when combined with nonresidential uses in mixed-use buildings, as long as the nonresidential uses occupy at least 50 percent of the gross floor area. 
                  (i)	CSC, Shopping center district. The CSC shopping center district is a district for planned shopping centers designed to accommodate general retail and personal service activities conducted in a unified development and designed to serve a wide area. 
                  (j)	CG, General commercial district. The CG general commercial district is intended to provide areas for those business and commercial uses that are a higher intensity than neighborhood commercial districts or for the central business district, in accordance with the land use plan for the city. 
                  (k)	IL, Light industrial district. The IL light industrial district is established to protect and promote a suitable environment for light industrial purposes, including accessibility to major transportation facilities, availability of adequate utilities and other public services, and availability of large quantities of suitable land. Uses compatible with light industrial development are to be encouraged insofar as they are in accordance with the land use plan for the city. 
                  (l)	IH, Heavy industrial district. The IH heavy industrial district is established to protect and promote a suitable environment for heavy industrial purposes, including accessibility to major transportation facilities, availability of adequate utilities and other public services and availability of large quantities of open land. Uses compatible with light and heavy industrial development are to be encouraged insofar as they are in accordance with the land use plan for the city. 
                  (m)	FH, Flood hazard overlay district. The flood hazard overlay district is comprised of lands that are subject to periodic flooding. The intent of the regulations within this zoning district is to limit the use of such floodplain lands to prevent flood damage to persons and properties and minimize expenditures for flood relief programs, flood control projects and flood damage repair; preserve drainage courses that will be adequate to carry storm water runoff from existing and future land developments; prohibit landfills or other obstructions to the flow of floodwaters; permit uses that are appropriate on floodplains and utilize effectively this valuable resource. 
                  (n)	Environmental overlay districts. Environmental districts are established for the following purposes: 
                  (1)	To promote health, safety and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to erosion, siltation and water pollution; 
                  (2)	To create vegetation buffer areas adjacent to rivers, creeks and streams; and
                  (3)	To protect wetlands and groundwater recharge areas.

                  Sec. 38-119. - Special provisions. 
                  In furtherance of the purposes for which the DCD district is established, the following shall apply: 
                  (1)	Character of land use. A DCD must contain at least two types of land use (unless waived by the planning and zoning commission, mayor, and city council) that are not otherwise allowed together in another zoning district or two types of residential density. 
                  (2)	Concept plan required, development standards. 
                  a.	Development of the DCD shall be guided by a graphic concept plan that designates the land uses of the DCD. The concept plan may be accompanied by a development standards text, which may be approved as a condition of zoning or special use, providing development standards and uses for the project which vary, augment or limit the requirements of this zoning ordinance and the development code. 
                  b.	To the extent that the approved concept plan and development standards for a DCD contradict the development code and the zoning ordinance, the contradictory provisions of the development code and the zoning ordinance are inapplicable to that DCD. 
                  (3)	Concept plan as a condition of zoning. No changes in land use or density shall be allowed in any approved and incorporated concept plan or development standards text, except as subsequently approved pursuant to a rezoning of the property. For properties zoned to DCD concurrent with the adoption of the Official Zoning Map on January 1, 2004, and for which development has commenced but is not complete on January 1, 2004, the individual land use plan for any such property shall serve as a concept plan, and such property shall continue to be developed in accordance with development standards applicable at the time of adoption of the land approved for such property by the mayor and council. For all properties zoned to DCD and the development standards applicable to each, by location, shall be established as a condition of approval by the city council at the time that the property is rezoned to DCD. 
                  (4)	Open spaces required. 
                  a.	Within the DCD, 20 percent of the gross land area must be set aside as common open space, half of which must be usable for active or passive recreation. 
                  b.	The open space areas and facilities shall be held in common by a legally constituted association of property owners with the financial capability to maintain the open space. 
                  c.	For the purposes of calculation, common open space does not include any streets or public rights-of-way, or yard areas or landscape areas located on private property. Common open space does include land and water areas that are available to all occupants of the DCD on a continuing and permanent basis, such as walking trails, community centers or clubhouses, golf courses and other recreation areas, protected flood plains or wetlands. Protected floodplains and wetlands shall be protected by a conservation easement. 
                  d.	Lands dedicated to public use, such as school or fire station, shall be credited as part of the 20 percent common open space requirement. 
                  (5)	Compatibility. Land uses developed at the perimeter of the site shall be developed in a manner that is compatible with adjacent off-site land uses or zoning, or a 100-foot-wide buffer shall be provided between the uses in the DCD and the perimeter of the setbacks, and other development standards. 
                  (6)	Maximum area and density for residential uses. 
                  a.	Except as provided in subsection (6)b of this subsection, no concept plan shall be approved for any DCD development of 500 acres or less which exceeds the following limits for residential use: 
                  1.	Maximum acreage area for residential use: 75 percent of total land area.
                  2.	Maximum acreage area for multifamily (attached residential units at R-6 density) residential use: Ten percent of total land area. 
                  3.	Maximum overall residential density (calculated based on property designated for residential base zone): Five units per acre. 
                  4.	Maximum residential density within the multifamily (attached units at R-6 density) land use area: Six units per acre. 
                  b.	Exception: The council may waive the requirements of the subsection upon an express finding of special circumstances where any DCD adjoins property of equal or greater acreage which is developed as commercial, office, industrial or any combination thereof. 
                  c.	No lots shall be less than 7,500 square feet.
                  d.	No more than 25 percent of total lots in the proposed development will be allowed to be under 10,000 square feet. 
                  e.	25 percent of total lots shall be greater than 14,000 square feet with a minimum house size of 1,600 square feet for these lots. 
                  f.	Overall average home size for the development shall be a minimum of 1,400 square feet unless otherwise stipulated and approved by planning and zoning, mayor, and city council.

                  Sec. 38-140. - Purpose. 
                  The purpose of this division is to regulate certain types of businesses including, but not limited to, adult entertainment establishments, to the end that many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses will be curtailed. However, it is recognized that such regulation cannot defacto approach prohibition. Otherwise a protected form of expression would vanish. As to adult dance establishments, this division represents a balancing of competing interests; reduced criminal activity and protection of the neighborhood through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments versus the protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons. 
                  (Ord. No. 0-00-106, § 2, 12-4-2000) 
                  Sec. 38-141. - Findings. 
                  (a)	Based on the experience of other urban counties and municipalities including, but not limited to, Atlanta and Fulton County, Georgia; Dekalb County, Georgia; Richmond County, Georgia; Amarillo, Texas; Austin, Texas; Garden Grove, California; Houston, Texas; Renton, Washington; Phoenix, Arizona; Indianapolis, Indiana; St. Paul, Minnesota; Tucson, Arizona; Augusta, Georgia; LaGrange, Georgia; Dalton and Whitfield County, Georgia; Carrollton, Georgia; Smyrna, Georgia; and Ft. Lauderdale and Palm Beach, Florida, which experiences, we believe are relevant to the problems faced by the city, the city council takes note of the notorious and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within our country. 
                  (b)	Moreover, it is the findings of the council that public nudity, either partial or total, under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages, begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with nudity are disorderly conduct, prostitution, and drug trafficking and use. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with nudity are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhood, increased expenditure for the allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior herein above described, and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas. Therefore, the limitation of nude conduct in establishments is in the public welfare and it is a matter of governmental interest and concern to prevent the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which allow or encourage nudity. Based on these findings, this division is adopted to regulate certain types of businesses and to establish where such activity may or may not be conducted.

                  The purpose of this division is to provide standards and regulations to protect the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of the city. The city recognizes that manufactured housing meets the needs of many city residents for affordable housing and is compatible with site-built housing if developed in accordance with comparable standards. These regulations shall govern the use and operation of all manufactured homes on single lots or within parks used for permanent residential occupancy, as well as recreational vehicle parks used for temporary occupancy, in the incorporated city. It is the intent of these regulations to empower the city planning commission, the county health department, and the building inspections department to review the development of manufactured home sites, manufactured home parks, and recreational vehicle parks within the incorporated areas of the city for the purposes stated in this division.

                  (a)	Authority. The Official State of Georgia Department of Natural Resources Rules for Environmental Planning Criteria (Chapter 391-3-16), established pursuant to O.C.G.A. §§ 12-5-440 through 12-5-457, and other relevant rules and statutes. 
                  (b)	Definitions. These definitions are also contained in article I of this zoning ordinance. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this subdivision, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Aquifer means any stratum or zone of rock beneath the surface of the earth capable of containing or producing water from a well. 
                  Base zone means the primary zoning designation of a property that confers restrictions on buildings and land use. All property in the city has one base zone (such as R-2 single-family residential or CG general commercial), but properties may be further regulated by one or more overlay zoning districts. 
                  Creek. See Stream. 
                  Free-flowing creek, stream, or river. See Regulated stream. 
                  Impervious surface means manmade structures, improvements and surfaces that prevent or significantly limit the infiltration of storm water. Examples of impervious structures and improvements are: buildings, structures, roads, driveways, parking lots, decks, swimming pools, patios, and sidewalks. Examples of impervious materials often used to construct such improvements are: asphalt, concrete, gravel, brick, stone, wood, asphalt shingles, metal, and composite materials. 
                  Overlay zone means a zoning district, which may be placed on property in addition to its base zoning. Property may be regulated by a single or by multiple overlay zones. 
                  Recharge area means any portion of the earth's surface, where water infiltrates into the ground to replenish an aquifer. 
                  Regulated stream. See Stream, regulated. 
                  River means a natural, free-flowing watercourse that is typically of greater volume than a stream or creek. 
                  Significant recharge area means those areas mapped by the state department of natural resources in Hydrologic Atlas 18 (1989 edition). 
                  Stream means a natural, free-flowing watercourse with either constant or intermittent flow of moderate volume typically less than that of a river. 
                  Stream buffer means a strip of natural indigenous vegetation (of width determined by the watershed protection regulations) adjacent and parallel to the bank of a regulated stream designed to preserve and improve the quality of water within the regulated stream and its watershed. 
                  Stream, regulated, means a natural, free-flowing watercourse that meets certain criteria as established within the watershed protection district regulations. Such streams are subject to the requirements of the watershed protection district regulations. 
                  Watershed means the total area of land that is drained by a river or stream and its tributaries. 
                  Wetland means those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas. The ecological parameters for designating wetlands include hydric soils, hydrophytic vegetation, and hydrological conditions that involve a temporary or permanent source of water to cause soil saturation. 
                  Wetlands, jurisdictional, means an area that meets the definitional requirements for wetlands as determined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

                  Sec. 38-397. - Characteristics. 
                  These districts shall overlay the base zoning of properties so that all land within the various environmental overlay districts shall also have a base zoning classification. Each parcel within these overlay districts shall be subject to the regulations of both the base zoning district and the overlay district within which it lies. If there is a conflict or redundancy between the regulations and standards of the base zone and the overlay zone, the more restrictive regulation shall govern.

                  Sec. 38-398. - Districts. 
                  (a)	Groundwater recharge area protection district (GW). The GW district is established to protect the quality of groundwater by regulating land uses within significant groundwater recharge areas. This is necessary to protect the public health, safety, and welfare, particularly those persons and communities who rely on groundwater as their source of potable water supply. The GW district is mapped on the official zoning map corresponding to the areas mapped as significant recharge areas by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources in Hydrologic Atlas 18, 1989 edition. 
                  (1)	No construction may proceed on a building or mobile home to be served by a septic tank unless the county health department first approves the proposed septic tank installations as meeting the requirements of the Georgia Department of Human Resources for On-Site Sewage Management (DHR Manual), and subsections (a)(2) and (3) of this section. 
                  (2)	New homes served by a septic tank/drain field system shall be on lots having at least 110 percent of the subdivision minimum lot size calculated based on application of Table MT-1 in the DHR Manual. The minimums set forth in Table MT-1 may be increased further based on consideration of other factors (set forth in Sections A-F) of the DHR Manual. However, any lot of record approved prior to the adoption of these regulations is exempt from this requirement. 
                  (3)	New mobile home parks shall be served by sanitary sewer.
                  (4)	New agriculture waste impoundment sites shall be lined if they exceed 50 acre-feet. As a minimum, the liner shall be constructed of compacted clay having a thickness of one foot and a vertical hydraulic conductivity of less than five by 10.7 cm/Sec. or other criteria established by the Natural Resource and Conservation Service. 
                  (5)	New aboveground chemical or petroleum storage tanks, having a minimum volume of such tanks or 110 percent of the volume of the largest tank in a cluster of tanks. Such tanks used for agricultural purposes are exempt, provided they comply with all federal requirements. 
                  (6)	New facilities that handle hazardous materials of the types listed in Section 312 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (excluding underground storage tanks) and in amounts of 10,000 pounds or more on any one day shall perform their operations on impervious surfaces and in conformance with any applicable federal spill prevention requirements and local fire code requirements. 
                  (b)	Wetlands protection district (WP). 
                  (1)	The WP district is established to promote the protection of wetlands in the city, which are indispensable, fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion, and soils limitations. Furthermore, they provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife, and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; opportunities for study and education; and space and recreational opportunities. 
                  (2)	Wetlands are commonly lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution, and other acts. Piecemeal and cumulative losses will have the effect of destroying additional wetlands over time. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare. The WP district shall comprise the following two categories: all lands mapped as wetland areas by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory Maps (Generalized Wetlands Map); and all lands that, in the course of development review, are determined by the city to have significant evidence of wetlands. 
                  (3)	The generalized wetlands map is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this zoning ordinance, together with all explanatory matter thereon and attached thereto. The generalized wetlands map cannot serve (and therefore should not be used) as a substitute for a delineation of jurisdictional wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any action by the city under this zoning ordinance does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements. 
                  (4)	No activity which will, or which may reasonably be expected to, result in the discharge of dredged or fill material in waters of the U.S. (excepting those activities exempted in Section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act) will be permitted within the WP district without written permission or a permit from the city. A wetlands delineation by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers shall be required in the following circumstances: 
                  a.	If the area proposed for development is located within 100 feet of an area delineated as wetlands by the generalized wetlands map as determined by city staff. 
                  b.	If an area within a development site is determined by city staff to have significant evidence of wetlands. 
                  (5)	If the corps determines that wetlands are present on a proposed development site, the local permit or permission will not be granted until a Section 404 permit or letter of permission is issued. 
                  (6)	The following uses shall be allowed as of right within the wetlands protection district to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law, including laws of trespass, provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining, or dredging except as provided herein, and provided they have no impact on a navigable waterway that would necessitate acquisition of a Section 404 permit or a permit under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act. 
                  a.	Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish, and other wildlife, provided it does not affect waters of the state or of the United States in such a way that would require an individual Section 404 permit. 
                  b.	Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding, and canoeing. 
                  c.	Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the state forestry commission and as specified in Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. 
                  d.	The cultivation of agricultural crops. Agricultural activities shall be subject to best management practices approved by the state department of agriculture. 
                  e.	The pasturing of livestock, provided that riparian wetlands are protected, that soil profiles are not disturbed and the approved agricultural best management practices are followed. 
                  f.	Education, scientific research, and nature trails.
                  (7)	The following uses are prohibited within the wetlands protection district.
                  a.	Receiving areas for toxic or hazardous waste or other contaminants;
                  b.	Hazardous or sanitary waste landfills;
                  c.	Any other use not specifically exempted as noted above or properly approved by the city and relevant state and federal agencies. 
                  (c)	Watershed protection districts. 
                  (1)	In order to provide that the health, safety, welfare, and quality of life of the public drinking water is ensured, land disturbance and development can increase erosion and sedimentation that decreases the storage capacity of reservoirs. In addition, stormwater runoff, particularly from impervious surfaces, can introduce toxins, nutrients, and sediment into drinking water supplies, making water treatment more complicated and expensive and rendering water resources unusable for recreation. 
                  (2)	The purpose of these districts is to establish measures to protect the quality and quantity of the present and future water supply of the city, as well as the City of Carrollton and jurisdictions downstream from the county; to minimize the transport of pollutants and sediment to the water supply; and to maintain the yield of water supply watersheds. 
                  (3)	These district regulations are designed for compliance with O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8 and the Official Georgia Department of Natural Resources Rules for Environmental Planning, as well as for consistency with goals 2 through 5 of chapter 5 of the 1994 city comprehensive plan. All land within the incorporated area of the city is regulated by one of the watershed protection districts. The districts are established and designated on the official zoning map corresponding to the topographical features that delimit the drainage basins of the respective creeks, rivers and reservoirs. 
                  (4)	General regulations for all watershed protection districts.
                  a.	Required stream buffers, but not regulated streams or wetlands, may be included in the gross land area for purposes of calculation of the percentage of a site's impervious surface area. 
                  b.	All property within watershed protection districts may be developed or re-developed as permitted by its base zoning, provided the development is also in compliance with these watershed protection regulation. 
                  c.	The following uses are exempt from watershed protection district regulations (with some limitations and conditions as noted): 
                  1.	Development and land use legally established prior to the adoption of these regulations.
                  2.	Mining activities permitted by the department of natural resources under the Surface Mining Act (outside of stream buffer areas). 
                  3.	Specific forestry and agricultural activities (outside of stream buffer areas) that are consistent with best management practices established by the state forestry commission/department of agriculture and do not impair the quality of streams. 
                  d.	Criteria for regulated streams. All watercourses that appear as a solid or broken line on either the USGS Quadrangle Maps or the SCS Soil Survey for the county, shall be regulated streams if they possess one or more of the following characteristics, as determined by city staff based on data analysis and/or field review: 
                  1.	Evidence of significant water flow along the channel or bed of the watercourse, characterized by one or more of the following: 
                  i.	Hydraulically sorted sediments;
                  ii.	Scouring or vegetation and vegetative litter; and
                  iii.	Loosely rooted vegetation caused by the action of moving water.
                  2.	Evidence of hydric soils, hydrophytic vegetation, or wetlands in or around the channel or bed of the watercourse. 
                  3.	The watercourse drains an area of 20 acres or greater.
                  e.	Watershed protection regulations table.

                  2 Regulated activities include all impervious surfaces, septic tanks, drain fields, and animal/livestock pasturing, keeping, or grazing. 
                  3 Measured from edge of wetlands where present. 
                  4 See definition of "impervious surface." For most development, impervious surface calculations shall be required on a lot-by-lot basis. However, in master planned communities, the maximum percentage can be met on a project-wide basis provided that the project is planned in detail and adequate controls are established (through deed restrictions, zoning plans and conditions, or other mechanisms) to ensure compliance. 
                  f.	Regulatory requirements for stream buffers. All stream buffer areas shall be maintained with appropriate indigenous plant species for the maintenance of groundcover and limitation of erosion. Undisturbed natural vegetation is reestablishment of indigenous vegetation and ground cover is encouraged. No construction, grading, clearing, grubbing, excavating, filling, or other land disturbing activity shall be permitted within the stream buffer. As an exception to this rule, the following limited uses maybe established within the buffer provided that: land disturbance and impact in the stream buffer is minimized to the greatest extent possible; proper soil erosion and sedimentation control is established and maintained; and the disturbed area is stabilized and appropriately revegetated approved as soon as possible following the completion of approved wok within the buffer. 
                  1.	Sanitary sewer lines may be located along and across stream buffers, if it is determined by WSA that no reasonable design alternative exists. 
                  2.	Other utility lines may cross-stream buffers, when it is determined by the utility provider that no reasonable design alternative exists. 
                  3.	Private driveways and public roads may cross stream buffers as near as possible to 90 degrees when necessary and as approved by the city in the subdivision or development review process. 
                  4.	Recreational amenities (such as trails, wildlife observation stands, and other low impact uses) when approved by the city as an element of a development plan. 
                  5.	Cutting and clearing (with handheld tools) of live trees less than two inches in caliper measure at a point 4½ feet above grade, and dead trees, provided the stumps and root structure of trees are left in place to ensure minimal soil erosion potential. 
                  g.	Regulatory requirements for reservoir buffer.
                  1.	Buffers around public water supply reservoirs shall be maintained as required in the watershed management plans for the respective reservoirs. In no case shall the required buffer be less than 150 feet in width. 
                  2.	Buffers around private reservoirs shall meet the same criteria as for stream buffers in section 38-398(c)(4)f. However, all improved areas within the required buffers of existing private reservoirs (e.g., lawns, docks, patios, etc.) may continue to be maintained, as they exist at the time of the adoption of these regulations.

                  c.	No advertising is permitted on an antenna or tower;
                  d.	No signs or illumination are permitted on an antenna or tower unless required by the FCC, FAA or other state or federal agency of competent jurisdiction in which case the director of planning and zoning may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding uses and views; and 
                  e.	The number and location of antennae, communication towers or other receiving or transmitting devices located on a single structure is not excessive and does not adversely affect adjacent properties and views. 
                  (3)	Prohibitions. No new cell may be established if there is a technically suitable space available on an existing tower within the search area that the new cell is to serve. For the purpose of this section, the search area is defined as the grid for the placement of the antenna. 
                  (c)	General requirements. The requirements set forth in this subsection shall govern the location and construction of all towers, and the installation of all antennae, governed by this section. 
                  (1)	Building codes; safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity of communication towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes and the applicable standards for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries Association, as amended from time to time. Tower owners shall conduct periodic inspections of communication towers at least once every three years to ensure structural integrity. Inspections shall be conducted by structural engineers licensed to practice in the state. The results of such inspection shall be provided to the director of planning and zoning. 
                  (2)	Regulatory compliance. 
                  a.	All towers and antennae must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC and any other agency of the state or federal government with the authority to regulate communications towers and antennae. If such standards and regulations are changed then the owners of the communications towers and antennae governed by this section shall bring such communication towers and antennae into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six months of the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a more stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal agency. 
                  b.	Tower owners shall provide documentation showing that each communication tower is in compliance with all federal requirements. Evidence of compliance must be submitted every 12 months. 
                  (3)	Security. Communication towers shall be enclosed by decay-resistant security fencing not less than six feet (1.83 meters) in height and shall be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device; provided, however, the director of planning and zoning or the governing body may waive such requirements for alternative tower structures. 
                  (4)	Lighting. No illumination is permitted on an antenna or tower unless required by the FCC, FAA or other state or federal agency of competent jurisdiction in which case the director of planning and zoning may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding uses and views. 
                  (5)	Advertising. No advertising is permitted on an antenna or tower. 
                  (6)	Visual impact. 
                  a.	Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA or other applicable federal or state agency, be painted a neutral color, so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness. 
                  b.	At a tower site the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and built environment. 
                  c.	If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to m or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible. 
                  d.	Towers clustered at the same site shall be of similar height and design.
                  e.	Towers shall be the minimum height necessary to provide parity with existing similar tower supported antenna, and shall be freestanding where the negative visual effect is less than would be created by use of a guyed tower. 
                  (7)	Landscaping. Landscaping shall be used to effectively screen the view of the tower compound from adjacent public ways, public property and residential property and shall be as follows: 
                  a.	For towers 150 feet (45.72 meters) tall or less, a buffer area no less than six feet (1.83 meters) wide shall commence at the property line. 
                  b.	For towers more than 150 feet (45.72 meters) tall, a buffer area not less than ten feet (3.05 meters) wide shall be provided at the property line. 
                  c.	The buffer zone is to consist of materials of a variety, which can be expected to grow to form a continuous hedge at least five feet (1.52 meters) in height within two years of planting. 
                  d.	Trees and shrubs in the vicinity of guy wires shall be of a kind that would not exceed 20 feet (6.10 meters) in height or would not affect the stability of the guys, should they be uprooted, and shall not obscure visibility of the anchor from the transmission building or security facilities and staff maintenance. 
                  e.	Native vegetation on the site shall be preserved to the greatest practical extent. The applicant shall provide a site plan showing existing significant vegetation to be removed, and vegetation to be replanted to replace that lost. 
                  f.	In lieu of these standards, the director of planning and zoning may allow use of an alternate detailed plan and specifications for landscape and screening, including plantings, fences, walls and other features designed to screen and buffer towers and accessory uses. The plan shall accomplish the same degree of screening achieved by the provisions above, except as lesser requirements are desirable for adequate visibility for security purposes and/or for continued operation of existing bona fide agricultural or forest uses such as farms, nurseries and tree farms. In certain locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, such as remote agricultural or rural locations or developed heavy industrial areas, the landscaping requirement may be reduced or waived by the planning and zoning director. 
                  (8)	Maintenance impacts. Equipment at a transmission facility shall be automated to the greatest extent possible to reduce traffic and congestion. Where the site abuts or has access to a collector and local street, access for maintenance vehicles shall be exclusively by means of the collector street. 
                  (9)	Principal, accessory and joint uses. 
                  a.	Accessory structures used in direct support of a tower shall be allowed but not be used for offices, vehicle storage or other outdoor storage. Mobile or immobile equipment not used in direct support of a tower facility shall not be stored or parked on the site of the tower, unless repairs to the tower are being made. 
                  b.	Towers may be located on sites containing another principal use in the same build able area as long as all of the other sighting, setback, separation and general requirements of this section are met. The minimum distance between a tower and another principal use located on the same lot for a monopole or lattice tower shall be the greater of 20 percent of the tower height or 25 feet (7.62 meters), and for a guy tower shall be equal to the height of the tower. This separation is required to ensure compatibility of land uses and to provide for the health, safety and welfare of individuals and structures occupying the same site. 
                  c.	Joint use of a site is prohibited when a proposed of existing principal use includes the storage, distribution or sale of volatile, flammable, explosive or hazardous materials such as propane, gasoline, natural gas and dangerous chemicals. 
                  (10)	Tower lot size, setbacks and separations. 
                  a.	Towers may occupy a parcel as a principal use meeting the minimum lot size requirements for the zoning district in which it is located. 
                  b.	The site shall be of a size and shape sufficient to provide an adequate setback from the base of the tower to any property line abutting a residential district, public property, or public street. Such setback shall be sufficient to comply with all of the following: 
                  1.	Provide for an adequate vegetative, topographic or other buffer as required in this subsection; 
                  2.	Provide a setback of 50 feet (15.24 meters) between any safe-fall tower and all property lines other than those abutting residential property or property containing any existing or planned place of property containing any existing or planned place of public assembly, or any public or private street; 
                  3.	Provide a setback of 50 feet (15.42 meters) plus the height of the tower between any safe-fall or non-safe-fall tower and all property lines abutting residential property or property containing any existing or planned place of public assembly, or any public or private street; and 
                  4.	Meet the minimum yard and setback requirements of the zoning district in which the tower is located. 
                  c.	Placement of more than one tower on a lot shall be permitted, provided all setback, design and landscape requirements are met as to each tower. Structures may be located as close to each other as technically feasible, provided tower failure characteristics of the towers on the site will not lead to multiple failures in the event that one fails. 
                  d.	All structures and uses associated with the transmission use other than the transmission tower shall be located to meet the setbacks required in the zoning district where the tower is to be located. To encourage and accommodate shared requirements by up to 50 percent to accommodate the placement of additional buildings or other supporting equipment at a tower site. 
                  e.	No freestanding communication tower shall be allowed within a 1,000-foot (304.80 meters) radius of an existing tower within a residential area. 
                  f.	In no case shall a tower be located in the required front yard of a residential district.
                  _____ 
                  g.	All freestanding towers constructed after December 31, 2003, shall conform to the following minimum tower separation requirements:

                  2.	Minimum tower separation requirements (metric). 

                   
                  _____
                  (d)	Shared use. All new towers shall be designed to structurally accommodate the maximum number of additional users technically practicable. 
                  (1)	Once a new tower is approved, additional antennae and accompanying accessory uses may be added to it in accordance with the approved share plan if the director of planning and zoning finds that the standards of this section are met. 
                  (2)	If a new tower is approved, the owner shall be required as conditions of approval, to: 
                  a.	Record the letter of intent required for an application for a building permit under Appendix B: Development Code in the deed records of the clerk of superior court;

                  d.	Allow shared use where the third party seeking such use agrees in writing to pay reasonable, pro rata charges for sharing, including all charges necessary to modify the tower and transmitters to accommodate shared use, but not total tower reconstruction, and to observe whatever technical requirements are necessary to allow shared use without creating interference. 
                  (3)	Willful, knowing failure of an owner, whose tower was approved after the effective date of this section, to comply with the requirements of subsections (d)(2)a through d of this section shall be grounds for withholding approval of any application by such owner for a building permit or special use permit for any tower or antenna. 
                  (4)	Such conditions shall run with the land and be binding on subsequent purchasers of the tower site. 
                  (e)	Removal of antennae and towers. All towers and antennae shall be maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable building and technical codes so as to ensure the structural integrity of such towers. If upon inspection by the building official such tower is determined not to comply with the code standards or to constitute a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to the owner of the tower and the owner of the property if such owner is different, such owners shall have 30 days to bring such tower into compliance. In the event such tower or antenna is not brought into compliance within 30 days, the city may provide notice to the owners requiring the tower or antenna to be removed. The city may pursue all legal remedies available to it to ensure that communication towers and antenna not in compliance with the code standards or which constitute a danger to persons or property are brought into compliance or removed. The city may seek to have the tower or antenna removed regardless of the owners' or operator's intent to operate the tower or antenna and regardless of any permits, federal, state or otherwise, which may have been granted. 
                  (f)	Abandoned towers. 
                  (1)	Any antenna or tower that is not operated for a continuous period of 12 months shall be considered abandoned, whether or not the owner or operator intends to make use of the tower. The owner of an abandoned antenna or tower and the owner of the property where the tower is located shall be under a duty to remove such a tower or antenna. The city may pursue all legal remedies available to it to ensure that an abandoned communication tower or antenna is removed regardless of the owner's or operator's intent to operate the tower or antenna and regardless of any permits, federal, state or otherwise, which may have been granted. 
                  (2)	If the owner of an abandoned tower or antenna wishes to use such abandoned tower or antenna, the owner first must apply for and receive all applicable permits and meet all of the conditions of this section as if such tower or antenna was a new tower or antenna. 
                  (g)	Preexisting towers/nonconforming uses. 
                  (1)	All communications towers properly permitted and operative on June 2, 1997, shall be allowed to continue their present usage as a nonconforming use and shall be treated as a nonconforming use in accordance with this zoning ordinance. Routine maintenance, including replacement with a new tower of like construction and height, shall be permitted on such existing towers. New construction other than routine maintenance on an existing communication tower shall comply with the requirements of this section. 
                  (2)	A communication tower that has received city approval in the form of either a building permit or special use exception, but has not yet been constructed or placed in operation shall be considered an existing tower so long as such approval is current and not expired. 
                  (h)	Public property. Antenna or towers located on property owned, leased or otherwise controlled by the city shall be exempt from the requirements of this section, provided a license or lease authorizing such antenna or tower has been approved by the city council.

                  In order to determine compliance with the maximum allowable sign areas permitted under this division, the area of a sign shall be considered the area of the sign structure unless otherwise stated. The area of a sign structure (for freestanding signs) and the area of a sign face (for building signs) shall be computed as follows: 
                  (1)	Area of sign structure (for freestanding signs). 
                  a.	The area of a sign structure shall be computed as the area within the smallest rectangle enclosing the limits of the surface of a sign whereon the sign face or sign face modules may be placed, including all portions of a sign structure that provide a background for the sign face but are not intended to contain any message or idea and are purely structural or decorative in nature. 
                  b.	Any open space contained within the limits of the rectangle delimiting the sign face, sign face module, or sign structure shall be included in the computation of the area of such sign face, sign face module, or sign structure. 
                  c.	For multifaced signs, when the sign face surfaces are parallel, or back-to-back, or where the interior angle formed by the faces is 45 degrees or less, the area of the sign shall be the total area on all sides that can be viewed at one time from any angle. 
                  (2)	Area of sign face (for building signs). 
                  a.	The area of a sign face shall be computed as the area within the smallest rectangle enclosing the limits of a sign face, or the combination of the areas of all such rectangles delimiting each sign face module, together with any frame or material, texture, or coloring forming an integral part of the sign face or used to differentiate the sign face from the structure upon which it is placed. 
                  b.	The computation of the area of a sign face shall not include the structure, supports or uprights on which the sign face is placed or any portions of a sign structure that are not intended to contain any message or idea and are purely structural or decorative in nature, other than those portions contained within the rectangle that delimits the sign face or a sign face module. 
                  c.	For any sign on which the words, letters, figures, symbols, logos, fixtures, colors, or other design elements routinely change or are intended to be changed from time to time, the sign face area shall include the entire area within which any words, letters, figures, symbols, logos, fixtures, colors, or other design elements may be placed, together with any frame or material, texture, or color forming an integral part of the sign face or used to differentiate the sign face from the structure upon which it is placed.

                  (7)	Will the height, size or location of the buildings or other structures on the property are compatible with the height, size or location of buildings or other structures on neighboring properties?

                  (9)	In taking action on an appeal or variance request, the board of adjustments and appeals or city council may: 
                  a.	Approve, approve with changes, or deny the request;

                  c.	Allow withdrawal of the appeal or variance at the request of the applicant.

If a request specifically for a variance is denied by the city council, another request for a variance affecting the same property shall not be considered by the city council for a period of six months from the date of denial; provided, however, that the city council may reduce the waiting period under extenuating circumstances or on its own motion.

                  e.	For each text amendment, the proponents of the amendment shall have no less than ten minutes for presentation of data, opinions and evidence at the public hearing, and opponents of the amendment shall likewise have a minimum of ten minutes for presentation. The proponents of each amendment shall have a collective maximum of 20 minutes for their presentations, and the opponents of each amendment likewise shall have a collective maximum of 20 minutes for their presentations, unless these time limitations are waived at the discretion of the presiding official. 
                  f.	At the public hearing on the text amendment or at their next regular meeting, the zoning board shall make its recommendation or take such other action as it may deem appropriate. 
                  1.	A motion to recommend approval or denial of an amendment must be approved by an affirmative vote of at least a quorum of the members in order for the motion to be approved. 
                  2.	If a motion to recommend approval of an amendment fails, the amendment is automatically failed, another motion would be in order. 
                  3.	A tie note on a motion re recommend for denial. If a motion to recommend denial of an amendment fails, another motion would be in order.

The proponents of each amendment shall have a collective maximum of 20 minutes for their presentations, and the opponents of each amendment likewise shall have a collective maximum of 20 minutes for their presentations, unless these time limitations are waived at the discretion of the presiding official.

                  g.	After the public hearing and presentation by the planning and zoning department, action shall be considered by vote of the city council.

                  3.	In the event of a tie vote, the mayor may cast a vote. If there is a tie vote with the mayor's vote, or in the absence of the mayor on a motion for approval of an amendment shall be deemed a denial of the amendment. A tie vote on any other motion shall be deemed to be no action, and another motion would be in order. 
                  4.	If no action is taken on an amendment, it shall be considered tabled and action deferred to the next regular meeting of the city council.

                  d.	Does the proposed amendment reasonably promote the public health, safety, morality or general welfare? 
                  (6)	Effect. 
                  a.	For a property on which a use, building, structure or other improvements existed in conformity with this zoning ordinance prior to the effective date of a text amendment affecting the property, any such use, building, structure or other improvements no longer in conformance shall be governed under the provisions of nonconforming uses in article I of this zoning ordinance. 
                  b.	Construction of any use, building, structure or other improvements for which a building permit has been issued in conformity with this zoning ordinance prior to the effective date of a text amendment may continue to completion as though no change had occurred and, upon completion, shall be governed under the provisions for nonconforming uses in article I of this zoning ordinance, as applicable.
