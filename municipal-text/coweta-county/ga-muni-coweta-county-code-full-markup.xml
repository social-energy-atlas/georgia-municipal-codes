         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE                   This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of Coweta County, Georgia. 
                  Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1985 Code, as supplemented through February 1995, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the board of commissioners. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1985 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
                  This 2006 republication includes all amendatory legislation through ordinances of Jan. 5, 2006, and was accomplished under the supervision of Mary Summers, Editor. 
                  The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
                  Chapter and Section Numbering System 
                  The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
                  Page Numbering System 
                  The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

                   
                  Indexes 
                  The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
                  Looseleaf Supplements 
                  A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
                  Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
                  Acknowledgments 
                  This publication was under the direct supervision of Palmer Carr, Supervising Editor, and Laura Johnson, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida.

                  SUPPLEMENT HISTORY TABLE 
                  The table below allows users of this Code to quickly and accurately determine what ordinances have been considered for codification in each supplement.

                  In addition, by adding to this table with each supplement, users of this Code of Ordinances will be able to gain a more complete picture of the Code's historical evolution.

                  Editor's note— Printed herein is 1872 Ga. Laws, page 405 which established the board of commissioners of the county. Amendments to the act are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original act. Obvious misspellings have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes, a uniform system of headings, catchlines and citations to state statutes has been used. Additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets. 
                  Code reference— Board of commissioners, § 2-31 et seq. 

                  Sec. 1. - Established; terms. 
                  There shall be established in the county of Coweta, in this State, a board of commissioners, to consist of five persons, to be elected by the voters of the county, and commissioned by the Governor; the first election to be held for such commissioners shall take place at the next general election for county officers for the various counties in this State held after the passage of this act, and such commissioners, so elected, shall hold their term of office for four years, except that vacancies may occur by death or resignation; said commissioners shall be exempt from militia and jury duty. 
                  Sec. 1A. - Vacancies. 
                  When a vacancy occurs in the office of the governing authority, and the unexpired term of office exceeds six months in duration, it shall be the duty of the judge of the probate court of the county to call a special election to elect a successor and fill the vacancy in not less than 30 or more than 60 days. The election shall be held as provided by law, and the cost of the election shall be defrayed by the governing authority. If the unexpired term to be filled is less than six months in duration, the judge of the superior court of the county shall have the power to appoint a successor to fill the unexpired term. In any event, the successor shall be a resident of the district wherein the vacancy exists.

                  Editor's note— Section 1A of this compilation was enacted as section 4 of 1906 Ga. Laws, page 399. 2003 Ga. Laws, page 4716, provides for a board of elections of Coweta County to relieve the judge of the probate court from certain responsibilities. 
                  Sec. 1B. - Election.

At said election in the year 1908 three of said commissioners then elected shall hold office for a term of four years and until their successors are elected and qualified, and the remaining two commissioners elected at said time shall hold office for a term of two years and until their successors are elected and qualified. After said election for commissioners in the year 1908, and thereafter, two and three commissioners shall be elected alternately and biennially at the same time other county officers are elected, and shall hold office for a term of four years and until their successors are elected and qualified. At the first meeting of the board of commissioners in the year 1909, the commissioners elected at the election held in the year 1908 shall cast lots and determine which of said commissioners shall hold office for two years and which of said commissioners shall hold office for four years. 
                  (1906 Ga. Laws, page 399) 
                  Editor's note— Section 1B of this compilation was enacted as section 2 of 1906 Ga. Laws, page 399. 
                  Sec. 2. - Districts. 
                  For the purpose of electing members of the Board of Commissioners of Coweta County, Coweta County is divided into five districts. 
                  For purposes of this section: 
                  (1)  The terms "Tract," "Block," and "VTD" shall mean and describe the same geographical boundaries as provided in the report of the Bureau of the Census for the United States decennial census of 1990 for the State of Georgia; 
                  (2)  The term "Precinct" is synonymous with the term "voting precinct" and means a geographical area designated by Article 7 of Chapter 2 or 3 of Title 21 of the O.C.G.A., within which all electors vote at one polling place; 
                  (3)  Whenever the description of any commissioner district refers to a named city, it shall mean the geographical boundaries of that city as shown on the census map for the United States decennial census of 1990 for the State of Georgia; 
                  (4)  Precinct names and designations following VTD designations are included for convenience only; and in the event the description of any commissioner district contains a conflict between the geographical boundaries of any VTD and the boundaries of the following named precinct, the geographical boundary of the VTD as shown on the census maps for the United States decennial census of 1990 for the State of Georgia shall control; 
                  (5)  Any part of Coweta County which is not included in any commissioner district described in this section shall be included within that commissioner district contiguous to such part which contains the least population according to the United States decennial census of 1990 for the State of Georgia; and 
                  (6)  Any part of Coweta County which is described in this section as being included in a particular commissioner district shall nevertheless not be included within such commissioner district if such part is not contiguous to such commissioner district. Such noncontiguous part shall instead be included within that commissioner district contiguous to such part which contains the least population according to the United States decennial census of 1990 for the State of Georgia." 
                  (1906 Ga. Laws, page 399; 1917 Ga. Laws, page 341; 1972 Ga. Laws, page 2388; 1984 Ga. Laws, page 3694; 1992 Ga. Laws, page 4889; 2002 Ga. Laws, page 3810; 2012 Ga. Laws, page 3509) 
                  Editor's note— Section 2 of the original act establishing a board of commissioners of the county expired by its own terms. Section 2 of this compilation derives from 1906 Ga. Laws, page 399, § 3, as amended, and is inserted at this location in the text to maintain continuity. At the request of the County, the district data is not set out herein. District maps may be viewed on the County's website or at the County Administration office. 
                  Sec. 3. - Residency; oath. 
                  No person is eligible as commissioner under this act unless he has been a resident citizen of this State for twelve months, and of the county at least six months next preceding his qualification; before entering upon the duties of his office, he shall take the oath of office required to be taken by the civil officers of this State.

                  Editor's note— Commissioners are eligible to receive longevity increases and cost of living increases under Georgia state law. 
                  Sec. 4. - Quorum. 
                  It shall require three of said commissioners to form a quorum for the transaction of business, and they must concur to pass any order or decree.

                  Sec. 13. - Same; proceeds of bonds. 
                  The proceeds of such bonds shall be used solely for the payment of the cost of the project or projects, and unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture, additional bonds may in like manner be issued to provide the amount of any deficit for the cost of the project or projects, which unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture shall be deemed to be of the same issue and shall be entitled to payment from the same fund without preference or priority of the bonds first issued for the same purposes. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue shall exceed the amount required for the purpose for which such bonds are issued, the surplus shall be paid into a sinking fund or used for additional construction as may be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture. 
                  Sec. 14. - Same; interim receipts and certificates or temporary bonds. 
                  Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the Authority may, under like restrictions issue interim receipts, interim certificates or temporary bonds, with or without coupons exchangeable for definitive bonds upon the issuance of the latter. 
                  Sec. 15. - Same; replacement of lost or mutilated bonds.

In the discretion of the Authority, revenue bonds of a single issue may be issued for the purpose of any particular project. Any resolution, providing for the issuance of revenue bonds under the provisions of this act shall become effective immediately upon its passage and need not be published or posted, and any such resolution may be passed at any regular or special or adjourned meeting of the Authority by a majority of the quorum as in this act provided. 
                  Sec. 17. - Credit not pledged. 
                  Revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this act shall not be deemed to constitute a debt of Coweta County, or any municipality therein, but such bonds shall be payable solely from the fund hereinafter provided for and the issuance of such revenue bonds shall not directly, indirectly or contingently obligate the said county, or any municipality therein, to levy or to pledge any form of taxation whatever therefor or to make any appropriation for the payment, and all such bonds shall contain recitals on their face covering substantially the foregoing provisions of this section. 
                  Sec. 18. - Same; trust indenture as security. 
                  In the discretion of the Authority, any issue of such revenue bonds may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the Authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the state. Such trust indenture may pledge or assign fees, tolls, revenues and earnings to be received by the Authority, including the proceeds derived from the sale from time to time of any surplus property of the Authority, both real and personal. Either the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or such trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the Authority in relation to the acquisition of property, the construction of the project, the maintenance, operation, repair and insurance of the property, and the custody, safeguarding and application of all monies, including the proceeds derived from the sale of property of the Authority, both real and personal, and may also provide that any project shall be constructed and paid for under the supervision and approval of consulting engineers or architects employed or designated by the Authority, and satisfactory to the original purchasers of the bonds issued therefor and may also require that the security given by contractors and by any depository of the proceeds of the bonds or revenues or other monies be satisfactory to such purchasers, and may also contain provisions concerning the conditions, if any, upon which additional revenue bonds may be issued. It shall be lawful for any bond or trust company incorporated under the laws of this state to act as such depository and to furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the Authority. Such indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee, and may restrict the individual right of action of bondholders as is customary in trust indentures securing bonds and debentures of corporations. In addition to the foregoing, such trust indenture may contain such other provisions as the Authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation and repair of the project affected by such indenture. 
                  Sec. 19. - Same; to whom proceeds of bonds shall be paid. 
                  The Authority shall, in the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or in [the] trust indenture, provide for the payment of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds to any officer or person who, or any agency, bank or trust company which, shall act as trustee of such funds and shall hold and apply the same to the purposes hereof, subject to such regulations as this act and such resolutions or trust indenture may provide. 
                  Sec. 20. - Same; sinking fund. 
                  The revenues, fees, tolls, and earnings derived from any particular project or projects, regardless of whether or not such fees, earnings and revenues were produced by a particular project for which bonds have been issued and any monies derived from the sale of any properties, both real and personal of the Authority, unless otherwise pledged and allocated, may be pledged and allocated by the Authority to the payment of the principal and interest on revenue bonds of the Authority as the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust instrument may provide, and such funds so pledged from whatever source received, which said pledge may include funds received from one (1) or more or all sources, shall be set aside at regular intervals as may be provided in the resolution or trust indenture, into a sinking fund which said sinking fund shall be pledged to and charged with the payments of (1) the interest upon such revenue bonds as such interest shall fall due, (2) the principal of the bonds as the same shall fall due, (3) the necessary charges of paying agent or agents for paying interest and principal and (4) any premium upon bonds retired by call or purchase as hereinabove provided. The use and disposition of such sinking fund shall be subject to such regulations as may be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, but, except as may otherwise be provided in such resolution or trust indenture, such sinking fund shall be a fund for the benefit of all revenue bonds without distinction or priority of one over another. Subject to the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or the trust indenture surplus monies in the sinking fund may be applied to the purchase or redemption of bonds and any such bonds so purchased or redeemed shall forthwith be cancelled and shall not again be issued. 
                  Sec. 21. - Same; remedies of bondholders.

                  Sec. 22. - Same; refunding bonds. 
                  The Authority is hereby authorized to provide by resolution for the issue of revenue bonds of the Authority for the purpose of refunding any revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this act and then outstanding, together with accrued interest thereon. The issuance of such revenue refunding bonds, the maturities and all other details thereof, the rights of the holders thereof, and the duties of the Authority in respect to the same, shall be governed by the foregoing provisions of this act insofar as the same may be applicable. 
                  Sec. 23. - Same; validation.

                  Sec. 24. - Same; venue and jurisdiction. 
                  Any action to protect or enforce any rights under the provisions of this act or any suit or action against such Authority shall be brought in the superior court of Coweta County, Georgia, and any action pertaining to validation of any bonds issued under the provisions of this act shall likewise be brought in said court which shall have exclusive, original jurisdiction of such actions. 
                  Sec. 25. - Same; interest of bondholders protected.

                  All monies received pursuant to the authority of this act, whether as proceeds from the sale of revenue bonds, as grants or other contributions, or as revenues, income, fees and earnings, shall be deemed to be trust funds to be held and applied solely as provided in this act.

Thereafter, there shall be conducted biennially, not later than 60 days following the last day for filing ad valorem real property tax returns in Coweta County, a caucus of such electors at such time and place within the district as the board shall designate in such notice for the purpose of electing board members to those board member positions whose terms are expiring or are vacant. If a vacancy occurs in an elected position on the board, the board shall, within 60 days thereof, call a special election to fill the same which shall be held within 60 days of the call unless such vacancy occurs within 180 days of the next regularly scheduled election, in which case a special election may, but need not, be called. For any election held under this act, notice thereof shall be given to such electors by publishing notice thereof in the legal organ of Coweta County on four dates: at least 45 days, 31 days, 17 days, and ten days, respectively, prior to such election.

The new appointed board member in such case shall take office, representing Post 7, upon the appointment by such governing authority. 
                  (f)  O.C.G.A. tit. 21, ch. 2, the "Georgia Election Code," shall not apply to the election of district board members. Should a vacancy in office of a district board member occur, and the regular caucus of electors is more than six months in the future, a special election shall be called to fill such vacancy, unless filled by appointment as provided in this act. The district board may adopt such bylaws not inconsistent herewith to provide for any matter concerning such elections.

The proceeds of taxes, fees, and assessments levied by the board shall be used only for the purpose of providing governmental services and facilities which are specifically required by the degree of density of development within the district and not for the purpose of providing those governmental services and facilities provided to Coweta County or the municipality as a whole. Any tax, fee, or assessment so levied shall be collected by the Coweta County Tax Commissioner in the same manner as taxes, fees, and assessments are levied by Coweta County. Delinquent taxes shall bear the same interest and penalties as Coweta County ad valorem taxes and may be enforced and collected in the same manner. The proceeds of taxes, fees, and assessments so levied, less a fee to cover the costs of collection of 1 percent thereof, but not more than $25,000.00 in any one calendar year, shall be transmitted as soon as they are acquired by the Coweta County Tax Commissioner to the district board and shall be expended by the board only for the purposes authorized hereby. 
                  (b)  The board shall levy the taxes provided for in subsection (a) of this section subsequent to the report of the assessed taxable values for the current calendar year and notify in writing the collecting governing bodies so they may include the levy on their regular ad valorem tax bills, if possible.

                  (b)  The boundaries of the district or districts may be increased after the initial creation of a district pursuant to the following:

                  (1)  The adoption of a resolution consenting to the annexation by the board of the district; and 
                  (2)  The adoption of a resolution consenting to the annexation by the governing authority of Coweta County if any portion of the district is or is to be in the unincorporated area of Coweta County, and the governing authority of such municipalities as may have area within the district before or after the annexation.

                  (b)  The provisions of this chapter are ordained under and by virtue of the authority granted by the laws of the State of Georgia, O.C.G.A.

The request for review must be filed within 45 days from the date the tax is paid.

                  (1)  Sexually oriented businesses, as a category of commercial uses, are associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects including, but not limited to, personal and property crimes, prostitution, potential spread of disease, lewdness, public indecency, obscenity, illicit drug use and drug trafficking, negative impacts on surrounding properties, urban blight, litter, and sexual assault and exploitation. 
                  (2)  Sexually oriented businesses should be separated from sensitive land uses to minimize the impact of their secondary effects upon such uses, and should be separated from other sexually oriented businesses, to minimize the secondary effects associated with such uses and to prevent an unnecessary concentration of sexually oriented businesses in one area. 
                  (3)  Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm which the county has a substantial government interest in preventing and/or abating. This substantial government interest in preventing secondary effects, which is the county's rationale for this article, exists independent of any comparative analysis between sexually oriented and non-sexually oriented businesses. Additionally, the county's interest in regulating sexually oriented businesses extends to preventing future secondary effects of either current or future sexually oriented businesses that may locate in the county. The county finds that the cases and documentation relied on in this article are reasonably believed to be relevant to said secondary effects. 
                  The county hereby adopts and incorporates herein its stated findings and legislative record related to the adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses, including the judicial opinions and reports related to such secondary effects.

At the conclusion of said two years, the use will no longer be recognized as a lawful nonconforming use, provided that a nonconforming sexually oriented business may apply for one or more six-month extensions of the original two-year period upon a showing of financial hardship. An application for an initial extension based upon financial hardship ("hardship exception") shall be made at least 60 days before the conclusion of the aforementioned two-year period.

                  (1)  Surface mining, as the same is defined in O.C.G.A. 12-4-72, "The Georgia Surface Mining Act of 1968". 
                  (2)  Granite quarrying and land clearing for such quarrying; 
                  (3)  Such minor land disturbing activities as home gardens and individual home landscaping, repairs, maintenance work, fences, and other related activities, which result in minor soil erosion; 
                  (4)  The construction of single-family residences, when such construction disturbs less than one acre and is not a part of a larger common plan of development or sale with a planned disturbance of equal to or greater than one acre and not otherwise exempted under this paragraph; provided, however, that construction of any such residence shall conform to the minimum requirements as set forth in O.C.G.A. 12-7-6 and this paragraph. For single-family residence construction covered by the provisions of this paragraph, there shall be a buffer zone between the residence and any state waters classified as trout streams pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of the Georgia Water Quality Control Act. In any such buffer zone, no land disturbing activity shall be constructed between the residence and the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action from the banks of the trout waters. For primary trout waters, the buffer zone shall be at least 50 horizontal feet, and no variance to a smaller buffer shall be granted. For secondary trout waters, the buffer zone shall be at least 50 horizontal feet, but the director may grant variances to no less than 25 feet. Regardless of whether a trout stream is primary or secondary, for first order trout waters, which are streams into which no other streams flow except for springs, the buffer shall be at least 25 horizontal feet, and no variance to a smaller buffer shall be granted. The minimum requirements of O.C.G.A 12-7-6(b) and the buffer zones provided by this paragraph shall be enforced by the local issuing authority. 
                  (5)  Agricultural operations as defined in O.C.G.A. 1-3-3, "definitions", to include raising, harvesting or storing of products of the field or orchard; feeding, breeding or managing livestock or poultry; producing or storing feed for use in the production of livestock, including, but not limited to, cattle, calves, swine, hogs, goats, sheep, and rabbits or for use in the production of poultry, including, but not limited to, chicken, hens and turkeys; producing plants, trees, fowl, or animals; the production of aquaculture, horticultural, dairy, livestock, poultry, eggs and apiarian products; farms buildings and farm ponds; 
                  (6)  Forestry land management practices, including harvesting; provided, however, that when such exempt forestry practices cause or result in land disturbing or other activities otherwise prohibited in a buffer, as established in subsection 30-34(c)(15) and (16) of this article, no other land disturbing activities, except for normal forest management practices, shall be allowed on the entire property upon which the forestry practices were conducted for a period of three years after completion of such forestry practices; 
                  (7)  Any project carried out under the technical supervision of the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) of the United States Department of Agriculture; 
                  (8)  Any project involving less than one acre of disturbed area; provided, however, that this exemption shall not apply to any land disturbing activity within a larger common plan of development or sale with a planned disturbance of equal to or greater than one acre or within 200 feet of the bank of any state waters, and for purposes of this paragraph, "state waters" excludes channels and drainageways which have water in them only during and immediately after rainfall events and intermittent streams which do not have water in them year-round; provided, however, that any person responsible for a project which involves less than one acre, which involves land disturbing activity, and which is within 200 feet of any such excluded channel or drainageway, must prevent sediment from moving beyond the boundaries of the property on which such project is located and provided, further, that nothing contained herein shall prevent the local issuing authority from regulating any such project which is not specifically exempted by paragraphs (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (9) or (10) of this section; 
                  (9)  Construction or maintenance projects, or both, undertaken or financed in whole or in part, or both, by the department of transportation, the Georgia Highway Authority, or the state road and tollway authority; or any road construction or maintenance project, or both, undertaken by any county or municipality; provided, however, that construction or maintenance projects of the department of transportation or the state road and tollway authority which disturb one or more contiguous acres of land shall be subject to provisions of O.C.G.A 12-7-7.1; except where the department of transportation, the Georgia Highway Authority, or the state road and tollway authority is a secondary permittee for a project located within a larger common plan of development or sale under the state general permit, in which case a copy of a notice of intent under the state general permit shall be submitted to the local issuing authority, the local issuing authority shall enforce compliance with the minimum requirements set forth in O.C.G.A 12-7-6 as if a permit had been issued, and violations shall be subject to the same penalties as violations by permit holders; 
                  (10)  Any land disturbing activities conducted by any electric membership corporation or municipal electrical system or any public utility under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Public Service Commission, any utility under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, any cable television system as defined in O.C.G.A. 36-18-1, or any agency or instrumentality of the United States engaged in the generation, transmission, or distribution of power; except where an electric membership corporation or municipal electrical system or any public utility under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Public Service Commission, any utility under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, any cable television system as defined in O.C.G.A. 36-18-1, or any agency or instrumentality of the United States engaged in the generation, transmission or distribution of power is a secondary permittee for a project located within a larger common plan of development or sale under the state general permit, in which case the local issuing authority shall enforce compliance with the minimum requirements set forth in O.C.G.A. 12-7-6 as if a permit had been issued, and violations shall be subject to the same penalties as violations by permit holders; and

                  (Ord. No. 043-09, 12-15-09; Ord. No. 007-10, 5-18-10; 001-17, 1-5-17) 
                  Sec. 30-34. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices. 
                  (a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land disturbing activities if requirements of the ordinance and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land disturbing activities which are not exempted by this ordinance shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections 30-34(b) and (c) of this article. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit. 
                  (b)  Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
                  (1)  Best management practices as set forth in subsections 30-34(b) and (c) of this article shall be required for all land disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection, the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia specified in O.C.G.A. 12-7-6(b). 
                  (2)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes, which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the Board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
                  (5)  The local issuing authority may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsections 30-34(c)(15) and (16), in light of O.C.G.A. 12-7-6 (c). 
                  (c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading, and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected, and supplemented; 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  (7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control measures shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. 12-7-1 et seq.; 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)  Land disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection 30-34(b)(2) of this article; 
                  (15)  Except as provided in paragraph (16) of this subsection there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the groundwater table year round; for which groundwater is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow, unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetation cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetation cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
                  (i)  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
                  (ii)  Stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-5-2, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge and average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.  No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
                  (i)  Stream crossings for water lines: or 
                  (ii)  Stream crossings for sewer lines. 
                  (d)  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections 30-34(b) and (c) of this article; 
                  (e)  The fact that land disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
                  (Ord. No. 043-09, 12-15-09; Ord. No. 007-10, 5-18-10; Ord. No. 001-17, 1-5-17) 
                  Sec. 30-35. - Application/permit process. 
                  (a)  General. The property owner, developer, and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
                  (b)  Application requirements. 
                  (1)  No person shall conduct any land disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of Coweta County without first obtaining a permit from the planning and zoning department to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
                  (2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the planning and zoning department and must include the applicant's erosion and sedimentation control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection 30-35(c) of this article. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of subsections 30-34(b) and (c) of this article will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by six copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-10. 
                  (3)  A fee in the amount of $65.00 shall be charged for each acre or fraction thereof in the project area. 
                  (4)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-5-23(a)5., provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-8(a), half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to paragraph 9 or 10 of O.C.G.A. 12-7-17 shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  (5)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by subsections 30-34(c)(15) and (16) has been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per subsection 30-35(b)(7), have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
                  (6)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this article section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing of the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
                  (7)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this ordinance or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  (c)  Plan requirements. 
                  (1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in subsections 30-34(b) and (c) of this article, or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this article. The plan for the land disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and stormwater management facilities, local ordinances, and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computation shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-20. 
                  (2)  Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land disturbing activity was permitted. 
                  (d)  Permits. 
                  (1)  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary, and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
                  (2)  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this article, any variances required by subsection 30-34(c)(15) and (16) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per subsection 30-35(b)(7) are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
                  (3)  Any land disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this article, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
                  (4)  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
                  (5)  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this article. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
                  (6)  The local issuing authority may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. 12-7-7(f)(1). 
                  (7)  The actual land disturbance permit will be delivered at a pre-construction meeting held between the county inspector for the project and the operator. The operator shall schedule pre-construction meetings through the development and engineering department.

                  Sec. 30-36. - Inspection and enforcement. 
                  (a)  The transportation and engineering department or other authorized county agent will periodically inspect the sites of land disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article. 
                  (b)  The local issuing authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within 12 months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975. 
                  (c)  The transportation and engineering department or other authorized county agent, shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this article, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land disturbing activities.

                  ARTICLE IV. - POST-DEVELOPMENT STORMWATER MANAGEMENT FOR NEW DEVELOPMENT AND REDEVELOPMENT 

                  Sec. 30-91. - Title 
                  This article shall be known as the "Post-Development Stormwater Management for New Development and Redevelopment Ordinance of Coweta County". 
                  (Ord. of 3-1-05) 
                  Sec. 30-92. - Introduction 
                  It is hereby determined that: 
                  Land development projects and other land use conversions, and their associated changes to land cover, permanently alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, which in turn increase flooding, stream channel erosion, and sediment transport and deposition; 
                  Land development projects and other land use conversions also contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters; 
                  The impacts of post-development stormwater runoff quantity and quality can adversely affect public safety, public and private property, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters; 
                  These adverse impacts can be controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff quantity and quality from new development and redevelopment, by the use of both structural facilities as well as nonstructural measures, such as the conservation of open space and greenspace areas. The preservation and protection of natural area and greenspace for stormwater management benefits is encouraged through the use of incentives or "credits." The Georgia Greenspace Program provides a mechanism for the preservation and coordination of those greenspace areas which provide stormwater management quality and quantity benefits; 
                  Localities in the State of Georgia are required to comply with a number of both state and federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of post-development stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution; 
                  Therefore, Coweta County has established this set of stormwater management policies to provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of post-development stormwater runoff for the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation. It has determined that it is in the public interest to regulate post-development stormwater runoff discharges in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes, post-construction soil erosion and sedimentation, stream channel erosion, and nonpoint source pollution associated with post-development stormwater runoff. 
                  (Ord. of 3-1-05) 
                  Sec. 30-93. - General provisions. 
                  30-93.1. Purpose and intent. The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-development stormwater runoff and nonpoint source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment. It has been determined that proper management of post-development stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety, environment and general welfare of the public, and protect water and aquatic resources. This article seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives: 
                  (1)  Establish decision-making processes surrounding land development activities that protect the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources; 
                  (2)  Require that new development and redevelopment maintain the pre-development hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as practicable in order to reduce flooding, streambank erosion, nonpoint source pollution and increases in stream temperature, and maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats; 
                  (3)  Establish minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality; 
                  (4)  Establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater control facilities that can be used to meet the minimum post-development stormwater management standards; 
                  (5)  Encourage the use of nonstructural stormwater management and stormwater better site design practices, such as the preservation of greenspace and other conservation areas, to the maximum extent practicable. Coordinate site design plans, which include greenspace, with the county's greenspace protection plan; 
                  (6)  Establish provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of structural stormwater control facilities and nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained, and pose no threat to public safety; and 
                  (7)  Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans, and for the inspection of approved active projects, and long-term follow up. 
                  30-93.2. Applicability. 
                  (1)  This article shall be applicable to all land development, including, but not limited to, site plan applications, subdivision applications, and grading applications, unless exempt pursuant to subsection (2) below. These standards apply to any new development or redevelopment site that meets one or more of the following criteria: 
                  a.  New development that involves the creation of 5,000 square feet or more of impervious cover, or that involves other land development activities of one acre or more; 
                  b.  Redevelopment that includes the creation, addition or replacement of 5,000 square feet or more of impervious cover, or that involves other land development activity of one acre or more; 
                  c.  Any new development or redevelopment, regardless of size, that is defined by the director of development and engineering to be a hotspot land use; or 
                  d.  Land development activities that are smaller than the minimum applicability criteria set forth in items a. and b. above if such activities are part of a larger common plan of development, even though multiple, separate and distinct land development activities may take place at different times on different schedules. 
                  (2)  The following activities are exempt from this article: 
                  a.  Individual single-family or duplex residential lots that are not part of a subdivision or phased development project; 
                  b.  Additions or modifications to existing single-family or duplex residential structures; 
                  c.  Agricultural or silvicultural land management activities within areas zoned for these activities; and 
                  d.  Repairs to any stormwater management facility or practice deemed necessary by the director of development and engineering.

                  ARTICLE V. - ILLICIT DISCHARGE AND ILLEGAL CONNECTION 

                  Sec. 30-201. - Title. 
                  This article shall be known as the "Illicit Discharge and Illegal Connection Ordinance of Coweta County". 
                  (Ord. of 3-1-05) 
                  Sec. 30-202. - Introduction. 
                  It is hereby determined that: 
                  Discharges to the Coweta County separate storm sewer system that are not composed entirely of stormwater runoff contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters; 
                  These non-stormwater discharges occur due to spills, dumping and improper connections to the Coweta County separate storm sewer system from residential, industrial, commercial or institutional establishments. 
                  These non-stormwater discharges not only impact waterways individually, but geographically dispersed, small volume non-stormwater discharges can have cumulative impacts on receiving waters. 
                  The impacts of these discharges adversely affect public health and safety, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters; 
                  These impacts can be minimized through the regulation of spills, dumping and discharges into the Coweta County separate storm sewer system; 
                  Localities in the State of Georgia are required to comply with a number of State and Federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution due to improper non-stormwater discharges to the Coweta County separate storm sewer system; 
                  Therefore, the Coweta County Commissioners adopts this ordinance to prohibit such non-stormwater discharges to the Coweta County separate storm sewer system. It is determined that the regulation of spills, improper dumping and discharges to the Coweta County separate storm sewer system is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety, and the environment.

                  ARTICLE VI. - DROUGHT CONTINGENCY PLAN 

                  Sec. 30-221. - Definitions. 
                  Act refers to the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, O.C.G.A. § 12-5-31. 
                  Regulation shall refer to chapter 391-3-6-.07 of regulations promulgated by the Environmental Protection Division (EPD) of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources (DNR) and approved by the board of DNR. 
                  Newnan utilities shall refer to the City of Newnan Water, Sewer and Light Commission. 
                  Drought shall mean a climatic event, when rainfall is below average. The identification of drought conditions requires an adequate definition of drought for the regional area. Generally, drought conditions occur when the water demand exceeds water supply. Water storage is comprised of stream flow, reservoir and lake capacity, and groundwater recharge and is dependent upon numerous factors such as precipitation and land use. Water demand is dependent on factors such as agriculture, climate, population, industry, navigation, recreation and environmental uses. Drought management should therefore address issues in both supply-side and demand-side water management. 
                  Drought condition indicators are those indices developed to measure levels of drought severity based on meteorology, hydrology or a combination of factors. Indicators establish a baseline for normal conditions and quantitative measures for variations from those baselines. 
                  Farm uses as defined by the Act shall mean irrigation of any land used for general farming, forage, aquaculture, pasture, turf production, orchards or tree and ornamental nurseries; provisions of water supply for farm animals, poultry farming, or another activity conducted in the course of farming operations. Farm uses shall also include the processing of perishable agricultural products. Farm use shall not include the irrigation of recreational turf. 
                  Reservoir volumes shall refer to the combined volume of all Newnan Utilities reservoirs supplying Coweta County with drinking water. This includes Reservoirs Nos. 1—6, Sandy/Brown Creek Reservoir and J.T. Haynes. These reservoirs are supplies by withdrawals from Line Creek, White Oak Creek and Sandy/Brown Creek. 
                  Recycle/Reuse/Reclaimed Water will include, but are not limited to those waters that are recycled by water users on-site within processes or treated wastewater delivered from an outside source. Recycled water uses include irrigation, cooling tower, industrial process and washdown. 
                  Stream flow monitoring will be based on data from Newnan Utilities' stream gauge located on Line Creek and White Oak Creek. 
                  7Q10 flow shall mean that lowest average stream flow expected to occur for seven consecutive days with an average frequency of once in ten years. 
                  (Ord. of 4-25-00) 
                  Sec. 30-222. - Drought indicators. 
                  Two types of data are available to determine the severity of a drought: 
                  Reservoir volumes departure from the design drought level is probably the most important indicator that a drought is serious and extra conservation measures are in order. The reservoir volumes used to determine drought levels are based on seasonal conditions and water demands. It is necessary to sustain higher reservoir volumes as the summer months begin in order to have adequate water supply during the hottest months of the year. Reservoir volumes will normally begin to decrease as the summer progresses because rainfall is low and usage is high. Lower reservoir volumes are thereby anticipated during the fall and winter seasons. The lowest volumes are usually found within the months of December and January. Precipitation aids in replenishing the water supply during the wet spring months and therefore the reservoirs should typically have ample water supply in summer season. 
                  Figure 1.1 and Table 1.1 represent expected seasonal variations in volume for the combined reservoirs. Combined reservoir volumes for drought levels were designed to take into account these seasonal variations. 
                  Stream flow is probably one of the better indicators of drought conditions. The stream flow gage located on Line Creek near the water intake is maintained by Newnan Utilities and will be monitored during periods of low flow to serve as a data source. 
                  The EPD currently accepts the 7Q10 flow criteria for monitoring drought. Drought levels are triggered when flow for the designated drought period drops below the designated 7Q10 stream flow for that drought level. Table 1.2 summarizes drought level criteria based on 7Q10 flow. 
                  Table 1.2. Stream Flow Drought Level Criteria 

                   
                  (Ord. of 4-25-00) 
                  Sec. 30-223. - Drought severity level definitions. 
                  Level I Drought is defined as a drought, when combined reservoir volumes are below those shown in Table 1.1 and graphically displayed in Figure 1.1. Alternatively, the county in consultation with Newnan Utilities may consider declaring a Level I Drought if stream flow is below the 7Q10 flow levels for 20 days out of 30 days prior to the current day as summarized in Table 1.2. 
                  Level II Drought is defined by combined reservoir volumes as shown in Table 1.1 and Figure 1.1. Alternatively, the county in consultation with Newnan Utilities may consider declaring a Level II Drought if stream flow is below the 7Q10 flow levels for 50 days of 60 days prior to the current day as summarized in Table 1.2. 
                  Level III Drought is defined by combined reservoir volumes as shown in Table 1.1 and Figure 1.1. Alternatively, the county in consultation with Newnan Utilities may consider declaring a Level III Drought if stream flow is below the 7Q10 flow levels for 77 days out of 90 days prior to the current day as summarized in Table 1.2. 
                  Level IV Drought is defined by combined reservoir volumes as shown in Table 1.1 and Figure 1.1. Alternatively, the county in consultation with Newnan Utilities may consider declaring a Level IV Drought if stream flow is below the 7Q10 flow levels for 85 days out of 120 days prior to the current day as summarized in Table 1.2. 
                  The county will work closely with Newnan Utilities and will also solicit advice from the EPD and/or a consultant, and to use its own judgment prior to declaring the drought emergency level. The above drought level criteria are guidelines only. 
                  (Ord. of 4-25-00) 
                  Sec. 30-224. - Potable water use priorities and demand management schedule. 
                  Water use priorities for potable water are based on the Act and regulation and listed as follows: 
                  (1)  Emergency facilities for essential life support measures; 
                  (2)  Domestic and personal use, including drinking, cooking, washing, sanitary purposes, and health-related activities; 
                  (3)  Farm uses; 
                  (4)  Industrial uses (those industries on public water system); 
                  (5)  Other uses such as lawn sprinkling, noncommercial car washing, garden watering, etc.; 
                  (6)  Outdoor recreational uses. 
                  Under the four levels of drought contingency planning, the following applies as summarized below and in Table 3.1 for potable water use: 
                  Level I: All uses can continue, but with voluntary constraint. The county may institute landscape irrigation restrictions or other demand management strategies. The water consumption reduction goal for Level I is five percent. 
                  Level II: This level would mandate water conservation. Industries would not be curtailed, but would be expected to minimize water consumption. All residential customers will be required to maximize conservation and will be sensitized to the fact that the next step will be severe. The residential water consumption reduction requirement for Level II is ten percent below the consumption in the month prior to imposition of restrictions or the average of the usage in December, January and February, whichever is less. Any consumption above that permitted by this level will be charged the bulk water rate. 
                  Level III: This is the level at which the farm uses will be asked to participate in voluntary water conservation measures. Outdoor watering in residential landscapes will be allowed only once a week by an odd/even day watering system. Commercial and development landscaping will be restricted to outdoor watering once a week as designated by the county. Commercial businesses are expected to implement measures that will reduce their water consumption with a requirement of 25 percent reduction. All industrial users that use proves water are expected to implement conservation measures with a goal of 15 percent less water consumption. Operation of swimming pools and decorative fountains will be limited to use for make-up water. Draining and refilling pools will be prohibited. Water cut-off and fines can be implemented to enforce water conservation requirements. All non-essential water use will be prohibited. The residential water consumption reduction requirement for Level III is 20 percent. 
                  Level IV: At this level, emergency procedures would come into effect, giving priority to potable uses. At this level of drought emergency, all outdoor water use except emergency response and farm uses will be prohibited, mandatory conservation will be in effect, and the county will monitor the situation on a weekly basis. Major industries will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis to evaluate opportunities for optimal water conservation. Violators would be traced through the billing system and observation by county employees, and could face loss of water service. Shutdown of some industries will be mandated as a last resort. The residential water consumption reduction requirement for Level IV is 30 percent. 
                  Enforcement. The county shall reserve the right to terminate water services for repeat violations of emergency water conservation procedures during drought conditions or when it appears that water withdrawal permit limits may be exceeded. Written warnings can be issued for first time violations. A second offense will result in the termination of water service. Service may be restored upon request and payment of a reconnect fee at the water and sewer department office. In the event of a third offense, the violator will be subject to fines or other penalties as dictated by the Coweta County Board of Commissioners that may include action under the Criminal Code of Georgia.

                  Sec. 30-225. - Low-flow protection. 
                  Low-flow data will be monitored by the county in conjunction with Newnan Utilities on a monthly basis for reservoir volumes and during periods of low-flow for stream flow. The data, in conjunction with the guidelines for drought determination above, will be used by the county to evaluate potential drought conditions. 
                  (Ord. of 4-25-00) 
                  Sec. 30-226. - Water storage. 
                  Yield vs. Drought Return Period. The vast majority of the county's water is purchased from Newnan Utilities. Therefore, the management practices and facilities of Newnan Utilities are critical to this drought management plan. The storage reservoirs for City of Newnan's water supplies were designed to store approximately 1,704 million gallons for water treatment. A small amount of additional capacity exists in the reservoirs at the very bottom of each lake, but it would not readily treatable. The seven storage reservoirs are located at the water treatment plant and are replenished through surface water withdrawals from White Oak Creek, Line Creek and Sandy/Brown Creek. Current permits allow a combined maximum day withdrawal of 27 mgd from the creeks and a 14 mgd maximum day withdrawal from the reservoirs. Larger withdrawal limits from the creeks will allow for replenishing the raw water reservoirs after a drought season. 
                  Storage Type. City of Newnan's water supply is stored in seven reservoirs located at the water treatment plant. 

                   
                  Note— This total capacity includes a small amount of non-usable capacity. The usable capacity is 1,704 million gallons. 
                  Alternate Water Sources. Coweta County operates a small groundwater system at Park Timbers. Newnan Utilities currently does not have alternate water sources. The cities of Turin and Sharpsburg utilize groundwater and are not generally affected by water restrictions imposed by this article.

                  (6)  No private shoreline use permits will be issued. 
                  (b)  Buffer requirements. A buffer shall be maintained for a distance of 150 feet from the normal pool elevation of the reservoir. Should questions concerning the normal pool elevation arise, it shall be resolved by an engineering survey on a case-by-case basis. The 150-foot buffer shall not be encroached on by any impervious development. 
                  (c)  Reservoir monitoring. The B.T. Brown Reservoir is owned fee simple by Coweta County, Georgia. Coweta County will be responsible for the management of recreational uses and the buffer requirements. Coweta County shall be responsible for the monitoring of the water quality of the watershed. The county shall establish a monitoring plan as follows: 
                  (1)  General inspection of the B.T. Brown Watershed once every three years to monitor urban and rural development. 
                  (2)  Aerial inspection of the B.T. Brown Watershed once every five years to monitor urban and rural development. 
                  (3)  Establishment of three water quality monitoring points along the perennial streams feeding the reservoir in coordination with GA DNR EPD Water Quality Program. 
                  (4)  Sampling of water samples from the three monitoring points will be coordinated between the county and EPD for report scheduling and parameters with copies of said report filed with the EPD Water Resources Program. 
                  (d)  Enforcement. Violations of the criteria set forth in this plan for protecting the water quality of the B.T. Brown Reservoir shall be enforced by Coweta County, assigns or duly authorized agents. All incidents of littering, water pollution, or any other act which threatens water quality, after the first warning, shall be punishable by the maximum fine of $1,000.00 allowed by law in the Magistrate Court pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 15-10-60 et seq. This is in addition to any other punishment provided by other local, state or federal law.

                  (a)  Policy statement. It is the policy of the board of commissioners that no person shall be excluded from, denied the benefits of or otherwise discriminated against in connection with the award and performance of any contract financed in whole or in part with federal funds under the department of transportation (D.O.T.) financial assistance programs. It is the policy of this board that minority business enterprises, as defined under 49 Code of Federal Regulations Part 23, shall have the maximum opportunity to participate in the bidding and performing of such contracts. 
                  (b)  Liaison officer. A liaison officer will be appointed by the board of commissioners and will report directly to the board. The liaison officer will administer the minority business enterprise (M.B.E.) program and will have the responsibility for carrying out technical assistance activities for dissemination of information to M.B.E. firms on available business opportunities. He also will inform any known M.B.E. organizations of prospective contract work and will see that all known M.B.E.'s are provided an equitable opportunity to bid on D.O.T. assisted contracts. 
                  (c)  Opportunity of M.B.E.'s to compete. 
                  (1)  Advertisement for bids will be published in community newspapers with a statement of the county's nondiscriminatory policy statement included.

                  (d)  Banks controlled by minorities or women. The county has no banks owned or controlled by minorities or women, to the knowledge of the board, at this time. If one or more are opened or discovered to be in existence in the business area of the county, they will be given every consideration and opportunity to compete for the airport business. The county will encourage its prime contracts under D.O.T. assisted projects to utilize to the extent reasonable the services of banks owned and controlled by minorities and women. 
                  (e)  M.B.E. directory. The county, through its liaison officer, will utilize any directory, supplied by the Small Business Administration or by M.B.E. organizations, to distribute proposed project bidding information to those businesses of the type to be involved in such projects in which D.O.T. funds are involved. The county is not staffed to develop a separate directory of M.B.E. firms; therefore, it will utilize any existing directories available. 
                  (f)  Eligibility of M.B.E.'s and joint ventures. To determine, insofar as is reasonable, that its M.B.E. program benefits M.B.E. firms owned and controlled by minorities and women, the airport authority will base its determination upon information provided by the firms on schedules A and B attached to the motion from which this section is derived. Each business desiring to participate as an M.B.E. or as a joint venture in a county D.O.T. assisted contract will complete the applicable schedule A or B, included in the contract package. 
                  (g)  Award of contracts to competitors that meet M.B.E. goals. To the degree feasible and possible under the law, the airport authority will, before awarding a prime contract, review all bids and the composition of these bids with regard to subcontracts and the number of M.B.E.'s participating in both contracts and subcontracts. To the degree possible under these conditions, the goal of the county will be to have at least four percent participation by M.B.E.'s. Any prime contractors who are given consideration for award for bid will have to show that under their M.B.E. policy and contract goals, they have, within reason, met or attempted to meet these goals. 
                  (h)  Identification of M.B.E.'s by competitors. The airport authority will request the proposer/bidder to identify M.B.E.'s that are participating in his project bids, and a list will be maintained through the bid process and will be available for any bidders requesting M.B.E. potential subcontractor information.

The notice shall be presented by both a physical posting on the property in the name of the property owner and by certified mail or personal delivery to the owner or owners as their names and addresses are shown on the tax records of the county.

                  h.  An estimate of the total cost, based on the schedule of charges, if the violation is remedied by the county. Such estimate is not to be interpreted or construed as the final cost which may be assessed, but only a good-faith approximation of such cost. The final assessable cost may be greater or lesser than the estimate. 
                  i.  A statement that the record owner of the property may, within 30 calendar days from the date of the notice, make a written request for a hearing before the chief building official for the purpose of showing that the cited condition does not constitute a violation.

                  Such lien shall be in favor of Coweta County, Georgia, and may be satisfied at any time by payment thereof including accrued interest.

                  (f)  Administrative charge; administrative penalty; additional violations.

                  (1)  Any development impact fee imposed pursuant to this article shall not exceed a project's proportionate share of the cost of system improvements, shall be calculated on the basis of the establishment of service areas, and shall be calculated on the basis of levels of service for public facilities that are the same for existing development as for new growth and development, as established in the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan. 
                  (2)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this article, the calculation of impact fees shall be net of credits for the present value of ad valorem taxes or other revenues as established in the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan, and which: 
                  a.  Are reasonably expected to be generated by new growth and development; and 
                  b.  Are reasonably expected on the basis of historical funding patterns to be made available to pay for system improvements of the same category and in the same service area for which an impact fee is imposed. 
                  (3)  The method of calculating impact fees for public facilities under this article shall be maintained for public inspection as a part of the official records of Coweta County, Georgia, and may be amended from time to time by official act. 
                  (4)  In addition to the cost of new or expanded system improvements needed to be built to serve new development, the cost basis of a development impact fee may also include the proportionate cost of existing system improvements to the extent that such public facilities have excess service capacity and new development will be served by such facilities, as established in the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan. 
                  (5)  Development impact fees shall be based on actual system improvement costs or reasonable estimates of such costs, as set forth in the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan.

                  Sec. 50-75. - Fee assessment and payment. 
                  (a)  Fee schedule. 
                  (1)  Payment of a development impact fee pursuant to the fee schedule attached hereto [(Ord. of 4-4-06(1)] and incorporated herein as Exhibit 1 for a property located inside of Coweta County, shall constitute full and complete payment of the project's proportionate share of system improvements as individually levied by Coweta County, and shall be deemed to be in compliance with the requirements of this article. 
                  (2)  When a land development activity for which an application for a building permit has been made includes two or more buildings, structures or other land uses in any combination, including two or more uses within a building or structure, the total development impact fee shall be the sum of the fees for each and every building, structure, or use, including each and every use within a building or structure. 
                  (3)  In the event that an applicant contends that the land use category of the proposed development is not shown on the fee schedule or fits within a different category, then: 
                  a.  The administrator in his or her sole discretion shall make a determination as to the appropriate land use designation and the appropriate development impact fee. 
                  b.  In making such determination, the administrator may require such additional information from the applicant as necessary to form a logical fee determination relative to the impact fees shown on the adopted fee schedule. 
                  c.  If a land use designation is not in a category contained in this article, then an appropriate new category may be added by the administrator and an appropriate fee established under the county's current impact fee methodology, subject to annual confirmation by the board of commissioners. 
                  d.  Appeals from the decision of the administrator shall be made to the board of commissioners in accordance with the administrative appeals section of this article. 
                  (b)  Timing of assessment and payment. 
                  (1)  Development impact fees shall be assessed and paid no later than the issuance of a building permit, except: 
                  a.  When the applicant appeals the development impact fee assessment for any reason as set forth in this subsection. In such a case, the applicant shall pay 85 percent of the original assessment. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued until the appeal is resolved; or 
                  b.  When the development impact fee assessed for a single project is greater than $10,000.00, the applicant may make a request to the impact fee administrator or his designee to pay the fee in four equal payments at such times during the construction process as determined by the Coweta County Building Official or his designee. If the applicant qualifies for a four-part payment, the impact fee administrator or his designee shall determine the amounts to be paid and forward approval of the payments scheduled to the building department. If the fee is to be paid in four payments, one payment shall be made at the time of the issuance of the building permit and the remaining balance shall be paid not later than the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued until the development impact fee has been paid in full. 
                  (2)  Unless otherwise provided by state law, all development impact fees shall be collected no earlier than the time of issuance of a building permit, and no later than as a prerequisite to issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the building. 
                  (3)  For projects not involving issuance of a building permit, all development impact fees shall be collected at the time of approval of the development permit or such other authorization to commence construction or to commence use of a property. 
                  (4)  If the final use of a building cannot be determined at the time of the initial building permit, the administrator shall have the authority to assess a development impact fee based on the most likely use of the building, and shall adjust the fee in accordance with the actual use prior to issuance of any interior finishes permit or approval of a certificate of occupancy. An adjustment may result in a refund to the feepayer or payment of the increase of the adjusted fee over the amount already paid. 
                  a.  In the case of an industrial speculative building shell, at the feepayer's option, the impact fee category used for the initial building permit shall be the same as assessed for a "high-cube warehouse," and shall be adjusted in accordance with the actual use prior to issuance of an interior finishes permit for such use. 
                  b.  In the case of a multiple occupancy commercial building, such as a strip center or shopping center, at the feepayer's option the impact fee category used for the initial building permit shall be the same as assessed for a "furniture store," and shall be adjusted in accordance with the actual use prior to issuance of an interior finishes permit. 
                  c.  The impact fee assessed for an interior finishes permit for each actual use shall be based on the gross floor area of the actual use, and a credit for the impact fee payment for the initial building permit shall be prorated to the actual use as a percentage of the gross floor area of the entire building that the actual use will occupy. 
                  (5)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, any future change in demand for public facilities in excess of the average demand anticipated at the time of issuance of the building permit shall be assessed such additional fee as would otherwise have been due. Future changes in demand may result from a change in the land use category of the occupant of the building or property, the expansion of a building or use on a property that results in an increase in the units of developments (as defined herein), or the subsequent discovery of facts unknown or misrepresented at the time of issuance of the building permit. 
                  (c)  Individual assessment determinations. Individual assessments of development impact fees may be established as follows: 
                  (1)  At their option, an applicant for development approval may petition the administrator for an individual assessment determination of development impact fees due for their project in lieu of the fee established on the fee schedule attached hereto and incorporated herein as Exhibit 1. 
                  (2)  In the event that an applicant elects an individual assessment, the applicant shall submit an individual assessment study. Each individual assessment study shall: 
                  a.  Be based on relevant and credible information from an accepted standard source of engineering or planning data; or 
                  b.  Be based on actual, relevant, and credible studies or surveys of facility demand conducted in Coweta County or its region, carried out by qualified engineers or planners pursuant to accepted methodology; and 
                  c.  Provide any other written specifications as may be reasonably required by the administrator to substantiate the individual assessment determination. 
                  (3)  The administrator in his or her sole discretion shall determine whether the content of an individual assessment study satisfies the requirements of this article. A negative determination by the administrator may be appealed to the board of commissioners in accordance with the administrative appeals section of this article. 
                  (4)  Any fee approved as an individual assessment determination shall have standing for 180 days following the date of approval. Payment of such an approved individual assessment determination shall constitute full and complete payment of the project's proportionate share of system improvements as individually levied by Coweta County, and shall be deemed to be in compliance with the requirements of this article. 
                  (d)  Fee certification. Upon application to the administrator, a developer may receive a certification of the development impact fee schedule attached hereto and incorporated herein as Exhibit 1 or a certified fee for a particular project, as applicable. Such certified schedule or fee shall establish the development impact fee due for a period of 180 days from the date of certification, even if new or revised rate schedules are adopted in the interim.

                  (a)  The application for exemption approval must be made by the building permit applicant or owner to the county administrator or his designee. A building permit may be issued upon approval of an exemption, or may be issued without payment of applicable impact fees following receipt of a complete exemption application and pending its approval, but a certificate of occupancy shall not be issued until a decision regarding the exemption application is made, the exemption is otherwise withdrawn by the applicant, or payment of impact fees have been made. 
                  (b)  An affidavit and supporting documentation must be provided to the county administrator or his designee that demonstrates the applicant's eligibility for an exemption. The documentation shall address, but need not be limited to, all applicable exemption criteria adopted by the county. The documentation constitutes the application for exemption. 
                  (c)  The county administrator or his designee shall determine whether an application for exemption addresses the exemption criteria adopted by the county and is complete. A negative determination by the administrator or his designee may be appealed to the board of commissioners in accordance with section 50-82 of this article. 
                  (d)  The county administrator or his designee shall determine the eligibility for an exemption, in accordance with the standards and procedures contained in the exemption criteria adopted by the board of commissioners. If action by the board of commissioners is required, the application for exemption or appeal shall be considered no later than 30 days after the completed application is received. 
                  (5)  Other office, retail trade or other industrial uses. Any office, retail trade, or other industrial use that do not meet the criteria set forth in subsections (1), (2) or (3) may request a whole or partial exemption. The board of commissioners may grant a whole or partial exemption if the board of commissioners finds that the project provides extraordinary benefit in support of the economic advancement of the county's citizens over and above the access to jobs, goods and services that such uses offer in general. 
                  (6)  Reimbursement to impact fee fund. It is recognized that the cost of system improvements otherwise foregone through exemption of any impact fee must be funded through revenue sources other than impact fees.

                  a.  Impact fees collected to recover the present value of excess capacity in existing system improvements; 
                  b.  Any portion of an impact fee collected as a repayment for expenditures made by Coweta County for system improvements intended to be funded by such impact fee; and

                  (1)  The administrator shall prepare an annual report to the board of commissioners as part of the annual audit describing the amount of any development impact fees collected, encumbered, and used during the preceding fiscal year by category of public facility and service area. 
                  (2)  Such annual report shall be prepared following guidelines of the Georgia Department of Community Affairs (DCA), and submitted to DCA in conjunction with the annual update of the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan.

                  Sec. 50-78. - Credits. 
                  When eligible, feepayors shall be entitled to a credit against impact fees otherwise due and owing under the circumstances and in the manner set forth in this section. 
                  (a)  Credits; restrictions. 
                  (1)  Except as provided in paragraph (2) below, no credit shall be given for construction, contribution, or dedication of any system improvement or funds for system improvements made before the effective date of this article. 
                  (2)  If the value of any construction, dedication of land, or contribution of money made by a developer (or his or her predecessor in title or interest) prior to the effective date of this article for system improvements that are included for impact fee funding in the capital improvements element of the comprehensive land use plan, is greater than the impact fee that would otherwise have been paid for the project, then the developer shall be entitled to a credit for such excess construction, dedication, or funding. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this article, any credit due under this section shall not constitute a liability of Coweta County, and shall accrue to the developer to the extent of impact fees assessed for new development for the same category of system improvements within the same service area. 
                  (3)  In no event shall credit be given for project improvements, or for system improvements not included for impact fee funding in the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan. 
                  (b)  Granting of credits. 
                  (1)  Credit shall be given for the present value of any construction of improvements, contribution or dedication of land, or payment of money by a developer or his or her predecessor in title or interest for system improvements of the same public facilities category and in the same service area for which a development impact fee is imposed, provided that: 
                  a.  The system improvement is included for impact fee funding in the capital improvements element of the comprehensive land use plan; 
                  b.  The amount of the credit does not exceed the portion of the system improvement's cost that is eligible for impact fee funding, as shown in the capital improvements element; and 
                  c.  The board of commissioners shall have explicitly approved said improvement, contribution, dedication, or payment and the value thereof prior to its construction, dedication, or transfer. 
                  (2)  The credit allowed pursuant to this section shall not exceed the impact fee due for such system improvement unless a greater credit is authorized under a private agreement executed under the provisions of section 50-79 of this article. 
                  (c)  Guidelines for credit valuation. Credits under this section shall be valued using the following guidelines: 
                  (1)  For the construction of any system improvements by a developer or his or her predecessor in title or interest and accepted by the county, the developer must present evidence satisfactory to the administrator of the original cost of the improvement, from which present value may be calculated. 
                  (2)  For any contribution or dedication of land for system improvements by a developer or his or her predecessor in title or interest and accepted by the county, the original value of the land shall be the same as that attributed to the property by the validated tax appraisal at the time of dedication, from which present value may be calculated. 
                  (3)  For any contribution of capital equipment that qualifies as a system improvement by a developer or his or her predecessor in title or interest and accepted by the county, the value shall be the original cost to the developer of the capital equipment or the cost that Coweta County, Georgia, would normally pay for such equipment, whichever is less. 
                  (4)  For any contribution of money for system improvements from a developer or his or her predecessor in title or interest accepted by the county, the original value of the money shall be the same as that at the time of contribution, from which present value may be calculated. 
                  (5)  In making a present value calculation, the discount rate used shall be the net of the interest returned on a State of Georgia, AA rated or better municipal bond less average annual inflation, or such other discount rate as the board of commissioners in its sole discretion may deem appropriate. 
                  (d)  Credits; application. 
                  (1)  Credits shall be given only upon written request of the developer to the administrator. A developer must present written evidence satisfactory to the administrator at or before the time of development impact fee assessment. 
                  (2)  The administrator, in his or her sole discretion, shall review all claims for credits and make determinations regarding the allowance of any claimed credit, and the value of any allowed credit. 
                  (3)  Any credit approved by the administrator shall be acknowledged in writing by the administrator and calculated at the time of impact fee assessment. 
                  (e)  Credits; abandoned building permits. In the event that an impact fee is paid but the building permit is abandoned, credit shall be given for the present value of the impact fee against future impact fees for the same parcel of land, upon submission of adequate evidence to the administrator that an impact fee was received by the county, the amount paid, and that the building permit was abandoned.

                  (1)  Upon the request of a feepayor regarding a property on which a development impact fee has been paid, the development impact fee shall be refunded if: 
                  a.  Capacity is available in the public facilities for which the fee was collected but service is permanently denied; or 
                  b.  The development impact fee has not been encumbered or construction has not been commenced within six years after the date the fee was collected. 
                  (2)  In determining whether development impact fees have been encumbered, development impact fees shall be considered encumbered on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis. 
                  (b)  Notice of entitlement to a refund. When the right to a refund exists due to a failure to encumber the development impact fees, the administrator shall provide written notice of entitlement to a refund to the feepayor who paid the development impact fee at the address shown on the application for development approval or to a successor in interest who has given adequate notice to the administrator of a legal transfer or assignment of the right to entitlement to a refund and who has provided a mailing address. Such notice shall also be published in a newspaper of general circulation in Coweta County within 30 days after the expiration of the six-year period after the date that the development impact fee was collected and shall contain a heading "Notice of Entitlement to Development Impact Fee Refund". No refund shall be made for a period of 30 days from the date of said publication. 
                  (c)  Filing a request for a refund. All requests for refunds shall be made in writing to the administrator within one year of the time the refund becomes payable or within one year of publication of the notice of entitlement to a refund, whichever is later. Failure to make a claim for a refund within said time period shall result in a waiver of all claims to said funds. 
                  (d)  Payment of refunds. 
                  (1)  All refunds shall be made to the feepayor within 60 days after it is determined by the administrator that a sufficient proof of claim for refund has been made, but no sooner than 30 days after publication of the notice of entitlement to the refund. 
                  (2)  A refund shall include a refund of a pro rata share of interest actually earned on the unused or excess impact fee collected. 
                  (3)  In no event shall a feepayor be entitled to a refund for impact fees assessed and paid to recover the cost of excess capacity in existing system improvements, for any portion of an impact fee collected as a repayment for expenditures made by Coweta County for system improvements intended to be funded by such impact fee, or for that portion of the fee payment that was assessed for administration of the impact fee ordinance or for recovery of the cost of preparation of the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan.

                  (1)  Modify the estimates of impact on public facilities according to the methods and provisions concerning the calculation of impact fees, provided that any such agreement shall allow the county to assess additional development impact fees after the completion of construction according to schedules set forth in this article. 
                  (2)  Permit construction of, dedication of property for, or other in-kind contribution for specific public facilities of the type for which development impact fees would be imposed in the same service area in lieu of or with a credit against applicable development impact fees. 
                  (3)  Permit a schedule and method of payment appropriate to particular and unique circumstances of a proposed project in lieu of the requirements for payment under this article, provided that acceptable security is posted ensuring payment of the development impact fees. Forms of security that may be acceptable include a cash bond, irrevocable letter of credit from a bank authorized to do business within the State of Georgia, a surety bond, or lien or mortgage on lands to be covered by the building permit.

                  In furtherance of the Coweta County Impact Fee Ordinance adopted on April 4, 2006, and as such ordinance may be amended from time to time, the board of commissioners do hereby amend and readopt the following criteria to guide the granting of an exemption, in whole or in part, from the impact fees applicable to a particular development project in accordance with the exemption policy set forth under subsection 50-76(a) of said impact fee ordinance. 
                  (a)  Findings. The board of commissioners of Coweta County finds that certain nonprofit institutions foster and support extraordinary economic development and employment growth of public benefit to Coweta County through the provision of a stable and socially beneficent religious environment that will attract and support a highly qualified labor force, which in turn cultivates business development and expansion in the county. 
                  The board of commissioners of Coweta County finds that certain nonprofit, accredited educational institutions foster and support extraordinary economic development and employment growth of public benefit to Coweta County in an equal manner to public schools, and are instrumental in creating and attracting a highly qualified labor force in the county that will cultivate business development and expansion. 
                  The board of commissioners of Coweta County finds that certain office, retail trade or industrial uses that create unusually high investment, economic or job creation benefits represent extraordinary economic development and employment growth of public benefit to Coweta County in proportion to the creation of such benefits. 
                  (b)  Exemption criteria. 
                  (1)  Institutions: An institution shall be granted a 100 percent exemption by the impact fee program administrator from all applicable impact fees upon the determination that the new construction or expansion project meets all of the following criteria: 
                  a.  The institution that will own and occupy the new construction or expansion project is protected as a "religious institution" under the federal Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000, 42 U.S.C.A. §§ 2000cc to—5 (West Supp. 2001). 
                  b.  The institution that will own and occupy the new construction or expansion project has been recognized as tax-exempt by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service as an organization operated exclusively for religious purposes under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
                  c.  The new construction or expansion project is clearly designed to accommodate the institution's unique or individual occupancy and operational characteristics that are related to the religious exercise or assembly of the institution. 
                  (2)  Private schools: A private school shall be granted a 100 percent exemption by the impact fee program administrator from all applicable impact fees upon the determination that the new construction or expansion project meets all of the following criteria: 
                  a.  The corporation or other entity that will own and occupy the new construction or expansion project has adopted articles of organization (as defined by and acceptable to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service) that limits it exclusively to education purpose, and to the primary purpose of educating children or young adults on its premises, and its tax-exempt status has been recognized by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
                  b.  The new construction or expansion project is clearly designed to accommodate the private school's unique or individual occupancy and operational characteristics, such as classroom space, congregate dining facilities, student residence/dormitory facilities and/or sports/recreational activities. 
                  c.  The private school is an accredited school under rules of the State of Georgia, as follows: 
                  1.  For grades K—12, an accredited school shall mean one whose students are recognized and approved by the Georgia Department of Education for purposes of transferring credits to public schools on the same basis as students from one public school to another under Rule 160-5-1-.15 of the Department of Education, and/or whose graduates are recognized by the Georgia Board of Regents for college entrance to any institution of the University System of Georgia on the same basis as graduates from public schools. 
                  2.  For private collegiate institutions, an accredited school shall mean one that is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools on the same basis as a public college or university in Georgia. 
                  (3)  Businesses: 
                  a.  Prequalified industrial uses. An industrial use (as defined in the Coweta County Zoning Ordinance) shall be granted a 100 percent exemption by the impact fee program administrator from all applicable impact fees upon the determination that the industrial building or use meets all requirements of section 6.01 of the Coweta County Development Impact Fee Ordinance [section 50-75 of this article] and is located within a planned industrial park that was originally planned for at least 500 acres. 
                  b.  Office, retail trade or other industrial uses. A new construction or expansion project for an office, retail trade or nonqualified industrial use may be granted an exemption from applicable impact fees, in whole or in part, by the board of commissioners. The extent of the grant of exemption shall be based on the extent to which the development project represents extraordinary economic development and employment growth of public benefit to Coweta County, over and above the access to jobs, goods and services that such uses offer in general, considering the following factors, among others: 
                  1.  Use: Preference will be given to the construction or expansion of national or regional corporate office facilities and to construction or expansion projects related to industries primarily involved in research and development, assembly or manufacturing. 
                  2.  Investment: The total amount of new private capital investment in land, buildings and equipment related to the project; and the total capital investment in current facilities if the project expands an existing business in the county. 
                  3.  Annual economic impact: The total annual amount of new wages, purchases and other expenditures that will be generated as a result of the project; and the total annual economic impact of current facilities if the project expands an existing business in the county.

                  (i)  The total number of jobs created and/or retained as a result of the project. 
                  (ii)  The number of jobs created and/or retained paying at least 100 percent of the average wage for the county as established by the Georgia Department of Labor. 
                  (iii)  The number of jobs created or retained that are exempt managerial and/or professional and/or senior executive jobs. 
                  (c)  Reimbursement to impact fee fund.

As part of the annual budgeting process, adequate funds shall be identified and transferred to the impact fee fund accounts equal to the amount of all exemptions granted by the board of commissioners during the preceding year.

                  It shall be unlawful for any person to obstruct, encroach upon, or injure materially any part of any county road or county rights-of-way. For purposes of this section, the term "obstruct" shall include, without limitation, the causing of any buildup of rock, gravel, mud, dirt, chemicals, or other materials by continued ingress and egress of vehicles or of any natural waters dammed or redirected by diversion to an extent which presents a hazard to the traveling public.

Costs incurred for traffic management may include, but not be limited to, costs incurred for flagging, signing, or provision of detours, provided that these activities are directly caused by the obstruction, encroachment, or injury to the county road or right-of-way.

                  This chapter shall hereafter be known and cited as the "Coweta County Sign Ordinance." 
                  (Ord. No. 038-07, 11-15-07) 
                  Sec. 58-2. - Statement of findings. 
                  The county finds that signs provide an important medium through which individuals, businesses, and government may convey a variety of messages. Left unregulated, however, signs can become a threat to the public health and safety as a traffic hazard and a detriment to property values and the overall economic growth of Coweta County as an aesthetic nuisance. See, e.g., Scenic America, Billboards and Sign Control available at http://www.scenic.org; Jerry Weitz, Ph.D., AICP, The Public Purpose of Rowell's Sign Ordinance and the Implications of Doing Without It: A Position Paper (December 7, 1999) available at http://roswellgov.com; Street Graphics and the Law, 2004 Revised Edition, Daniel Mandelker, Andrew Bertucci, and William Ewald In particular, based on the cited materials and the studies referenced therein as well as other related studies included in the county's file, the county finds that unregulated signs: 
                  (a)  Can be a safety hazard to drivers and pedestrians; 
                  (b)  Can create unsafe, cluttered and aesthetically blighted thoroughfares throughout the county; 
                  (c)  Can hamper economic growth; 
                  (d)  Can lower property values; 
                  (e)  Can adversely impact public investments; 
                  (f)  Can degrade the utility of public safety signs; and 
                  (g)  Can adversely impact the aesthetic quality of the community and surrounding environment. 
                  The county also finds the following: 
                  (a)  There is a substantial difference between signs erected by public authority and signs erected by private citizens or businesses. Signs erected by public authority are virtually all erected for the purpose of maintaining the public safety either through direct control of traffic or through provision of such type signage as street signs which enable the traveling public to know where they are located and to find where they are going. As such, with the exception of signs identifying government buildings, virtually all government signs are erected purely for public safety purposes. Moreover, their use in the public right-of-way is necessary to ensure their visibility to the motoring public. The county finds that public utility signs are frequently of the same nature as those signs erected by governmental entities in that they provide necessary information to safeguard the public from downed power lines and from street excavations. Even where signs serve a propriety purpose, such as identifying markings on utility polls, those signs are marked primarily for the purpose of benefiting the public generally through identification of locations where there may be temporary losses of power. 
                  (b)  Some signage has a single targeted function and identification of such signage by description is impossible without referring to its function. For instance, address numerals are used for the sole purpose of locating addresses, which is of benefit to persons looking for those addresses and is essential to public safety personnel responding to emergencies. While such signage is referenced based upon the function it serves within the context of this chapter, the provisions of this chapter are unrelated to the content of the speech provided and allow maximum expressive potential to sign owners.

                  Sec. 58-3. - Statement of purpose. 
                  By enacting this chapter, the county intends: 
                  (a)  To balance the rights of individuals, businesses, and government to convey their messages through signs and the right of the public to be protected against the unrestricted proliferation of signs; 
                  (b)  To afford the business community equal and fair opportunity to advertise and promote its products and services without discrimination; 
                  (c)  To preserve and promote the public health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of Coweta County; 
                  (d)  To improve traffic and pedestrian safety; 
                  (e)  To maintain and enhance the visual environment, and preserve the right of citizens and visitors to enjoy Coweta County's scenic beauty; 
                  (f)  To protect property values of nearby public and private property by minimizing possible adverse effects and visual blight caused by signs; 
                  (g)  To avoid the harmful aspects of the unrestricted proliferation of signs; 
                  (h)  To promote economic development;

                  (1)  Nonresidential districts. No sign shall be illuminated by lights that flash, move, change in intensity, or turn on intermittently more than once per day, except as provided herein. To prevent glare visible from a public street or adjoining property, the beam of any light shall be directed so as not to be visible beyond the sign at which it is directed, and the light source shall not be visible from any point on an adjacent property or the public right-of-way. Light from any illuminated sign shall not be of an intensity or brightness which will interfere with the peace, comfort, convenience, and general welfare of residents or occupants of adjacent properties or vehicular traffic on adjacent roadways. 
                  (2)  Residential districts. Signs located in residential districts shall not be illuminated other than signs at the entrance of the subdivision.

                  (a)  Findings and purpose. Many people travel to, from and through the county on a daily basis. During the weekday rush hours when the majority of people on the roads are commuting to or from work, roads are often nearly beyond their capacity. Traffic hazards and distractions must be minimized. People at times, however, need the benefit of signs to help them find their destinations. Properly regulated, such signs may actually aid the flow of traffic. The following regulations recognize the difference in weekday and weekend traffic and are intended to promote and protect the health, safety and welfare of the residents, visitors and businesses of the county. 
                  (b)  Definition. "Weekend signs" are signs erected between the hours of noon on Friday until midnight on Sunday. 
                  (c)  [Where allowed.] A general permit is hereby granted for the weekend signs in any zoning district. 
                  (d)  [Regulations.] Weekend signs are subject to the following regulations: 
                  (1)  No more than one weekend sign per lot, per road frontage. 
                  (2)  Weekend signs must be at least 50 feet apart. 
                  (3)  Weekend signs shall not exceed six square feet of sign area and three feet in height and may be double-faced. 
                  (4)  Weekend signs shall be at least 15 feet from the edge of the pavement or outside of the right-of-way, whichever is greater; and shall be at least ten feet from side and rear property lines. Determination of the right-of-way can be made by contacting the public works department. 
                  (5)  All weekend signs must be placed on private property and may not be placed upon the right-of-way. 
                  (6)  Sign owner shall have written permission from the property owner authorizing the display of the weekend sign and shall produce the written permission at the request of a county agent. 
                  (7)  Each weekend sign shall be legibly marked with the name of the owner. If a party other than the owner agrees to be responsible for the removal of the sign, then the responsible party's name may be substituted. This information must be written in weatherproof ink or paint upon at least one face of the weekend sign and in letters of at least one inch in height. The weekend sign is subject to being removed if it is not marked with the name specified herein. 
                  (8)  Weekend signs shall not be affixed in any manner to trees, natural objects, streetlight poles, utility poles, other signs or other sign structures. 
                  (e)  [Removal.] It shall be the responsibility of the sign owner to remove all weekend signs prior to midnight Sunday. 
                  (f)  Enforcement. In addition to the penalties set forth in section 58-15 of this chapter, the owner of the weekend sign or the owner of the product being advertised on the weekend sign, if that is the purpose of the sign, may be fined $1,000.00 for each sign displayed after midnight on Sunday.

                  (4)  These signs are not limited in design to monument signs. 
                  (5)  These signs are limited to a display of noncommercial speech or commercial speech that pertains to a commercial enterprise located on the property, such as a for sale sign, a sign reflecting the property's home occupation, or a yard sale sign. 
                  In the event that a court should adjudge any part of this section of the ordinance a violation of the Georgia or United States Constitutions or any other provision of law, it is the specific intent of the Coweta County Board of Commissioners that this provision referencing a limitation to noncommercial speech or commercial speech that pertains to a commercial enterprise located on the property be omitted from the ordinance and the remainder of the ordinance stay in effect to regulate signs on property within the County. This severance section is in addition to the legislative intent expressed in section 58-15 of this chapter. 
                  (e)  Window signs.

                  (1)  Approval. If the planning department finds that the application complies with the standards of this chapter, the planning department will forward the application to the building department for issuance of the sign permit. Sign application for which no action has been taken after 21 working days after the application is complete shall be deemed approved. 
                  (2)  Fails to comply.

No refunds will be made for permit fees paid for permits that expired due to failure to erect a permitted sign. If later an individual desires to erect a sign at the same location, a new application must be submitted and another fee paid in accordance with the fee schedule applicable at such time. 
                  (g)  Amendments. A sign permit may be amended, extended, or modified only in accordance with the procedures established for its original approval.

                  (i)  Identification labels. With each permit the county shall issue a sticker bearing the same number as the permit with which it is issued. It shall be the duty of the permittee or his agent to affix such sticker to the sign in the lower right hand area so it will be easily seen. The absence of a proper sticker shall be prima facie evidence that the sign has been, or is being, erected or operated in violation of the provisions of this chapter. Stickers may be color-coded. 
                  (j)  Assignment of sign permits. A current or valid sign permit shall be freely assigned or transferred to a successor as owner or lessee of the property or holder of a business license for the same premises, subject only to filing such application as the county may require and paying any applicable fees.

                  (b)  Nonconforming Signs. A nonconforming sign that is permanently affixed to the ground or to a building may continue to be used, except that the nonconforming sign: 
                  (1)  Shall not be enlarged or altered except in conformance with this chapter, but it may be repaired to the extent necessary to maintain it in a safe condition; 
                  (2)  Shall not be replaced, expanded or modified by another nonconforming sign, except that the substitution or interchange of poster panels, painted boards or dismountable material on nonconforming signs shall be permitted; 
                  (3)  Shall not be allowed to be increased in height or size or relocated on the property, but may be decreased in height or size;

                  a.  It has deteriorated to a point of making it a hazard, or unsightly; or 
                  b.  The sign has been damaged to such extent that more than minor repairs are required to restore the sign; 
                  (5)  Shall be removed if the use of the nonconforming sign, or the property on which it is located, has ceased, become vacant, or been unoccupied for a period of 180 consecutive days or more. An intent to abandon is not required as the basis for removal under this subsection; or 
                  (6)  Shall be removed if there is a change in use of the premises on which the nonconforming sign is located. 
                  (7)  To the extent this section conflicts with O.C.G.A. § 32-6-83 or Ga. Const. Art. 3 §6, ¶ 4(a) in application, this section shall be deemed to provide affected parties the minimum protections provided by O.C.G.A. § 32-6-83 or Ga. Const.

                  Sec. 58-14. - Variance. 
                  When a literal application of this chapter, due to special circumstances, would result in an unusual and extraordinary hardship in an individual case, a variance may be granted by the board of commissioners. 
                  (a)  Authority to grant variances. The board of commissioners is authorized to receive, consider, grant, grant with conditions, or deny applications for variances, provided, however, that with respect to height and size of a sign, the board of commissioners is only authorized to increase the height or size of a sign by a maximum of 25 percent of the standards set forth in this sign ordinance. 
                  (b)  Variance application. A request for a variance may be initiated by a property owner or his/her authorized agent by filing an application with the planning department. The application shall be accompanied by a site plan, drawn to scale, showing the dimensions and position of the proposed sign in relationship to the surrounding properties. The planning department may require other drawings or materials essential to an understanding of the proposed sign and variance requested and its relationship to the surrounding properties. The planning department is entitled to reject any variance application that does not include the information requested herein or that requests a variance to increase the size or height of the sign, except as provided elsewhere in this chapter. 
                  (c)  Fee. Each application for a variance shall be accompanied by the applicable fee, which shall be established by the county. 
                  (d)  Conditions and criteria for granting variances. The board of commissioners, in cases where specifically authorized, may grant a variance only after consideration and adoption of findings of fact that all of the following conditions and criteria have been met: 
                  (1)  There exist extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the property in question resulting from its size, shape, or topography that are not applicable to other lands or structures in the area; 
                  (2)  A literal interpretation of the provisions of the sign ordinance would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other similar properties; 
                  (3)  Granting a variance requested would not confer upon the property of the applicant any significant privileges that are denied to other similar properties; 
                  (4)  The requested variance will be in harmony with the purpose and intent of these regulations and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or to the general welfare; 
                  (5)  The special circumstances are not the result of actions of the applicant; 
                  (6)  The mere existence of a nonconforming sign or advertising device shall not constitute a valid reason to grant a variance; 
                  (7)  Granting the variance would not result in allowing a sign that interferes with road or highway visibility or obstruct or otherwise interfere with the safe and orderly movement of traffic; and 
                  (8)  The variance requested is the minimum variance, which will make possible the logical use of the land and sign. 
                  (e)  Appeals. Any party aggrieved or affected by the decision of the board of commissioners may appeal the decision by filing a writ of certiorari with the superior court pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1, et seq. 
                  (Ord. No. 038-07, 11-15-07; Ord. No. 026-08, 8-19-08; Ord. No. 004-13, § 3, 2-19-13)

                  (b)  Penalties. A violation of this chapter shall result in the sign permit being revoked. Additionally, any person violating this chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction, shall be punished as provided in section 1-15 of the Coweta County Code of Ordinances. If found guilty, a person violating this chapter may be fined up to $1,000.00 for each violation. 
                  (c)  Public nuisance. Any violation of this chapter is hereby declared to be a public nuisance. 
                  (d)  Notice. Code enforcement shall give the sign permittee ten to 30 days' written notice, based on the practical considerations of completing measures to comport with the standards of this chapter, to correct the deficiencies or to remove the sign(s) which is in violation of this chapter. If the permittee refuses to correct the deficiencies or remove the sign, the county may have the sign removed at the expense of the permittee. 
                  (e)  Removal. 
                  (1)  The county may order the removal of any sign in violation of this chapter by written notice to the permit holder; or if there is no permit holder, then to the owner of the sign; or if the sign owner cannot be found or cannot be determined, then to the sign erector and any party that procured the erection of the sign. If a permit has been issued, such notice shall operate to revoke the permit. 
                  (2)  If the sign is not removed within the time required by the county (or the date any appeal becomes final), the county shall remove or cause to be removed the sign and collect the costs thereof. 
                  (3)  The county shall have removed any sign in violation of this chapter, without giving notice to any party if: the sign is upon the public right-of-way or upon other public property or if the sign poses an immediate safety threat to the life or health of any member of the public. 
                  (4)  Signs removed by the county will be destroyed after 14 days if they are not claimed. 
                  (f)  Appeal. Any violator may appeal the determination of code enforcement to the board of commissioners in accordance with the procedures of subsection 58-12(l) of this chapter except an appeal must be filed within the time allowed by code enforcement for action on the part of the permit holder, sign owner, or sign erector. Any appeal shall act as a supersedeas of the county's enforcement of this chapter, except to the extent that violation of this chapter is deemed to present a safety hazard to the public. 
                  (g)  Legal proceedings. The county, upon a finding that any provision of this chapter is being violated, is authorized to institute legal proceedings to enjoin violations of this chapter. The violator shall be liable for court costs and reasonable attorney fees incurred by the county. 
                  (Ord. No. 038-07, 11-15-07) 
                  Sec. 58-16. - Severability and conflict. 
                  (a)  Severability. This chapter is declared to be severable. In the event any section, subsection, sentence, clause or phrase of this chapter shall be declared or adjudged invalid or unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, such adjudication shall in no manner affect the other sections, subsections, sentences, clauses or phrases of this chapter, which shall remain of full force and effect, as if the section, subsection, sentence, clause or phrase so declared or adjudged invalid or unconstitutional were not originally a part hereof. The county hereby declares that it would have passed the remaining parts of this chapter if it had known that such part or parts hereof would be declared or adjudged invalid or unconstitutional. 
                  (b)  Conflict. If any part of this chapter is found to be in conflict with any other ordinance of this county or any state or federal statute, the most restrictive or highest standard shall prevail. If any part of this sign ordinance is explicitly prohibited by state or federal statute, that part shall not be enforced.

                  (a)  The developer must fund all improvements necessary for the water service to the specific project. This includes all project water main and service line in compliance with the water and sewer department's development standards for water and sewer system expansions. This also includes the cost necessary to run water mains on county or state roadway rights-of-way where the county does not have current water service. This cost is only the cost necessary to serve the development water service in accordance with Rules for Safe Drinking Water for the State of Georgia, and fire protection as required by development standards and minimum fire flows and pressures. 
                  (b)  The water department's engineer will determine compliance with the listed requirements, and approve all plans. 
                  (c)  Should the county wish to up-size water mains on county or state road rights-of-way that a development is placing to serve its specific project need, then the county will on a case-by-case basis analyze the situation to determine need, size, and compatibility with the county's overall distribution system. Then should the board of commissioners wish to up size the main, the county will bear all cost above what is necessary to serve the specific project improvement. The board of commissioners may, however, refuse to allow any line to be placed on county rights-of-way if it is their determination that it is in the best interest of the overall county water system to do so. 
                  (d)  The county realizes that if it does not support the water main up-sizing and allows the line to be placed at the lower size, then the water main placed on state or county road rights-of-way cannot be used by the county for any purpose other than the conveyance of water to the specific project. 
                  (e)  All cost associated with joint participation, should the board of commissioners select to participate, will be estimated by the department's engineer or designate after plans have been approved by the county and state EPD drinking water division. The actual cost will be on a unit price basis either by an individual project bidding procedure or as a change order to current water main extension contract. All joint projects will be administered by the county water and sewer department or designate. For joint projects, the developer will be required to supply a bank letter of credit or account in escrow for the estimated cost of the water main necessary to serve the specific project prior to bids or executed change orders.

                  ARTICLE VI. - BACKFLOW PREVENTION BY CONTAINMENT[2] 

                  Footnotes: 
                  --- (2) --- 
                  Editor's note— The Backflow Prevention by Containment ordinance herein set out was originally adopted by motion on January 1, 1991, and was revised September 1, 1998. This article is a representation of the Backflow Prevention by Containment ordinance as it appears in a document dated October, 2005. 

                  Sec. 78-91. - Intent, purpose and control. 
                  (1)  Intent. To recognize that all consumer's water systems have connections to apparatus, vessels, etc., that could have impurities in varying degrees, and if not properly controlled and contained, could contaminate or pollute both the consumer's water system and the public potable water supply/system. It is also the intent to apply the principle that the type of protection required shall be that determined by whether the impurities are hazardous contaminants or nonhazardous pollutants. 
                  (2)  Purpose. 
                  a.  To assist the consumer in protecting his own potable water system against actual or potential backflow and/or backsiphonage of any contaminant or pollutant by controlling each cross-connection or potential cross-connection within the consumer's premises. Referred to as "The First Line of Defense" or "Primary Protection". 
                  b.  To protect the Coweta County public potable water supply/system against actual or potential backflow by containing within a consumer's premises, any pollution or contamination that has entered, or may enter, into the consumer's potable water system through an undiscovered or uncontrolled cross-connection on said premises. Referred to as "The Second Line of Defense" or "Secondary Protection". 
                  c.  To eliminate uncontrolled cross-connections to non-potable systems as well as uncontrolled interconnections to any potable water system that is not a part of the Coweta County Water System, by installing an appropriate backflow prevention device(s) to isolate such system(s) from that of the Coweta County Water System. 
                  d.  To establish, coordinate, execute and maintain a total backflow prevention program. 
                  (3)  Control. Requires cooperation between Coweta County Water and Sewer Department, Plumbing Inspection Department and it's water consumers in the execution of, and the adherence to the duties and responsibilities of each as set forth by this program, in conjunction with other applicable codes, rules and regulations. 
                  Sec. 78-92. - Responsibilities. 
                  (1)  Water and sewer department (purveyor). The superintendent of the Coweta County Water and Sewer Department, as authorized through ordinances adopted by the Coweta County Board of Commissioners, is primarily responsible for preventing the contamination and pollution of the public potable water supply/system by instituting a program of backflow prevention by containment. Such responsibility begins at the point of origin of the public potable water supply and includes all the distribution system and terminates at the service connection for the consumer's water system. The required consumer supplied backflow prevention device at the service connection shall provide maximum (reduced pressure zone assembly - RPZ) or minimum (double check valve assembly - DCV) protection as concluded by the superintendent or his authorized representative. In addition, the superintendent shall exercise reasonable vigilance to ensure that the consumer adheres to this article and these procedures as stated and outlined herein. In order for the department to downgrade from maximum protection at a service connection a certification of plumbing code compliance (as pertaining to backflow prevention) plus annual recertification shall be required. 
                  (2)  The plumbing inspection department. The plumbing inspection department is primarily responsible for enforcing the plumbing code to prevent contamination and pollution within the consumer's water system through a program of "Backflow Prevention By Cross Connection Control," requiring that all plumbing outlets terminate through an approved air gap or be controlled by an approved mechanical backflow prevention device. Such responsibility begins at the service connection to the premises and extends to the extremities of the consumer's potable water system. 
                  (3)  The consumer (customer). The consumer has the responsibility for protecting both the potable water in his own system from degradation due to conditions originating on his premises, by complying with the plumbing code, and also for protecting the quality of water in the Coweta County Water System against any potential or actual health hazards generated on or from his premises through uncontrolled cross-connections by backflow prevention at the service connection. Therefore, after the water department has determined the type of backflow protection that is required at a consumer's service connection, the customer is then responsible for the costs of procurement, installation, testing, repair and maintenance of said device. 
                  (4)  The certified backflow prevention assembly tester. The tester shall be responsible for performing accurate field tests on backflow prevention assemblies and making reports of these tests to the consumer and the Coweta County Water and Sewer Department on approved test report forms. The tester shall be able to identify and describe the basic hydraulic principles related to backflow prevention. The tester shall be able to show knowledge of product performance, product installation, product testing, documenting and recording of inspections and tests and be responsible for the accuracy of all tests and reports. 
                  (5)  The contractor (plumbing, mechanical, lawn irrigation, fire sprinkler). The contractor shall be familiar with this article and install the appropriate backflow prevention assembly correctly and in a safe working environment for testing and maintenance. The contractor shall be responsible of the initial testing of a backflow prevention assembly and provide notification to the Coweta County Water and Sewer Department prior to any installation. The contractor shall submit the test report forms to the Coweta County Water and Sewer Department in a timely manner. 
                  (Ord. of 11-15-05) 
                  Sec. 78-93. - Implementation and enforcement. 
                  (1)  This program shall be implemented immediately for Backflow Prevention by Containment; in conjunction with the existing Georgia State Plumbing Codes for Backflow Prevention by Cross-Connection Control on all new domestic water, process water, fire protection and irrigation system installations. 
                  (2)  Implementation of this program shall also commence immediately on existing installations. Priority schedules shall be established and evaluations made by the Coweta County Water and Sewer Department for the consumer's retrofit requirement at the service-connection, beginning with those consumers whose premises represent the greatest potential threat to the public potable water supply/system. The Coweta County Water and Sewer Department, however, shall not be responsible for abatement of cross-connections which may exist within a consumer's premises. As a minimum, the evaluation shall consider: the existence of cross-connections; the nature of the materials handled on the property; the probability of a backflow occurring; the degree of piping system complexity; and, the potential for system modification. 
                  (3)  Certificate of plumbing code compliance (as pertaining to backflow prevention); must be provided by the customer/owner in order to downgrade from maximum RPZ protection at the service connection. The Coweta County Chief Building Inspector must conduct a compliance inspection report on the total premises to insure that proper backflow prevention is in place as required by the Coweta County Plumbing Code. The minimum allowable protection at the service connection shall be contingent upon the following annual requirements: 
                  a.  The Coweta County Chief Building Inspector will complete a compliance inspection report on any plumbing changes made to assure that the total premises has achieved proper backflow protection as required by the Coweta County Plumbing Code. 
                  b.  A current device test report has been furnished at the time of inspection for each existing backflow preventer. 
                  c.  Backflow prevention devices that were not in place at the time of compliance inspection have been installed and device test reports submitted by the customer/owner. 
                  d.  Submit certificate of compliance and device test reports annually to the coweta county water department backflow prevention section. 
                  (4)  Request for variance; from the requirements to install an approved double detector check (DDC) backflow preventer on a fire service-connection, designated for fire protection use only, may be granted for an existing service connection only, and is contingent upon the following: 
                  a.  The service connection has an existing operable single detector check valve, and system has less than 1,000 feet of yard piping with two or less fire hydrants. 
                  b.  All intervening connections serving pumps, hose cabinets, standpipe and/or sprinkler systems are protected by an approved backflow preventer as required by the type hazard(s) involved. 
                  c.  Device test reports must be submitted annually to the Coweta County Water Department, backflow-prevention section for backflow-prevention device(s) existing and for any future addition(s). 
                  (5)  Enforcement of this program shall be administered by the Coweta County Water and Sewer Department, utilizing its staff in cooperation with those of the plumbing inspection, environmental health, and fire departments of Coweta County as authorized by the Coweta County Board of Commissioners. 
                  (6)  Penalties. Any person violating any provision of this article shall be liable for a penalty of not more than $1,000.00 per day, by sentence of imprisonment not exceeding 60 days in jail or both fine and jail. Any person found in violation of these provisions shall also pay all costs and expenses involved in the case over and above any fine imposed. Each day shall constitute a separate offense. 
                  Sec. 78-94. - Inspection of facilities. 
                  (1)  The consumer, upon request, shall furnish to the Coweta County Water and Sewer Department, any pertinent information regarding the consumer's water system on such premises where backflow and/or back-siphonage are deemed possible through uncontrolled plumbing connections and/or cross-connections. 
                  (2)  Nothing herein shall relieve the consumer of the responsibility for conducting or causing to be conducted periodic surveys of water-use practices on his premises to determine whether there are actual or potential uncontrolled cross-connections within the consumer's water system through which contaminants or pollutants could flow back into his own or Coweta County's Public Potable Water Supply/System. If the premises is classified restricted or high security with no admittance, maximum (RPZ) protection at the service-connection is required. 
                  (3)  Facilities considered to pose an actual or potential contamination and/or pollution threat to the water system's public potable water supply/system will be subject to inspection by an authorized representative(s) of the Coweta County Water and Sewer Department and, when deemed necessary, in accompaniment with a representative(s) from the plumbing inspection, health, and/or fire departments. Inspections will focus on plumbing outlets and potential contaminating or polluting substances within a facility. Inspections will be scheduled at a time mutually agreeable with the consumer's representative and the Coweta County Representative(s). Using information gathered, the water system's representative will determine the degree of potential backflow hazard and specify the type of backflow protection required at the consumer's service-connection. 
                  (4)  If, upon inspection, a facility is found not to be in full compliance with the plumbing code, maximum protection will be required. If the owner brings the facility up to full code compliance within a 90-day period, minimum protection will be allowed at the service-connection provided potential hazards within the premises are low. 
                  (5)  While in the course of a routine inspection or special investigation, the inspector(s) discovers a condition of imminent or actual high hazard system contamination, the Coweta County Water and Sewer Department will immediately discontinue service to the facility. Service will not be restored until the hazardous condition has been corrected and reinspected. 
                  (6)  In the event of accidental contamination or pollution of the public potable water supply/system, the consumer, if he is so aware, shall immediately notify the Coweta County Water and Sewer Department so that appropriate measures may be taken to contain and isolate the contaminant or pollutant. 
                  (7)  After reasonable notice to the consumer, of a violation of this article existing on the premises, water service may be discontinued, and any other such precautionary measures taken that are deemed necessary to protect the quality of the water in the Coweta County Water System. Water service shall not be restored until the danger has been eliminated in compliance with the provisions of this procedure. 
                  Sec. 78-95. - Water from other sources and fire hydrants. 
                  (1)  When any premises is served by the Coweta County Water and Sewer Department, and the owner of said premises continues to have a well or any other source of water, it shall be in violation of these procedures for the plumbing on said premises to be installed or so interconnected that water in the Coweta County Water and Sewer Department and the private water supply can, in any way, become intermingled. 
                  (2)  Upon discovery of an uncontrolled interconnection on any premises being furnished water through the county water system, as in item (1) above, the owner of said premises shall be notified that the interconnection must be removed or controlled by a backflow-prevention device within 30 days, and that failure to remove or correct the interconnection will result in removal of the meter. If the correction is not made within the 30-day period, the meter will be removed and will not be reinstalled until the maximum-type backflow protection is installed at the service-connection, and the owner has paid for all associated costs. 
                  (3)  Booster pumps installed on the service line to or within any premises, must be approved and permitted by the Coweta County Water and Sewer Department, and such permitted pumps shall be equipped with a low-pressure cut-off device designed to shut off the booster pump when the pressure in the service line on the suction side of the pump drops to 20 PSI or below. It shall be the duty of the water consumer to maintain their low-pressure cut-off device in proper working order at all times and to certify to the Coweta County Water and Sewer Department, at least once a year, that the device is operable. 
                  NOTE: Consumer shall assume all liabilities. 
                  (4)  Tanks, tanker trucks, seed spraying trucks, and other containers that will be filled with water obtained under the "fire hydrant water use permit" policy must be inspected, approved, and permitted by the county water and sewer department for the permanent installation of an approved air gap or reduced pressure zone backflow-prevention device prior to issuance of the fire hydrant water use permit. In addition, connecting hoses, etc., to a fire hydrant for purposes other than filling an approved tank or tank truck shall also include, as a minimum, a prior approved and inspected double check valve backflow preventer. 
                  Sec. 78-96. - Selection of devices. 
                  (1)  Vacuum breakers and backflow preventers shall be selected on basis of the impurities involved and the type cross-connection. The impurities shall be classified as contaminants (hazardous) and pollutants (non-hazardous): the type cross-connection by whether it is non-pressure or pressure as follows: (See Terminology: Appendix B). 
                  (a)  Cross-connection, non-pressure type. This type of connection, when not protected by a minimum air gap, shall be protected by an appropriate vacuum breaker or an appropriate backflow preventer (BFP). 
                  (b)  Cross-connection pressure type. This type connection shall be protected by an appropriate BFP only. 
                  CAUTION: A pressure vacuum breaker shall not be used alone on a pressure-type cross-connection. 
                  NOTE: Because an irrigation system serves an environment that is open to atmosphere, it would not be classified as a pressure-type cross-connection. However, due to the special nature of the installation, minimum protection against backflow shall include a double check valve backflow preventer. If chemicals are injected into the system, minimum protection shall include a reduced pressure zone backflow preventer. Section 1105.7, Georgia State Plumbing Code. 
                  As of the effective date of this article, any lawn irrigation shall require a separate tap, meter and backflow preventer purchased from and installed by the Coweta County Water and Sewer Department. No more domestic/lawn irrigation combination systems shall be allowed. Any combination lawn irrigation systems installed after this date shall be considered a penalty and subject to provisions as set forth in section 78-93 of this chapter. 
                  (2)  Vacuum breakers shall be corrosion resistant. Other backflow-prevention devices, including accessories, components, and fittings in sizes two inches and smaller shall be bronze with threaded connections. Sizes 2½ inches and larger shall be bronze, or fused epoxy-coated iron inside and out, or galvanized iron, with flanged connections. 
                  (3)  Each device shall have a brass identification tag, securely attached with corrosion-resistant mechanical fasteners, and include the manufacturer's name, serial number, and maximum working pressure and temperature.

                  (2)  Installation of all backflow-prevention devices shall be in accordance with the Georgia State Plumbing Code, the following procedures, and other applicable codes and regulations. Installations for containment shall be by a duly licensed plumbing, mechanical, and/or utility contractor; and as approved by the Coweta County Water and Sewer Department: 
                  (a)  When a dual or double check valve backflow preventer is used in the containment concept, it shall be installed at or as close to the service-connection as practical, in an approved meter box or covered vault. 
                  (b)  When a reduced pressure zone backflow preventer is installed at the service-connection it shall be above ground in a structure that is protected from freezing. In lieu of the above-ground installation at the service-connection, and at the owner's request, the water purveyor and the plumbing official may allow the RPZ to be installed immediately inside the building, in which case the device would remain under the jurisdiction of the Coweta County Water and Sewer Department and subject to inspections, and testing by its authorized representative. 
                  NOTE: When a backflow preventer is installed in a service pipe inside a structure on any premises for the purpose of containing said premises, it shall be unlawful to tap into such service pipe between the BFP and the service-connection. Any branch connection(s) on an existing service pipe shall be permanently disconnected or equipped with a backflow preventer(s) commensurate with the degree(s) of hazard. Section 1105.2(c), Georgia State Plumbing Code. 
                  (3)  Facilities that must have continuous uninterrupted water supply shall install backflow-prevention devices in parallel for testing and maintenance purposes. In no case shall a bypass arrangement be installed or maintained unless also equipped with an approved backflow-prevention device. 
                  (4)  Vacuum breakers and backflow preventers equipped with atmospheric vents, or with relief openings, shall be so installed and so located as to prevent any vent or any relief opening from being submerged. They shall be installed in the position as recommended by the manufacturer, and as prescribed in the following: 
                  (a)  Vacuum breaker, atmospheric type (AVB). This device shall be at least six inches above the highest outlet or the overflow level on the nonpotable system. It shall be installed downstream of the last shut-off valve. 
                  (b)  Vacuum breaker, pressure type (PVB). This device shall be installed at least 12 inches above the highest outlet or the overflow level on the nonpotable system. It may be installed upstream of the last shut-off valve. 
                  (c)  Vacuum breaker, hose type (HVB). This device shall be installed directly on the hose threads, if not an integral part of the valve. It may not be subjected to continuous pressure, static or flowing. Nor shall it be attached to a freezeless-type hydrant unless it is a model specifically designed for the service. 
                  (d)  Backflow preventer, dual check (DuC). This assembly shall not be buried in earth, but maybe installed below grade as in a meter box. A positive shut-off valve and union shall be near the inlet and outlet sides. 
                  (e)  Backflow preventer, double check valve (DCV). This device shall not be buried in earth but may be installed below ground in a pit provided ball valve test cocks fitted with brass plugs are used. Assembly bolts on bronze DCV's installed in pits shall be resistant to electrolysis. A full-port resilient-seated ball valve in sizes through two inches, in sizes above two inches, shall be near the inlet and outlet sides of the device. The device shall be provided with three ball valve test cocks and a fourth test cock shall be provided on the upstream side of the inlet shut-off valve. When below ground, a union or flange shall be near the inlet and outlet sides. No intervening connection(s) shall be between the shut-off valves and the backflow preventer. Except when a meter or other device with bronze strainer, integral or attached, is immediately upstream of the backflow preventer, a bronze strainer shall be provided between the inlet shut-off valve and the device on sizes through two inches. When used on sizes larger than two inches, the strainer shall be of the same material as the device. 
                  (f)  Backflow preventer with intermediate atmospheric vent (IAV). This device shall not be installed below ground. Where relief valve discharge could cause water damage, it shall be piped via an air gap, or a funnel, at the vent/relief port to a floor drain or other approved location. A positive shut-off valve and union shall be near the inlet and outlet sides of the device. Strainer to be included as in paragraph (d) above. 
                  (g)  Backflow preventer, reduced pressure zone (RPZ). This device shall not be installed below ground. Where relief valve discharge could cause water damage, it shall be piped via an air gap, or a funnel, at the vent/relief port to a floor drain or other approved location. Positive shut-off valves, test cocks, and strainer are to be provided as in paragraph (e) above. No intervening branch connection(s) shall be between the shut-offs and the backflow preventer. 
                  NOTE: When a reduced pressure zone device is installed in a line subject to periodic no-flow conditions, and supply pressure subject to fluctuations, an auxiliary directional check with soft disc, capable of functioning in any position with the BFP may be installed, it shall be provided between the inlet shut-off valve and the BFP head to lock the supply pressure in, and prevent unnecessary discharge through the vent/relief port. Make-up lines to chilled water systems and hydronic heating systems are examples of installations where a drop in supply pressure may occur during no-flow conditions. When a water pressure reducing valve is required in the same line with the RPZ device, it is usually possible to locate the reducing valve upstream of the device and take advantage of the check valve effect of the reducing valve. In such case, the auxiliary directional check would not be required. 
                  SPECIAL CAUTION: 
                  THERMAL EXPANSION. When water is heated and stored in a distribution system or a branch of the system that has been closed by the installation of a backflow-prevention device or any other checking device, an approved auxiliary relief valve, or expansion chamber shall be installed to limit thermal expansion of the water being heated to not more than 80 psi no-flow pressure at any fixture on the system. Section 1112.8 of the Georgia State Plumbing Code.

                  APPENDIX A. - CROSS-CONNECTION EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN 
                  All customer inquiries concerning water quality are directed to the department of water distribution. When a complaint is received, it is evaluated over the phone with the customer. If the complaint is determined to be a potential problem, a member of the department of water distribution is dispatched to the area reporting the problem. On arrival in the problem area, the technician will: 
                  (A)  Make a preliminary judgment of the problem by checking for odor and appearance. 
                  (B)  If a cross connection problem is suspected, notify the manager of water distribution immediately. If the preliminary report indicates the necessity, follow up procedures may be activated by the manager of water distribution before the samples are returned to the laboratory. 
                  (C)  Pick up samples and return them for laboratory testing. When samples of the suspected water are returned to the laboratory immediate tests will be made to determine the nature of the pollutant or contaminant. If the limitations of available test equipment prevent identification of the pollutant, the GA EPD will be contacted and a sample dispatched by a water department courier for additional testing. 
                  If follow-up procedures are activated, at this point the manager of water distribution and the cross-connection control coordinator are both contacted and notified of the situation. Beginning with the initial inspector's preliminary report, the cross-connection control coordinator shall immediately examine the cross-connection control files to determine potential sources of contamination in the area of concern. The manager of water distribution will begin an evaluation of the problem and activate any or all of the following options he believes proper. 
                  (A)  Direct the emergency line crews to open hydrants in the problem area and flush the lines. 
                  (B)  If an identified potentially hazardous cross-connection is in the vicinity of the problem area (as shown on the location map with the hydrants and valves), he may contact the responsible persons (from the cross-connection control files) and with system services personnel make an immediate inspection. If a cross-connection exists, it will be corrected or the water service disconnected. If the customer, whom is responsible for the incident, can be identified, then said customer will bear the cost of correcting the affected systems. 
                  (C)  Direct the emergency line crews to close valves to isolate the problem area from the total distribution system. 
                  (D)  Notify customers in the affected areas. 
                  (E)  Should any testing or discovery during this emergency procedure reveal a health hazard contamination, additional checks to establish the problem area limits will be made, the problem area flushed and treated until proven safe. This situation would also involve using local radio and television media and water department personnel to inform the public and make personal contact with each customer in the problem area. 
                  It is the policy of the Coweta County Water Department to provide for personnel to be on duty or on call to execute the above emergency plan at all times. This procedure also requires operating personnel to inform the management of emergency problems.

The market value of the building means (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
                  For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include those improvements of a building required to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions, which have been pre-identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project. 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home park or subdivision is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this ordinance which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this ordinance.

                  Sec. 69.5. - Wireless telecommunications towers and facilities. 
                  The Telecommunications Act of 1996 affirmed the County of Coweta's authority concerning the placement, construction and modification of wireless telecommunications facilities. Coweta County finds that wireless telecommunications facilities may pose significant concerns to the health, safety, public welfare, character and environment of the county and its inhabitants. 
                  The county also recognizes that facilitating the development of wireless service technology can be an economic development asset to the county and of significant benefit to the county and its residents. In order to ensure that the placement, construction or modification of wireless telecommunications facilities is consistent with the county's land use policies, the county is adopting a single, comprehensive, wireless telecommunications facilities application and permit process. The intent of this local ordinance [Ord. No. 022-08] is to minimize impact of wireless telecommunications facilities, establish a fair and efficient process for review and approval of applications, assure an integrated, comprehensive review of the visual and environmental impacts of such facilities, and protect the health, safety and welfare of Coweta County.

                  (a)  Applicants for wireless telecommunications facilities shall locate, site and erect said wireless telecommunications facilities in accordance with the following priorities, one being the highest priority and five being the lowest priority: 
                  1.  On government-owned properties or facilities. 
                  2.  On existing towers or other structures without increasing the height of the tower or structure. 
                  3.  On properties in areas zoned for business use. 
                  4.  On properties in areas zoned for agricultural use. 
                  5.  On properties in areas zoned for residential use. 
                  (b)  If the proposed site is not proposed for the highest priority listed above, then a detailed explanation and justification must be provided as to why a site of all higher priority designations was not selected. The person seeking such an exception must satisfactorily demonstrate the reason or reasons why such a permit should be granted for the proposed site, and the hardship that would be incurred by the applicant if the permit were not granted for the wireless facility as proposed. 
                  (c)  An applicant may not by-pass sites of higher priority by stating the site proposed is the only site leased or selected or because there is an existing lease with a landowner. An application shall address colocation as an option. If such option is not proposed, the applicant must explain to the reasonable satisfaction of the county why colocation is commercially impracticable or otherwise impracticable. Agreements between providers limiting or prohibiting colocation shall not be a valid basis for any claim of commercial impracticability or hardship. 
                  (d)  Notwithstanding the above, the county may approve any site located within an area in the above list of priorities, provided that the county finds that the proposed site is in the best interest of the health, safety and welfare of the county and its inhabitants and will not have a deleterious effect on the nature and character of the community and neighborhood. Conversely, the county may direct that the proposed location be changed to another location that is more in keeping with the goals of this section and the public interest as determined by county. 
                  (e)  The applicant shall submit a detailed written report demonstrating the applicant's review of the above locations in order of priority, demonstrating the technological reason for the site selection. If appropriate, based on selecting a site of lower priority, a detailed written explanation as to why sites of a higher priority were not selected shall be included with the application, including the technical justification for such. 
                  (f)  Notwithstanding that a potential site may be situated in an area of highest priority or highest available priority, the county may disapprove an application for any of the following reasons: 
                  1.  Conflict with safety and safety-related codes and requirements; 
                  2.  Conflict with the historic nature or character of a neighborhood or district; 
                  3.  The use or construction of wireless telecommunications facilities which is contrary to an already stated purpose of a specific zoning or land use designation; 
                  4.  The placement and location of wireless telecommunications facilities which would create an unacceptable risk, or the reasonable probability of such, to residents, the public, employees and agents of the county, or employees of the service provider or other service providers; 
                  5.  The placement and location of a wireless telecommunications facility would result in a conflict with or compromise in or change the nature or character of the surrounding area; 
                  6.  Conflicts with the provisions of this section; 
                  7.  Failure to submit a complete application as required under this section. 
                  (g)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this section, for good cause shown, such as the ability to utilize a shorter or less intrusive facility elsewhere and still accomplish the primary service objective, the county may require the relocation of a proposed site, including allowing for the fact that relocating the site chosen by the applicant may require the use of more than one site to provide substantially the same service if the relocation could result in a less intrusive facility or facilities, singly or in combination. 
                  (9)  Shared use of wireless telecommunications facilities and other structures. 
                  (a)  The county, as opposed to the construction of a new tower, requires wireless facilities to be located on existing towers or other suitable structures without increasing the height of the tower or structure, unless such is proven to be technologically impracticable. The applicant shall submit a comprehensive report inventorying all existing towers and other suitable structures within one mile of the location of any proposed new tower, unless the applicant can show that some other distance is more appropriate and reasonable and demonstrate conclusively why an existing tower or other suitable structure cannot be used. 
                  (b)  An applicant intending to locate on an existing tower or other suitable structure shall be required to document the intent of the existing owner to permit its use by the applicant. 
                  (c)  Such shared use shall consist only of the minimum antenna array technologically required to provide service primarily and essentially within the county, to the extent practicable, unless good cause is shown. 
                  (10)  Height of telecommunications tower(s). 
                  (a)  All new towers shall be of the monopole type, unless such is able to be proven to be technologically impracticable. No new towers of a lattice or guyed-type shall be permitted, unless relief is otherwise expressly granted. 
                  (b)  The applicant shall submit documentation justifying the technical need by the service provider for the total height of any tower, facility and/or antenna requested and the basis therefore. To enable verification of the need for the requested height, documentation in the form of propagation studies must include all backup data used to produce the studies at the height requested and at a minimum of ten feet lower height. Such documentation will be analyzed in the context of the justification of the height needed to provide service primarily and essentially within the county, to the extent practicable, unless good cause is shown. 
                  (c)  The maximum permitted total height of a new tower shall be 150 feet above preconstruction ground level, unless it can be proven that such height would prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of service in the intended service area. The 150 feet maximum permitted height is not as-of-right height, but rather the maximum permitted height, absent proof of the technological need for a greater height. 
                  (d)  Notwithstanding the 150 feet maximum permitted height, telecommunications towers and facilities shall be no taller than the minimum height technologically necessary to enable the provision of wireless service coverage or capacity as needed within the county, and only within the county. 
                  (e)  Spacing or the distance between towers shall be such that the service may be provided without exceeding the maximum permitted height. 
                  (11)  Visibility of wireless telecommunications facilities. 
                  (a)  [Artificial lighting.] Wireless telecommunications facilities shall not be artificially lighted or marked, except as required by ordinance. 
                  (b)  Stealth. All new wireless telecommunications facilities, including, but not limited to, towers, shall utilize stealth or camouflage techniques and technology, unless such can be shown to be either commercially or technologically impracticable. 
                  (c)  Dual mode. In order to minimize the number of antenna arrays and thus the visual impact, the county may require the use of dual mode antennas to be used, including by two different carriers, unless it can be proven that such will not work technologically and that such would have the effect of prohibiting the provision of service. 
                  (d)  Tower finish/color. Towers shall be galvanized and/or painted with a rust-preventive paint of an appropriate color to harmonize with the surroundings and shall be maintained in accordance with the requirements of this section. 
                  (e)  Lighting. If lighting is required, applicant shall provide a detailed plan for sufficient lighting of as unobtrusive and inoffensive an effect as is permissible under state and federal regulations. All towers requiring lighting shall be lighted so as to effectively eliminate the ground scatter effect of the lighting and so as to prevent the light from being seen from the ground. 
                  (f)  Flush mounting. All new or replacement antennas, except omni-directional whip antennas, shall be flush-mounted on any tower or other structure, unless the applicant can prove that it is technologically impracticable. 
                  (g)  Placement on building - facie. If attached to a building, all antennas shall be mounted on the facie of the building and camouflaged so as to match the color and, if possible, texture of the building or in a manner so as to make the antennas as visually innocuous and undetectable as is possible given the facts and circumstances involved. 
                  (h)  Lighting - preventing ground scatter effect. For any wireless facility for which lighting is required under the FAA's regulations, or that for any reason has lights attached, all such lighting shall be affixed with technology that enables the light to be seen as intended from the air, but that prevents the ground scatter effect so that it [is] not able to be seen from the ground to a height of at least 12 degrees vertical for a distance of at least one mile in a level terrain situation. Such device must be compliant with or not in conflict with FAA regulations. A physical shield may be used, as long as the light is able to be seen from the air, as intended by the FAA. 
                  (i)  [Retrofitting may be required.] In the event a tower that is lighted is modified, at the time of the modification the county may require that the tower be retrofitted with the technology set forth in the preceding paragraph (f) of this subsection. 
                  (12)  Security of wireless telecommunications facilities. All wireless telecommunications facilities and antennas shall be located, fenced or otherwise secured in a manner that prevents unauthorized access. Specifically: 
                  (a)  All antennas, towers and other supporting structures, including guy anchor points and wires, shall be made inaccessible to individuals and constructed or shielded in such a manner that they cannot be climbed or collided with; and 
                  (b)  Transmitters and telecommunications control points shall be installed in such a manner that they are readily accessible only to persons authorized to operate or service them. 
                  (13)  Signage. Wireless telecommunications facilities shall contain a sign no larger than four square feet in order to provide adequate notification to persons in the immediate area of the presence of RF radiation or to control exposure to RF radiation within a given area. A sign of the same size is also to be installed to contain the name(s) of the owner(s) and operator(s) of the antenna(s) as well as emergency phone number(s). The sign shall be on the equipment shelter or cabinet of the applicant and be visible from the access point of the site and must identify the equipment owner of the shelter or cabinet. On tower sites, an FCC registration site, as applicable, is also to be present. The signs shall not be lighted, unless applicable law, rule or regulation requires lighting. No other signage, including advertising, shall be permitted. 
                  (14)  District size and setbacks. 
                  (a)  All proposed towers and any other proposed wireless telecommunications facility attachment structures shall be set back from abutting parcels, recorded rights-of-way and road and street lines by the greater of the following distances: a distance equal to the height of the proposed tower or wireless telecommunications facility structure plus ten percent of the height of the tower or structure, otherwise known as the fall zone, or the existing setback requirement of the underlying zoning district, whichever is greater. Any accessory structure shall be located so as to comply with the applicable minimum setback requirements for the property on which it is situated. The fall zone or setback shall be measured from the nearest portion of the right-of-way of any public road or thoroughfare and any occupied building or domicile. Further, the nearest portion of any access road to a wireless facility shall be no less than 15 feet from the nearest property line. 
                  (b)  There shall be no development of habitable buildings within the fall zone or setback area set forth in the preceding subsection (a). 
                  (15)  Retention of expert assistance and reimbursement by applicant for permitting new towers or increase in height of an existing tower under subsection (5) or for permitting a structure other than a new or existing tower under subsection (6). 
                  (a)  The county may hire any consultant and/or expert necessary to assist the county in reviewing and evaluating the application, including the construction and modification of the site, once permitted, and any site inspections. 
                  (b)  To prevent the taxpayers from having to bear the cost related to the issue of the regulation of wireless telecommunications facilities, an applicant shall deposit with the county funds sufficient to reimburse the county for all reasonable costs of consultant and expert evaluation and consultation to the county in connection with the review of any application where applicable, the lease negotiation, the pre-approval evaluation, and including the construction and modification of the site, once permitted. The initial deposit shall be $6,500.00. The placement of the $6,500.00 with the county shall precede the pre-application meeting or any work being done as regards [to] processing an application. The county will maintain a separate escrow account for all such funds. The county's consultants/experts shall invoice the county for its services in reviewing the application, including the construction and modification of the site, once permitted. The initial deposit shall not be increased without action by the board of commissioners finding that the initial application request has been modified, that the scope of the review is unique, or the applicant has failed to cooperate with consultant's review causing the consultant to spend substantial time and effort to complete the evaluation of the application. However, if at any time during the process this escrow account has a balance less than $2,500.00, and the board of commissioners finds that the increase is warranted, the applicant shall immediately, upon notification by the county, replenish said escrow account so that it has a balance of at least $5,000.00. Such additional escrow funds shall be deposited with the county before any further action or consideration is taken on the application. In the event that the amount held in escrow is more than the amount of the actual invoicing at the conclusion of the project, the remaining balance shall be promptly refunded to the applicant. 
                  (c)  To prevent the taxpayers from having to bear any cost related to the issue of the regulation of wireless telecommunications facilities, no work shall be done on an application for which the full amount of the escrow deposit as set forth in the preceding subsection (b) of this section has not been placed with the county. In the event the escrow deposit minimum balance as set forth in subsection (b) is not maintained, all work on the application shall cease until the deposit is replenished as required. 
                  (d)  The total amount of the funds needed as set forth in subsection (b) of this section may vary with the scope and complexity of the project, the completeness of the application and other information as may be needed to complete the necessary review, analysis and inspection of any construction or modification. 
                  (e)  Records of all outside costs associated with the review and permitting process shall be maintained and available for public inspection, in compliance with applicable Georgia law. 
                  (f)  Any application submitted to the county's consultant shall be reviewed by the consultant for completion within 30 days of submittal to the county. Once the application has been found to be complete, in no event shall the consultant's recommendation and evaluation process on the application take more than 60 days. 
                  (16)  Public hearing and notification requirements. Applications for a special use permit for a new tower or for any facility that increases the height of the structure to which it is attached must comply with and be processed in accordance to article 29, amendments of this section. 
                  (17)  Action on an application for a special use permit for wireless telecommunications facilities. 
                  (a)  In addition to the requirements set forth in article 29 of this section, the county will undertake a review of an application pursuant to this article in a timely fashion, consistent with its responsibilities, and shall act within a reasonable period of time given the relative complexity of the application and the circumstances, with due regard for the public's interest and need to be involved, and the applicant's desire for a timely resolution. 
                  (b)  The county may refer any application or part thereof to any advisory or other committee for a nonbinding recommendation. 
                  (c)  After the public hearing and after formally considering the application, the county may approve, approve with conditions, or deny a special use permit. Its decision shall be in writing and shall be supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record. The burden of proof for the grant of the permit shall always be upon the applicant. 
                  (d)  If the county approves the special use permit for wireless telecommunications facilities, then the applicant shall be notified of such approval in writing within 30 calendar days of the board of commissioners' action, and the special use permit shall be issued within 30 days after such approval. 
                  (e)  If the county denies the special use permit for wireless telecommunications facilities, then the applicant shall be notified of such denial in writing within 30 calendar days of the county's action and shall set forth in writing the reason or reasons for the denial. 
                  (18)  Extent and parameters of special use permit for wireless telecommunications facilities. The extent and parameters of a special use permit for wireless telecommunications facilities shall be as follows: 
                  (a)  Such special use permit shall not be assigned, transferred or conveyed without the express prior written notification to the county. 
                  (b)  In the event of a violation of this section, following an opportunity to cure and, if not cured within the time frame set forth in the notice of violation, a hearing shall be held upon due prior notice to the applicant. Following such hearing, if found to be in violation of this section, the special use permit may be revoked, canceled, or terminated for a violation of the conditions and provisions of the special use permit, or for a material violation of this section or other applicable law, rule or regulation. 
                  (c)  Notice of a violation and of the date, time and place of a hearing shall be provided by registered mail to the last known address of the holder of the special use permit. 
                  (19)  Application fee. At the time that a person submits an application for a special use permit for a new tower, such person shall pay a nonrefundable application fee set forth in the county's fee schedule as may be amended or changed from time-to-time. 
                  (20)  Removal and performance security. The applicant and the owner of record of any proposed wireless telecommunications facilities property site shall, at its cost and expense, be jointly required to execute and file with the county a bond, or other form of security acceptable to the county as to type of security and the form and manner of execution, in an amount of at least $75,000.00 for a tower with such sureties as are deemed sufficient by the county to assure the faithful performance of the terms and conditions of this section and conditions of any special use permit issued pursuant to this section. The full amount of the bond or security shall remain in full force and effect throughout the term of the special use permit and/or until any necessary site restoration is completed to restore the site to a condition comparable to that, which existed prior to the issuance of the original special use permit. 
                  (21)  Reservation of authority to inspect wireless telecommunications facilities.

                  (Ord. No. 022-08, 7-15-08; Ord. No. 006-09, 4-16-09; Ord. No. 018-09, 7-21-09) 
                  Sec. 69.6. - Private wastewater spray irrigation field facility (P.W.S.I.F.F.). 
                  Purpose. In the basic recognition of the unique nature of certain activities, the intent of this section of this zoning and development ordinance is to assure that private wastewater spray field facilities will be allowed under such conditions and at such locations that they will pose no threat to the safety, health, and general welfare of the citizens of the County. It also serves to establish design standards to ensure proper disposal of treated wastewater and provide continual maintenance of the facilities to ensure the environment is protected. These standards are in addition to those required by the State of Georgia Environmental Protection Division (E.P.D.) in Criteria for Slow Rate Land Treatment and Urban Water Reuse, which is fully incorporated by reference and made part of this ordinance. 
                  Special use permit. Any applicant desiring to establish a private wastewater spray irrigation field facility must submit to the board of commissioners for its consideration, a plan for such proposed use. This plan shall meet or exceed the requirements for a conceptual site plan as set forth in article 29, section 290 of the Coweta County Zoning and Development Ordinance and requirements of E.P.D. After due public hearing and notice thereof as described in the procedures for rezoning, the board of commissioners shall approve or disapprove each such proposed facility in accordance with the following criteria that shall be considered along with those criteria set out for zoning in general as described under article 29 of this ordinance. 
                  Design standards. In accordance with the Coweta County Zoning and Development Ordinance, article 24 (site plan requirements), the following design standards, information, submittals, and procedures shall be required for system approval: 
                  (1)  Prior to the issuance of development permits for construction or operation of any private wastewater spray irrigation field, a detailed site plan, hydrogeologic studies, engineering and operation plans, reports and any required information or data necessary to adequately review design, permits and operation shall be submitted to and approved by the county's development review committee including but not limited to: 
                  (a)  Coweta County Water and Sewerage Authority. 
                  (b)  Coweta County Environmental Health Department. 
                  (c)  Coweta County Planning Department. 
                  (d)  Coweta County Engineering and Development Department. 
                  (e)  Coweta County Building Department. 
                  (2)  Engineering reports and submittals shall comply with the requirements as delineated in the State of Georgia E.P.D. Criteria for Slow Rate Land Treatment and Urban Water Reuse requirements. 
                  (3)  Copies of engineering reports, monitoring reports, reviews of plans and operations generated by or for Georgia E.P.D. must also be provided to the Coweta County Water and Sewerage Authority. The same documents generated by or for Coweta County officials must be provided to Georgia E.P.D. for their review. 
                  (4)  The irrigation shall be limited to the application rate as determined acceptable by the superintendent of the water and sewer department, and the State of Georgia E.P.D. upon review of the information submitted pursuant to the conditions set forth herein. 
                  (5)  The wastewater shall not be stored or irrigated on areas not totally under the legal control or ownership of the permittee. 
                  (6)  No wastewater retention or detention basins shall be allowed within the area covered by a spray irrigation land application site of a P.W.S.I.F.F., except for stormwater collection or repumping facilities. 
                  (7)  Design development shall include analysis of spray field soil(s) that is done at a frequency of one boring to one-half acre of spray field area. This level of testing will verify soil survey maps and identify the presence of a soil variant within a soil series. 
                  One hundred percent replacement area for all spray fields shall be provided. For each replacement area a soil sampling of one boring for each one-half acre shall be conducted. All information required by E.P.D. in the LAS Guidelines Table 2.2-3 shall be submitted for review. Approved replacement areas shall be designated on the approved site plan. 
                  The design shall provide setback distances between the wetted site area subject to land application and surface waters, wetlands and potable water supply wells to ensure compliance with water quality and drinking water standards, and to protect the public health, safety and welfare. All systems shall be designed to minimize adverse effects resulting from noise, odor, lighting and aerosol drift. Adequate site area shall be provided for operation and maintenance, and for controlling emergency discharges. 
                  The applicant will be required to perform samples of monitoring of wells as indicated by the land application system permit to submit to the Coweta County Water and Sewerage Authority to detect any problems before they affect the surrounding neighbors. 
                  Setbacks shall be 500 feet from the edge of the wetted area to any potable water supply wells that are existing or have been approved by the environmental health department (but not yet constructed). Setback distances from the edge of the wetted area to buildings, floodplains (100 and 500), nonpotable wells, wetlands or to the site property line shall be 300 feet. Setback distances from waters shall be established case-by-case based on compliance with applicable water quality standards or as directed by the State of Georgia E.P.D. 
                  The minimum buffer distances described above shall only be used if, based on review of the soils and hydrogeology of the area, the proposed hydraulic loading rate, quality of the discharge water, expected travel time of the groundwater to the potable water supply wells and surface waters, and similar considerations, there is reasonable assurance that applicable water quality standards will not be violated. A reduction of the minimum buffer distances from wells or surface waters may be considered if it can be shown that the effluent quality exceeds standards for secondary treatment and basic disinfection. 
                  The edge of the wetted perimeter of the land application system shall be at least 300 feet from outdoor public eating, drinking and bathing facilities. 
                  A minimum of 150 feet of all setback areas shall be established as a vegetative buffer as described below. 
                  [(8)  Reserved.] 
                  (9)  An inventory of all potable and nonpotable wells for a distance of 2,500 feet from the parcel property line shall be submitted with the hydrogeologic assessment. 
                  (10)  Any existing well(s) in the spray field site shall have their casings sealed by grout at the top and the bottom of the casing, or the wells will be abandoned in accordance with the Coweta County Health Department and the Georgia Water Well Standards Act. 
                  (11)  A vegetative buffer of a rapid growth variety and dense nature that shall grow to at least 12 feet high and at least 50 feet wide which is within the 150 foot buffer, shall be maintained outside the area where spray irrigation takes place as a buffer along property lines abutting property not owned or controlled by the owner. The vegetative buffer should be planted prior to the operation of the spray field and attain a minimum height of six feet within two years of the planting date. The planting of cedar and/or other evergreens would be effective against wind drift where they would be compatible with the local area. The new plantings will be oriented so the rows will be perpendicular to the fall of the land. This will preclude erosion and allow for better soil assimilation. The buffer is subject to approval by the director of planning. Existing trees, native vegetation or planted vegetation may serve as a buffer. 
                  (12)  No irrigation or other method of disposal shall take place until an operation and maintenance manual is written for the spray field and is approved by the general manager of the Coweta County Water and Sewerage Authority. 
                  (13)  Appropriate warning signs shall be posted every 300 feet around the site to designate the nature of the site use. 
                  (14)  A waste characterization report shall be prepared and submitted for approval by the general manager of the Coweta County Water and Sewerage Authority. The waste characterization report shall recommend parameters to be monitored in the required ground and surface water-monitoring program. Existing ground and surface water quality shall be considered in making recommendations. 
                  (15)  The owner shall provide calculations and a design which demonstrate adequate stormwater facilities to meet the 25-year, 24-hour storm event and requirements of Coweta County Water and Sewerage Authority development standards under saturated soil conditions. 
                  (16)  No irrigation or other methods of disposal shall take place until a detailed hydrogeologic investigation, groundwater modeling study/assessment, and an environmental impact assessment with a groundwater monitoring plan shall be submitted by the owner for review and approval by the general manager of the Coweta County Water and Sewerage Authority and other permitting authorities and agencies as set forth herein. The study shall provide calculations for mass balance, nutrient assimilative capacity, and other appropriate details. The study and associated plan shall demonstrate that the hydraulic application rate at the proposed effluent treatment level shall not degrade off site surface or groundwater quantity or quality. A load test shall be conducted to calibrate the groundwater model to assure the applicability of the assumption's calculations and results of the studies. 
                  (17)  The owner shall: 
                  (a)  Design the spray field to prevent the production of odors resulting from failure of the ground to accept the applied load or anaerobic decomposition of the processing water. Specific prevention features shall include: 
                  1.  Refraining from irrigation of fields until uniform vegetative cover is established over the entire spray area and not until buffers around spray areas have been implemented. Potable water must be used to establish vegetative cover. 
                  2.  Design irrigation to maintain an aerated root zone at least two feet in depth throughout the application area to prevent surface ponding and puddling. 
                  3.  Install piezometers to provide for routine monitoring of water table elevations. 
                  4.  Design irrigation cells on spray field sites to permit daily rotation among a number of cells and prevent prolonged irrigation of any single cell. 
                  5.  Utilize low trajectory, low mist spray heads. 
                  6.  Provide permanent recirculation pumps for immediate repumping from spray field stormwater retention ponds. 
                  7.  Design spray field to minimize an increase of shallow groundwater elevations offsite. 
                  8.  Provide capacity to retain 12 days of average production generated effluent or provide a plan that adequately demonstrates procedures to be implemented during those periods when soil conditions are not conducive to spray field use. 
                  9.  In addition to the automatic shut-down safeguards required by E.P.D., the security system must automatically dial an alert to the owner or operator of the facility when a pump malfunction is occurring or when low pressure is detected. The telecommunication system must be activated whenever a class II operator is off-site. 
                  Operation. The following operational procedures shall be implemented to assure the facility shall operate as designed: 
                  (1)  Necessary precautions shall be taken to prevent over spray or irrigation of county-maintained roadways or public rights-of-way, or adjacent property owners. 
                  (2)  Water quality analysis shall be performed by a laboratory certified by the State of Georgia E.P.D. A quality assurance project plan (Q.A.P.P.) shall be submitted by the owner 45 days prior to the effective date of operation. The plan shall address all sampling and analyses required by ordinance. This Q.A.P.P. must be approved by the superintendent of the water and sewer department prior to operation of the spray field. 
                  (3)  All wastewater shall be retained on the subject property with no off-site runoff permitted pursuant to design standards, condition (15), with the understanding that discharges resulting from rainfall in excess of the design storm is anticipated. If the spray field becomes saturated and runoff is generated, the owner shall immediately notify the general manager of the Coweta County Water and Sewerage Authority and cease using that portion of the spray field until the soil and site conditions are conducive to allow use that can meet the design standards without potential off-site runoff or degradation of surface or groundwater quantity or quality. 
                  (4)  Freshwater flushing of transmission mains shall be performed if system is out of service for a period of one week to prevent line septicity.

The permitting procedures, design guidelines, and operating guidelines for private wastewater spray irrigation field facilities set forth in section 69.6 of this ordinance apply to on-site treatment and disposal practices of permitted system operators. The ordinance limits the disposal of reclaimed water to spray fields that are part of the permitted field facility. Conditions of the field facility site determine the water purification standard that E.P.D. requires before spray irrigation of the field can take place. However, advanced treatment technology is now available and can treat wastewater to levels of purity that allow its safe reuse on public access areas. The practice of spray irrigation with highly treated wastewater is encouraged by the State of Georgia because it conserves potable water supplies. The terms "reclaimed water", "highly treated wastewater", and "urban reuse spray area" are defined in article 3, definitions of terms. 
                  The Coweta County Commission recognizes that advanced water treatment technology can be implemented by operators of private wastewater spray irrigation field facilities and that the controlled irrigation of highly treated wastewater onto specific kinds of areas will benefit the community by conserving public supplies of potable water. Therefore, the Coweta County Commission herein sets forth the parameters of such a practice in Coweta County. 
                  (1)  The production and disposal of highly treated wastewater shall follow the design standards set forth in Criteria for Slow Rate Land Treatment and Urban Water Reuse, Section 5; Georgia Department of Natural Resources, Environmental Protection Division as amended except where county requirements are more stringent. 
                  (2)  A special use permit is required to reuse highly treated wastewater and should be sought in tandem with the special use permit required for the private wastewater spray irrigation field facility. No spray irrigation or other method of disposal of highly treated wastewater shall take place until project review under section 69.6 specifications of this ordinance have been completed and site evaluation reports for disposal sites have been reviewed by the development review committee (see design standards (1)(a)—(e)), and not until a permit has been granted for each water reuse spray area. 
                  In addition to the requirements set forth in section 69.6 of this ordinance, the following requirements apply to urban water reuse spray areas and must be met: 
                  (a)  Design development must identify installation of advanced wastewater treatment technology, verification that the system will meet the turbidity requirements for spray irrigation of public access areas, design, location, and capacity of storage for highly treated wastewater and for reject water, the wastewater monitoring and reporting plan, and the operating and site management plan. An operator must be on-site when the plant is in operation and pumping reuse water. 
                  The design development report including the above documentation will be provided by the applicant to the general manager of the Coweta County Water and Sewerage Authority. In addition, any document required by E.P.D. will be required for review by the general manager of the Coweta County Water and Sewerage Authority. 
                  (b)  Each urban reuse spray area must be permitted as a special use. A description of each urban reuse spray area and a copy of the contract between the wastewater field facility operator and the owner of the urban reuse spray area must be submitted for review and approval by the general manager of the Coweta County Water and Sewerage Authority. Disposal of highly treated wastewater will be permitted on a case-by-case basis. 
                  (c)  The special use permit application submitted by the applicant must include a plan for the distribution of highly treated wastewater to the urban water reuse spray area. If holding tanks are required, they must be permitted by the building official. The application must include blue-line drawings showing the proximity of reclaimed water lines and hydrants to existing or proposed domestic water lines and hydrants. The design development report and the site evaluation must show the proximity of public eating, drinking and bathing facilities to the spray areas. Other information as it may be required by staff to review the proposed project must be made available. Plans shall also show the location of storage tanks holding highly treated wastewater and treatment facility storage of reject water. For reject water, an operator must provide a minimum storage capacity equal to three days of flow at the average daily design flow of the treatment facility. The plant must have sufficient excess capacity to assimilate and treat the reject water stored off-line within one week. 
                  One or more design standards (i.e. setbacks or buffers) as specified in section 69.6 or article 24, site plan requirements, of this ordinance that apply to spray irrigation fields on the site of the wastewater treatment field facility may be waived by the board of commissioners in the permitting of water reuse spray areas. Relief of such standards shall not nullify the intent of this ordinance to maintain the public health, safety and general welfare if such relief is granted. 
                  (3)  Disposal of highly treated wastewater into steams is not permitted. Only under extreme circumstances which may occur during prolonged periods of precipitation will the county or E.P.D. recognize the necessity for limited wet weather discharges. Both Coweta County Water and Sewerage Authority and E.P.D. require notice of a spill or bypass within 24 hours of the incident. 
                  (4)  The applicant shall notify the public by posting advisory signs in areas where urban water reuse is practiced. The advisory notices shall characterize the safety of and community benefit of urban water reuse spray area projects. The agencies managing golf courses, recreational areas, or grounds where fountains or impoundments are located might also notate score cards or promotional materials distributed to personnel or patrons stating that reuse is practiced and is beneficial. 
                  Monitoring. The following procedures shall be implemented to assure that facility impacts to ground and surface water quality and quantity are monitored: 
                  (1)  On-site and off-site groundwater shall meet the water quality requirements of the land application system permit issued by the State of Georgia E.P.D. 
                  (2)  A ground and surface water monitoring program and a soil monitoring program shall be developed and implemented prior to the use of lands for reclaimed water disposal. The monitoring shall be in accordance with standards and practices as delineated in the rules and regulations of the State of Georgia's Water Quality Act and the State of Georgia E.P.D. Criteria for Slow Rate Land Treatment and Urban Water Reuse guidelines. The objective of the programs shall be to establish ambient (pre-use) conditions, to monitor the long-range impacts on the ground and surface water system, and to effectively manage soil conditions, crop selection and growth. Surface water sampling locations, well locations and depths shall be adequate to monitor the impacts to adjacent wetlands and floodplains. Plans with adequate justification and ground and surface water modeling analysis for surface water sampling location(s), monitor well location(s), well construction, depth, installation, and numbers shall be submitted to and must be approved by the general manager of the Coweta County Water and Sewerage Authority prior to construction. Installation and development of groundwater monitoring wells required by this ordinance; shall be performed by a licensed well driller with substantial experience in drilling groundwater-monitoring wells. Parameters for chemical analysis, frequency of analysis, and other scheduling pertaining to the monitoring program shall be determined by the general manager of the Coweta County Water and Sewerage Authority. Soil monitoring shall be conducted by a geotechnical engineer and is required annually. 
                  (3)  At the end of each year of data collection a written technical report signed and sealed by a qualified professional engineer must be submitted to the general manager of the Coweta County Water and Sewerage Authority which summarizes and interprets the soil monitoring data, the water quality data, and water level measurements collected from the date of the original special use permit (SUP) issuance. This report shall contain, but is not limited to the following: 
                  (a)  Statistical analyses; 
                  (b)  Tabular and graphical displays of the data including hydrographs and water table contour maps referenced to land surface and/or N.G.V.D. for all monitor wells and surface water stations; 
                  (c)  Trend analysis; 
                  (d)  Comparisons among wells in different zones and/or aquifers; 
                  (e)  Relationships between effluent, surface and groundwater quality including relationship of original baseline water quality; 
                  (f)  Discussion of problems occurring, excessive mounding, and/or discharges off-site during the year; 
                  (g)  Discussion of erratic, missing and/or poorly correlated data; and 
                  (h)  Soil sampling data from borings taken at the rate of one for each one acre and in changing soil series, one boring for each one-half acre. 
                  (4)  Rainfall shall be monitored at the site daily and results included in monthly and annual reports. 
                  (5)  County personnel shall be granted permission to enter all P.W.S.I.F.F. sites to monitor the performance of the system and to determine compliance with this ordinance. The owner shall be notified no later than the morning of the inspection day and shall provide access to all areas. 
                  (6)  The owner shall maintain optimum growth conditions for crops used as vegetative cover. Vigorous agronomic cover crop growth is essential to maintain nitrogen uptake rates assumed in design. Therefore, annual soil evaluation must be conducted to determine if soil supplements are needed. Soil monitoring of wetted field areas shall be conducted according to the guidelines provided in Table 4.2-1 of the LAS Guidelines, as amended, but with the number of borings specified in [subsection] (3)(h) above. 
                  (7)  The owner of the system shall monitor and test a down gradient private potable well quarterly, or as often as complaints indicate. The location of the well shall be determined by hydrogeologic investigation and groundwater modeling study and shall be indicated on the groundwater-monitoring plan supplied by the owner. The location of the well must be approved by the general manager of the Coweta County Water and Sewerage Authority. If at any time test results indicate a violation of drinking water standards, the owner of the system shall immediately retest the well and if the violation is confirmed by a retest, the owner of the system shall hire, at their own expense, an independent groundwater hydrologist subject to the owner of the system and well owner's approval to evaluate the source of the violation and to propose solution(s) to correct the source of the violation. If the results of these investigations show that the problem is due to the spray field operation then the owner of the system, at their sole expense, shall take immediate corrective action as required. 
                  When the final study is complete and approved, the owner shall determine an amount at least equal to 110 percent of the total cost to accomplish the above-stated requirement and with the approval of the general manager of the sewerage authority and the board of county commissioners, provide a security instrument made out to the board of county commissioners to cover the anticipated cost of corrective action. The security instrument shall remain in full effect until released by the county.

                  c.  During the special use permit review, the intensity of the proposed use, and the potential impact on the surrounding neighborhood, including the aesthetic impact of strict enforcement of the development standards, shall be considered. This consideration shall in turn govern the applicability of the following development standards, which, unless noted as a requirement of the special use permit, shall be waived: 
                  1.  Paved drives. 
                  2.  Paved parking areas. 
                  3.  Building design criteria. 
                  4.  Landscaping requirements. 
                  d.  A pre-development site plan and an as-built site plan, as indicated in article 24, development regulations shall be required. 
                  e.  Buffers, when deemed necessary, shall be established in accordance with article 25, buffer area and screening requirements, except that the width and location of the required buffer areas shall be established during the special use permit process.

                  A.  Residential home occupations, where permitted, must meet the following special requirements: 
                  1.  A home occupation is subordinate to the use of a dwelling unit for residential purposes. No more than 25 percent of the floor area of the dwelling unit may be used in connection with a home occupation or for storage purposes in connection with a home occupation. 
                  2.  No more than two home occupations shall be permitted within a single dwelling unit. 
                  3.  A home occupation shall be carried on wholly within the principal use building. No home occupation or any storage of goods, materials, or products connected with a home occupation shall be allowed in accessory buildings or garages which are detached. 
                  4.  The residential home occupation is limited to employment of residents of the property. 
                  5.  A home occupation shall produce no noise or obnoxious odors, vibrations, glare, fumes, or electrical interference detectable to normal sensory perceptions outside the principal structure. 
                  6.  No traffic shall be generated by such home occupations in greater volume than would normally be expected in a residential neighborhood and any need for parking generated by the conduct of such home occupation shall be met by providing off-street parking space and located in rear or side yard. 
                  7.  On the premises, retail sales are prohibited except for the retail sales of products or goods produced or fabricated on the premises as a result of the home occupation. 
                  8.  There shall be no exterior indication of the home occupation or variation from the residential character of the principal use. 
                  9.  No on-street parking of business-related vehicles (either marked or commercially equipped) shall be permitted at any home. No business-related vehicle larger than a van, panel truck or pickup truck is permitted to park overnight on the premises. The number of business-related vehicles is one. All business-related vehicles shall be parked in the rear of the premises.

                  The board of commissioners recognize the peculiar problem posed by small contractors who do most, if not all, of their work away from the site of their business and that the business locations serve as no more than a place for the principal of the contracting business to do paperwork, receive phone calls and receive mail. As a result of the unique nature of the contracting enterprise the commissioners specifically recognize that a contracting business may be located in a residential area even if that contracting business employs people outside of the residents of the property. However, no outside persons employed by a contractor can do work on or assemble on or park on the residential premises housing the occupation. Further, no equipment belonging to the contractor can be parked, assembled or maintained at the residence business.

                  The purpose of rural home occupations is to provide a means for residents in the larger lot rural development districts to participate in the type of businesses permitted in residential districts, be able to conduct the home occupation in an accessory building where necessary, and to park on-site, vehicles required for home occupations. Rural home occupations, where permitted, must meet the following special requirements:

                  ARTICLE 7. - RC RURAL CONSERVATION DISTRICT (FORMERLY RR RURAL RESERVE). 
                  Coweta County has adopted a comprehensive land use plan and a future development map to guide land use and development throughout the county. Primary concerns of citizens are the provision of efficient and effective government services and public facilities, and the protection of Coweta's natural land and water resources, and preservation of rural character which together foster a unique sense of place valued by the community. The rural conservation district is intended to provide for agricultural land use, and low density single-family residential land use in an area of Coweta County shown on the future development map as the rural conservation area. Agricultural land uses include farming, forestry, horticulture, wholesale plant propagation, dairying, ranching, and equestrian activities. Rural residential land uses include rural homestead lots, and low density rural residential developments designed to preserve woodland and open land along Coweta's roadways, to preserve primary conservation land: river or stream corridor, areas of vulnerable groundwater recharge, floodplain, steep slopes, habitat of endangered species, archeological sites, cemeteries, and burial grounds, and to provide neighborhoods with their own private, yet common, recreation areas.

Treatment options: For wooded tracts, maintain existing woodland within the landscape strip; for open tracts, install landscaping according to article 26, section 262, quality development corridor district. Development requirements (1)(a) and (b) paragraphs 3 and 4. In addition, use any of the following within the landscape strip: four-board fence, three-board fence, walls of stone or brick (height maximum of four feet), native plants, and mulch material approved by the county arborist. 
                  (6)  Subdivision entrance sign(s) may be placed within the rural design open space in accordance with the requirements of the Coweta County Sign Ordinance. 
                  Figure 1. Illustration of curvilinear alignment and location of landscape strip (no scale). 

                  Appeals to the rural design open space may be made in accordance with article 24, section 240.6, administration, item 2, variances and waivers. The planning director may grant modifications based on tract dimension, topography, size, shape, soil types, slope, and other natural features. 
                  Sec. 71. - Infrastructure requirements. 
                  All lots in RC Districts must meet the following infrastructure requirements:

                  Sec. 84. - General requirements. 
                  1.  Setbacks in the RI-A district shall be as follows: 
                  a.  Individual single-family residential lots shall be separated from the boundary of the parent development tract a distance of 50 feet. 
                  b.  Individual single-family residential lots shall be prohibited from encroaching upon primary conservation areas and shall be permitted to be located upon secondary conservation areas as approved by the planning director when said encroachment shall not result in an overall encroachment of greater than ten percent for the entire development. 
                  2.  A minimum of 60 percent of residential lots shall directly abut or face conservation land or greenway directly or across street. 
                  3.  Density: 
                  a.  Developments shall be permitted to be developed using the infill density calculation on net acreage. 
                  b.  Net acreage shall be defined as the total gross acreage of property minus all primary conservation areas included in the total gross acreage. 
                  c.  Under no circumstance shall any permitted development exceed a total maximum density of one unit per net acre. 
                  d.  Infill density is the average number of units/lots per acre in approved residential subdivision developments contiguous with at least 51 percent or more of the perimeter of the development tract. 
                  e.  Infill density calculation worksheet. Is 51 percent or more of the boundary of the tract directly adjacent to developed subdivision property? (Also include the street frontage, or portion thereof, if the property directly across the street is a developed subdivision.) The portion of the perimeter that is adjacent to nonresidential property may be excluded from this calculation. 
                  If yes, then proceed to Calculation Method. 
                  If no, then this property is not eligible for infill density at this time. 
                  Calculation Method 
                  Perimeter of Tract Boundary (nonresidential boundaries may be excluded) = ____________ lin. ft. × 51% = ____________ 
                  Identify adjoining subdivisions and their density (as indicated on the reverse of this form) which comprise 51 percent of the tract boundary. Also include development directly across the street, if it is part of the 51 percent. Additional lines may be added if necessary. 
                  Adjacent Subdivision ____________ Lin Ft. along boundary ____________ Density Assigned ____________ 
                  Adjacent Subdivision ____________ Lin Ft. along boundary ____________ Density Assigned ____________ 
                  Adjacent Subdivision ____________ Lin Ft. along boundary ____________ Density Assigned ____________ 
                  Adjacent Subdivision ____________ Lin Ft. along boundary ____________ Density Assigned ____________ 
                  Average of all adjacent densities comprising the 51 percent of the perimeter ____________ is the compatible density available to this tract before bonuses. However, the maximum density of 1.0 unit per acre still applies. 
                  The developer shall be required to provide a vicinity map supporting the adjacent developments densities. Such map shall indicate the names of all adjacent subdivisions. Additionally, reference features, such as land lots and street names, shall be included and labeled. 
                  For the purposes of calculating infill densities, the known development types have been assigned the following densities (based on the maximum gross yield that could be achieved from their respective minimum lot sizes). 
                  R-350 developments with a minimum lot size of 3.5 acres = .285 units per acre 
                  R-200 developments with a minimum lot size of 2 acres = .5 units per acre 
                  R-160 developments with a minimum lot size of 1.6 acres = .625 units per acre 
                  R-1 developments with a minimum lot size of .8 of an acre = 1.25 units per acre 
                  Municipally zoned property with a minimum lot size of ____________ = ____________ units per acre 
                  The planning director shall make the final determination of density assigned to adjacent/nearby properties based on the minimum lot size. However, the planning director's decision may be appealed to the board of commissioners, through the normal variance procedures. 
                  4.  Open space. See article 24 for open space standards and criteria. 
                  a.  Developments shall provide a minimum of 40 percent of the total gross acreage as open space. 
                  b.  Developments that provide the social and community uses as permitted by conditional use shall be permitted to count the total built square footage towards the required open space calculations up to a maximum of 20,000 square feet and a maximum of ten percent of the total open space required for the entire development. Social and community uses greater than 20,000 square feet shall be permitted to count towards required open space calculations only upon approval of the planning director when said use are proven to be consistent with the county comprehensive plan. 
                  Sec. 85. - Development improvement requirements. 
                  1.  A development within the RI-A District must meet the following requirement:

                  Sec. 138.8. - Procedures for approval of moderately priced dwelling units. 
                  1.  Purpose and intent. Where moderately priced dwelling units are requested in a mill village in accordance with section 133.2(2)(k) this optional method of development is permitted in order to facilitate the construction of those units. The method permits an increase in residential density within the mill village service zone not to exceed the bonus density in Table 8 of section 136.3 of this article. The additional units that result from the density bonus incentive may be used to construct additional single-family detached residential dwelling units or other residential dwelling unit types that are permitted within the mill village service zone. The concept plan approval and subdivision development procedures of section 138.2(2), sections 135, 136, and 137 must be followed, and in addition the board of commissioners must approve the applicant's request for a conditional use permit subject to the provisions that are provided in this section 138.8. 
                  2.  MPDU agreement required. 
                  a.  Any applicant, in order to obtain approval of a conditional use permit containing MPDU's, must submit to the department of planning and development, with the application for a conditional use permit, a written MPDU agreement approved by the director of planning and the county attorney. The MPDU agreement must include the number, type, location, and plan for staging construction of all dwelling units and such other information as the department requires to determine the applicant's compliance with this article. The MPDU staging plan must be consistent with any applicable land use plan, subdivision plan, or site plan. The staging plan included in the MPDU agreement for all dwelling units must be sequenced so that no more than 50 percent of the market rate dwelling units are built until 100 percent of the MPDUs are built. 
                  b.  If an applicant does not build the MPDU's contained in the staging plan along with or before other dwelling units, the director of planning must withhold any later building permit to that applicant until the MPDU's contained in the staging plan are built. 
                  c.  Recording of covenants. The applicant for a MPDU conditional use permit must execute and record covenants assuring that: 
                  i.  The restrictions of this section run with the land for the entire period of control. 
                  ii.  The covenants will bind the applicant, any assignee, mortgagee, or buyer, and all other parties that receive title to the property. These covenants must be senior to all instruments securing permanent financing. 
                  d.  Later deeds. The seller must state, in any deed or instrument conveying title to an MPDU, that the conveyed property is a MPDU and is subject to the restrictions contained in the covenants required under this section during the control period until the restrictions are released. 
                  3.  Maximum prices of MPDUs. Moderately priced dwelling units must not be sold at prices that exceed the maximum prices established under this section. 
                  a.  Maximum initial sales price. 
                  i.  The initial sales price of any MPDU, including closing costs and brokerage fees, must not exceed an applicable maximum sale price established from time to time by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
                  ii.  The maximum sales prices shall be based upon the ability to pay of persons of moderate income in accordance with the most recent standards established by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development or the Georgia Department of Community Affairs for the Coweta County real estate market. The housing authority of Newnan shall assist in determining the maximum sales price of each unit for the Coweta County real estate market. Sales prices will continue in effect until changed by later federal or state regulation and as directed by the Coweta County Board of Commissioners. 
                  iii.  At the direction of the Coweta County Board of Commissioners, and with the assistance of the housing authority of Newnan, interim adjustments in maximum MPDU sale prices may be made when sufficient changes in costs justify an adjustment. Any interim adjustment must be based on the maximum MPDU sale prices previously established, adjusted by the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index. 
                  4.  Sale of MPDUs to an eligible person or household to purchase for his or her own residence. 
                  a.  Before offering any moderately priced dwelling units, the applicant must notify the planning department of the proposed offering and the date on which the applicant will be ready to begin the marketing to eligible persons. The applicant shall submit two copies of the notice. The notice shall set forth the number of units offered, the floor area for each unit type, a description of the amenities offered in each unit and a statement of the availability of each unit for sale, including information regarding any mortgage financing available to buyers of the designated unit. The planning department will submit one copy of the applicant's notice to the housing authority of Newnan. Submittal of the applicant's notice to the housing authority of Newnan initiates involvement of the housing authority of Newnan with certification of purchasers. 
                  b.  The housing authority of Newnan shall certify each purchaser as a moderate income person or household prior to the purchaser entering a contract to purchase a MPDU. 
                  5.  Enforcement. 
                  a.  This section applies to all agents, successors and assigns of an applicant. 
                  b.  A building permit must not be issued, and a concept plan, preliminary plat, or site plan including MPDU's must not be approved unless it meets the requirements of this section. 
                  c.  The director of planning may deny, suspend, or revoke any building or occupancy permit upon finding a violation of this section. 
                  d.  Any prior approval of a preliminary plan of subdivision, development plan or site plan including MPDU's may be suspended or revoked upon the failure to meet any requirement of this section. 
                  e.  No occupancy permit for a MPDU may be issued to any applicant, or a successor or assign of any applicant, for a building that does not comply with this section. 
                  f.  Coweta County may take legal action to stop or cancel any transfer of an MPDU if any party to the transfer does not comply with all requirements of this section. The director of planning may recover any funds improperly obtained from any sale or rental of an MPDU in violation of this section. 
                  g.  In addition to or instead of any other available remedy, Coweta County may take legal action to enjoin an MPDU owner who violates this section to cease and desist from further violation, or to immediately sell or rent the MPDU in question to an eligible person or household. 
                  6.  Appeals. 
                  a.  Any person aggrieved by any denial, suspension or revocation of approval of a concept plan including an MPDU may appeal to the board of commissioners. 
                  b.  Any person aggrieved by any denial, suspension or revocation of a building or occupancy permit or denial, suspension or revocation of approval of a preliminary plat or site plan including an MPDU may appeal to the board of zoning appeals as provided in article 28.

                  ARTICLE 21. - SCP STREAM CORRIDOR PROTECTION DISTRICT 
                  Purpose. This classification has been established because protecting, restoring and maintaining the chemical, physical and biological integrity of streams and their water resources is of vital importance to the health and welfare of Coweta County citizens. The purpose of the ordinance is to establish protection criteria that will remove pollutants delivered in urban stormwater; reduce erosion and control sedimentation; protect and stabilize streambanks; provide for infiltration of stormwater runoff; maintain base flow of streams; contribute organic matter that is a source of food and energy for the aquatic ecosystem; provide tree canopy to shade streams and promote desirable aquatic habitat; provide riparian wildlife habitat; furnish scenic value and recreational opportunity; provide opportunities for the protection and restoration of greenspace; and protect raw water sources of potable drinking water for Coweta County citizens. 
                  The SCP district shall overlay other zoning districts so that all lands lying within the SCP district shall also include in other zoning districts. Each parcel of land within the SCP district shall be subject to the provisions, regulations and restrictions of both the SCP district and the other zoning district(s) in which it lies. In the event of other conflict or discrepancy between the requirements of the overlaid SCP district and other underlying district(s), the more stringent requirements shall be observed. 

                  Sec. 210. - Intent. 
                  The intent of this district is to assure that streams in Coweta County will not become polluted and unsuitable as sources of potable water, to establish buffer zones, to minimize land development within the buffer zones along the streams, to require authorization for land development activities, and to comply with the minimum standards set forth by the State of Georgia Rules for Environmental Planning Criteria chapter 391-3-15. 
                  Sec. 211. - Description of district. 
                  The stream corridor protection district shall incorporate these streams in Coweta County, Georgia, which are now and as are determined by the Coweta County Commission to be important. The district shall consist of all streams, as defined by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, excluding perennial streams or perennial stream segments upstream from a public water supply intake, which shall be regulated by article 21B, water supply watershed protection district. The district shall apply to the stream protection area along both sides of a stream. The stream protection area is the buffer zone along each side of a stream as set forth in subsection 214.1, buffer and setback requirements. 
                  Sec. 212. - Limitations on land use. 
                  Within the stream corridor protection district, all minimum standards established by the State of Georgia for protection of watersheds in chapter 391-3-15 of rules of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, Environmental Protection Division, shall apply. Said rules are hereby incorporated into this ordinance by reference. Additionally, this ordinance shall apply to all land development activity on property containing a stream protection area. These requirements are in addition to, and do not replace or supersede, any other applicable buffer requirements established under state law. These requirements do not constitute approval or exemption from buffer requirements established under other applicable local, state, or federal regulations. 
                  Within the SCP area, established by this article and the above-referenced state regulations, uses permitted other than those set out in the above-referenced regulations are as follows:

                  After the effective date of this ordinance, it shall apply to new subdividing and platting activities. 
                  Any land development activity within a buffer established hereunder or any impervious cover within a setback established hereunder is prohibited unless a variance is granted pursuant to article 28 of the zoning and development ordinance. 
                  Editor's note— As originally promulgated, § 212 contained no subsection (d). 
                  Sec. 213. - Additional requirements. 
                  In addition to all requirements set out above, additional requirements shall apply to that portion of the Cedar Creek watershed above the county's designated water intake (more specifically defined according to a plat prepared by Hensley-Schmidt, Inc., and entitled "Stream Corridor Protection Zone") as follows: 
                  1.  Sanitary landfills are not allowed within the drainage basin. 
                  2.  No new wastewater stream discharges allowed. Spray irrigation treated wastewater is not allowed within 2,500 feet of a stream. 
                  3.  The use of chemical fertilizers, pesticides or herbicides is prohibited within 250 feet of a stream. 
                  Sec. 214. - Land development requirements. 
                  214.1.  Buffer and setback requirements. All land development activity subject to this ordinance shall meet the following requirements: 
                  (a)  An undisturbed natural vegetative buffer shall be maintained for 50 feet, measured horizontally, on both banks (as applicable) of the stream as measured from the top of the streambank. A reduction to the 50 feet may be granted should the topography provide for reduced velocities in runoff. This would be calculated by dividing the 50-foot buffer width by the percent of grade of the approach slope and deducting it from the 50 feet. In no case shall the buffer be reduced to less than 25 feet. 
                  (b)  An additional setback shall be maintained for 25 feet, measured horizontally, beyond the undisturbed natural vegetative buffer, in which all impervious cover shall be prohibited. Grading, filling and earthmoving shall be minimized within the setback. 
                  (c)  No septic tanks or septic tank drain fields shall be permitted within the buffer or the setback. 
                  214.2.  Variance procedures. Variances from the above buffer and setback requirements may be granted in accordance with the following provisions: 
                  1.  Where a parcel was platted prior to the effective date of this ordinance, and its shape, topography or other existing physical condition prevents land development consistent with this ordinance, and the planning and zoning or development and engineering department finds and determines that the requirements of this ordinance prohibit the otherwise lawful use of the property by the owner, the board of zoning appeals and board of commissioners of Coweta County (under article 28, zoning and development ordinance) may grant a variance from the buffer and setback requirements hereunder, provided such variance require mitigation measures to offset the effects of any proposed land development on the parcel. 
                  2.  Except as provided above, the board of zoning appeals and board of commissioners of Coweta County shall grant no variance from any provision of this ordinance without first following the criteria for variances under article 28 of the zoning and development ordinance. 
                  Variances will be considered only in the following cases: 
                  a.  When a property's shape, topography or other physical conditions existing at the time of the adoption of this ordinance prevents land development unless a buffer variance is granted. 
                  b.  Unusual circumstances when strict adherence to the minimal buffer requirements in the ordinance would create an extreme hardship. 
                  Variances will not be considered when, following adoption of this ordinance, actions of any property owner of a given property have created conditions of a hardship on that property. 
                  3.  At a minimum, a variance request shall include the following information: 
                  a.  A site map that include locations of all streams, wetland, floodplain boundaries and other natural features, as determined by field survey;

The exact area of the buffer to be affected shall be accurately and clearly indicated; 
                  d.  Documentation of unusual hardship should the buffer be maintained; 
                  e.  At least one alternative plan, which does not include a buffer or setback intrusion, or an explanation of why such a site plan is not possible; 
                  f.  A calculation of the total area and length of the proposed intrusion; 
                  g.  A stormwater management site plan, if applicable; and 
                  h.  Proposed mitigation, if any, for the intrusion. If no mitigation is proposed, the request must include an explanation of why none is being proposed. 
                  4.  The following factors will be considered in determining whether to issue a variance: 
                  a.  The shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property; 
                  b.  The locations of all streams on the property, including along property boundaries; 
                  c.  The location and extent of the proposed buffer or setback intrusion; and 
                  d.  Whether alternative designs are possible which require less intrusion or no intrusion; 
                  e.  The long-term and construction water-quality impacts of the proposed variance; 
                  f.  Whether issuance of the variance is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment.

                  ARTICLE 21A. - CRCP CHATTAHOOCHEE RIVER CORRIDOR PROTECTION DISTRICT 
                  This classification has been established to provide special regulation for development adjacent to the Chattahoochee River and its tributaries in order to provide adequate protection for future water supplies; to reduce siltation and urban runoff which threaten such water supplies; to reduce exposure of life and property to loss by flooding by controlling floodplain development; to reduce over-intensive development which increases the frequency and severity of such flooding adjacent to major streams; to control erosion, flood damage, and pollution; and to protect from contamination the Chattahoochee River, which has been identified, as required, to provide the future drinking water needs of Coweta County citizens. This river corridor is of vital importance to Coweta County and special regulation for the river corridor is required to preserve the qualities that make the river suitable as a habitat for wildlife and a site for recreation, and control flooding, erosion and river sedimentation, and protect the water quality for future needs. 
                  The CRCP district is hereby established and shall overlay all other zoning districts so that all lands lying within the CRCP district shall also be included in other zoning districts. Each parcel of land within the CRCP district shall be subject to the provisions, regulations and restrictions of both the CRCP district and the other zoning district(s) in which it lies. In the event of conflict or discrepancy between the requirements of the overlaid CRCP district and other underlying district(s), the more stringent requirements shall be observed. O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8 (as amended) authorizes the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) to develop minimum planning standards and procedures for the protection of river corridors in the state, and requires local governments to use these minimum standards in developing and implementing local comprehensive plans. 
                  Definitions of special terms used in this article are as follows: 
                  (1)  Buffer means a natural or enhanced vegetated area located adjacent to a protected river and containing flora native to that area. 
                  (2)  Chattahoochee River Protection Plan means that part of the Coweta County Comprehensive Plan, which includes the CRCP district requirements specified herein. 
                  (3)  Hazardous materials means any substance defined as "hazardous material" by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-8-60 et seq. 
                  (4)  Hazardous waste means any solid waste which has been defined as a hazardous waste in regulations promulgated by the administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to the federal act, which are in force and effect on February 1, 1988, codified as 40 CFR section 261.3. (Note: This is the same definition as used in the Georgia Hazardous Waste Management Act.) 
                  (5)  Land disturbing activity means any grading, plowing, scraping, excavating or filling of land; depositing; clearing of vegetation; and any construction, or placement of any structure, impervious surface, dam, obstruction, rebuilding or alteration of a structure. Land disturbing activity shall not include activities such as ordinary maintenance and landscaping operations, individual home gardens, yard and grounds upkeep, repairs, additions or minor modifications to a single-family dwelling, and the cutting of firewood for personal use. 
                  (6)  Land uses existing prior to the promulgation of the CRCP district means any land use or land disturbing activity, including all human endeavors directly associated with such use or activity, which, prior to the promulgation of the CRCP district, falls within one of the following categories: 
                  a.  Is completed; 
                  b.  Is under construction; 
                  c.  Is fully approved by the governing authority; 
                  d.  All materials have been submitted for approval by the governing authority; or 
                  e.  Is zoned for such use and expenditures in excess of $2,500.00 have been made in preparation for construction in accordance with such zoning. 
                  (7)  Local government means the governing authority of a political subdivision. 
                  (8)  Natural vegetative buffer or buffer area means the flora native to the Chattahoochee River Corridor. The natural floras for specific areas are described in Georgia Geologic Survey Bulletin 114, "The Natural Environments of Georgia." Habitats for endangered and threatened species may require human management of the river corridor in order to maintain those species. 
                  (9)  Overlay district means a district that applies supplementary regulations to land previously classified as belonging to a specific zoning district or land use category. 
                  (10)  Protected river means any perennial river or watercourse with an average annual flow of a least 400 cubic feet per second as determined by appropriate U.S. Geological Survey documents. 
                  (11)  Public utility or utilities means a service or services provided by a public company or a private entity which provides such service or services, and all equipment and structures necessary to provide such services.

                  Because stream channels move due to natural processes, the river corridor may shift with time. For the purpose of these standards, the river corridor shall be considered to be fixed at its position at the time of adoption of the Chattahoochee River Corridor Protection district. Any shift in the location after that time will require a revision of the boundaries of the river corridor at the time of comprehensive plan review by the department of community affairs. 
                  (14)  Single-family dwelling means a dwelling structure that is designed for the use of one family. 

                  Sec. 210A. - Intent. 
                  The intent of the regulations contained within this district is to assure that the section of river in Coweta County will not become polluted and unsuitable as a source for potable water, in conjunction with other governmental entities along the Chattahoochee River Corridor, to protect the river corridor in order to establish the natural vegetation buffer area bordering the river, preserve those qualities that make the river suitable as a habitat for wildlife and help control erosion and absorb floodwaters. The further intent is to protect and safeguard the health and welfare of all the citizens of Coweta County by providing protection of the section of river that is or may be used as a source of drinking water. 
                  Sec. 211A. - CRCP district requirements. 
                  I.  Area of river protection. The limits of the Chattahoochee River Corridor Protection District shall incorporate the section of river in Coweta County, inclusive of islands as follows: all residentially zoned areas lying within 500 feet horizontally of the Chattahoochee River, and, all nonresidentially zoned areas lying within 2000 feet horizontally of the Chattahoochee River. 
                  II.  Buffer Zones. A 100-foot undisturbed natural vegetative buffer shall be required for all properties within the CRCP district. The buffer shall be measured horizontally from the uppermost part of the riverbank, usually marked by a break in the slope. Although not within the required 100-foot wide buffer, the area between the top of the bank and the edge of the river shall be included in the CRCP district. In addition, a 35-foot undisturbed natural vegetative buffer shall be required along all tributaries within the CRCP district. 
                  III.  Land disturbance. The CRCP district overlay prohibits any construction within the required 100-foot buffer along the river. All properties lying within the CRCP district shall be subject to the county's erosion and sedimentation control ordinance, which regulates land disturbance through required permitting, plan conformance, turbidity monitoring, and inspection of sites. 
                  IV.  Floodplain standards. In addition, the floodplain restrictions of the flood damage prevention ordinance overlay shall apply to all floodprone areas or properties with alluvial soils, which lie within the CRCP district. The flood damage prevention ordinance overlay prohibits any structures and restricts uses within floodplain areas that would restrict or alter the free flow of floodwaters. 
                  V.  Setbacks. For residentially zoned properties within the CRCP a minimum 150 foot building setback is required from the river, measured horizontally from the uppermost part of the riverbank, usually marked by a break in the slope. The required 100-foot buffer may be included within the setback area. 
                  For nonresidentially zoned properties (with the exception of exempt uses or those established prior to the CRCP district), minimum 500-foot building setback is required from the river, measured horizontally from the uppermost part of the riverbank, usually marked by a break in the slope.

                  ARTICLE 21B. - WATER SUPPLY WATERSHED PROTECTION DISTRICTS 
                  The watershed protection districts shall overlay other zoning districts so that all land lying within the watershed protection districts shall also be included in the underlying district(s). Each parcel of land within the watershed protection district shall be subject to the provisions, regulations, and restrictions of both the watershed protection district and its underlying district(s). In the event of a conflict or discrepancy between the requirements of the watershed protection overlay and the underlying district(s), the more stringent shall apply. 
                  Findings of fact. In order to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within Coweta County and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be assured. The ability of natural systems to filter stormwater runoff can be threatened by unrestricted urban and suburban development. Land disturbing activities associated with development can increase erosion and sedimentation, which threatens the storage capacity of reservoirs. Industrial land uses that involve the manufacture, use transport and storage of hazardous or toxic waste materials result in the potential risk of contamination of nearby drinking water supplies. In addition, stormwater runoff, particularly from impervious surfaces, can introduce toxicants, nutrients and sediment into drinking water supplies, making water treatment more complicated and expensive and rendering water resources unusable. 
                  Purpose. The purpose of the water supply watershed protection district regulation is to establish measures to protect the quality and quantity of the present and future water supply for Coweta County; to minimize the transport of pollutants and sediment to the water supply; and to maintain the yield of the water supply watersheds. 
                  Definitions. Except as specifically described herein, all words in this ordinance shall have their usual and customary meanings. The use of the singular includes the plural and the plural the singular; the present tense includes the future; the use of shall means the action is mandatory, the use of may or should means the action is optional.

                  ARTICLE 21C. - WETLANDS PROTECTION DISTRICT 
                  The wetlands protection district shall overlay other zoning districts so that all land lying within the wetlands protection district shall also be included in the underlying district(s). Each parcel of land within the wetlands protection district shall be subject to the provisions, regulations, and restrictions of both the wetlands protection district and its underlying district(s). In the event of a conflict or discrepancy between the requirements of the wetlands protection overlay and the underlying district(s), the more stringent shall apply. 
                  I.  Findings and purpose. 
                  [A.]  Findings of fact. The wetlands in Coweta County are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion, and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; and open space and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well-being of many communities within the State of Georgia. 
                  Nationally, a considerable number of these important natural resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution and other acts. Piecemeal or cumulative losses will, over time, destroy additional wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare. It is therefore necessary for Coweta County, Georgia, to ensure maximum protection for wetlands by discouraging development activities that may adversely affect wetlands. 
                  [B.]  Purpose. The purpose of this ordinance is to promote wetlands protection, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational and aesthetic values. Activities that may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practicable as determined through a permitting process. The objective of this ordinance is to protect wetlands from alterations that will significantly affect or reduce their primary functions for water quality, floodplain and erosion control, groundwater recharge, aesthetic nature and wildlife habitat. 
                  II.  Definitions. 
                  A.  Wetlands. Those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas. The ecological parameters for designating wetlands include hydric soils, hydrophytic vegetation, and hydrological conditions that involve a temporary or permanent source of water to cause soil saturation. 
                  B.  Generalized wetlands map. The current U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory maps for Coweta County, Georgia. 
                  C.  Jurisdictional wetland. An area that meets the definitional requirements for wetlands as determined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
                  D.  Jurisdictional wetland determination. An official, written statement or map signed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
                  E.  Wetland delineation. The establishment of wetland boundaries by a representative of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers or an authority designated by the Corps. 
                  F.  Regulated activity. Any activity which will, or which may reasonably be expected to, result in the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the U.S. excepting those activities exempted in Section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act. 

                  Sec. 210C. - Establishment of the wetlands protection district. 
                  1.  The wetlands protection district is hereby established which shall correspond to all lands within the jurisdiction of Coweta County, Georgia, that are mapped as wetland areas by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory Maps. This map shall be referred to as the generalized wetlands map and is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this ordinance, together with all explanatory matter thereon and attached thereto. 
                  2.  The generalized wetlands map does not necessarily represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within Coweta County and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of jurisdictional wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this ordinance does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements. 
                  Sec. 211C. - Protection criteria. 
                  No regulated activity will be permitted within the wetlands protection district without written permission or a permit from Coweta County. If the area proposed for development is located within 50 feet of a wetlands protection district boundary, as determined by the county engineer utilizing the generalized wetlands map or performing a field investigation, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required. If the corps determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site, the local permit or permission will not be granted until a Section 404 Permit or Letter of Permission is issued. 
                  Sec. 212C. - Permitted uses. 
                  The following uses shall be allowed as of right within the wetlands protection district to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law, including laws of trespass, and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining, or dredging except as provided herein. 
                  1.  Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish and other wildlife, provided it does not affect waters of Georgia or of the United States in such a way that would require an individual 404 Permit. 
                  2.  Outdoor recreational activities, including fishing, hunting, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding, and canoeing. 
                  3.  Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the Georgia Forestry Commission and as specified in Section 404 of the Clean Water Act.

                  ARTICLE 21D. - GROUNDWATER RECHARGE PROTECTION DISTRICT 
                  The groundwater recharge protection district shall overlay other zoning districts so that all land lying within the groundwater recharge protection district shall also be included in the underlying district(s). Each parcel of land within the groundwater recharge protection district shall be subject to the provisions, regulations, and restrictions of both the groundwater recharge protection district and its underlying district(s). In the event of a conflict or discrepancy between the requirements of the groundwater recharge protection overlay and the underlying district(s), the more stringent shall apply. 
                  I.  Purpose. In order to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within Coweta County and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be ensured. For this reason, it is necessary to protect the subsurface water resources that Coweta County and surrounding communities rely on as sources of public water. 
                  Groundwater resources are contained within underground reservoirs known as aquifers. These aquifers are zones of rock beneath the earth's surface capable of containing or producing water from a well. They occupy vast regions of the subsurface and are replenished by infiltration of surface water runoff in zones of the surface known as groundwater recharge areas. Groundwater is susceptible to contamination when unrestricted development occurs within significant groundwater recharge areas. It is, therefore, necessary to manage land use within groundwater recharge areas in order to ensure that pollution threats are minimized. 
                  II.  Definitions. In addition to the definitions provided elsewhere in this ordinance, the following definitions shall apply: 
                  (1)  Aquifer means any stratum or zone of rock beneath the surface of the earth capable of containing or producing water from a well. 
                  (2)  DRASTIC means the standardized system for evaluating groundwater pollution potential using the hydrologic settings described in U.S. Environmental Protection Agency document EPA-600-2-87-035. (Note: the DRASTIC methodology is the most widely used technique for evaluating pollution susceptibility). 
                  (3)  Hazardous waste means any discarded material which is determined to be a hazardous solid waste under 40 CFR 261.2 by reason of its toxic, caustic, corrosive, abrasive, or otherwise injurious properties that may cause harm to the health of any person handling or otherwise coming into contact with such material or substance. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has developed a list of hazardous wastes based upon corrosivity, reactivity and toxicity. 
                  (4)  Pollution susceptibility means the relative vulnerability of an aquifer to being polluted from spills, discharges, leaks, impoundments, applications of chemicals, injections and other human activities in the recharge area. 
                  (5)  Pollution susceptibility map means the relative vulnerability to pollution prepared by the department of natural resources, using the DRASTIC methodology. (Georgia Department of Natural Resources Hydrologic Atlas 20: Groundwater Pollution Susceptibility Map of Georgia). 
                  (6)  Recharge area means any portion of the earth's surface, where water infiltrates into the ground to replenish an aquifer. 
                  (7)  Significant recharge areas means those areas mapped by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources in Hydrologic Atlas 18 (1989 edition). 

                  Sec. 210D. - Establishment of the groundwater recharge area protection district. 
                  The groundwater recharge area district is hereby established and shall correspond to all lands within the jurisdiction of Coweta County, Georgia, that are mapped as significant recharge areas by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources in Hydrologic Atlas 18, 1989 edition, which shall overlay the Zoning Map of Coweta County and which are shown on the parcel base map entitled "River Corridor, Watershed, and Recharge Map." The protection district shall be established on a parcel by parcel basis so that the whole area of any lot overlain by a significant recharge area or intersected by the boundary of a significant recharge area shall be subject to the protection criteria set forth in section 211D. Said maps and overlay are hereby adopted and made a part of this ordinance. 
                  Determination of pollution susceptibility. Each recharge area shall be determined to have a pollution susceptibility of high, medium, or low based on the Georgia Pollution Susceptibility Map, Hydrologic Atlas 20, 1992 edition. Said map is hereby adopted and made a part of this ordinance. 
                  Sec. 211D. - Protection criteria. 
                  1.  No construction may proceed on a building or mobile home to be served by a septic tank unless the Coweta County Environmental Health Department first approves the proposed septic tank installations as meeting the requirements of the Department of Human Resources Manual for On-site Sewage Management (hereinafter DHR Manual) and items 2, 2A-F and 3, 3A-D below. 
                  2.  Lot size requirements for single-family dwellings including but not limited to manufactured or mobile homes, stick-built homes, modular homes, etc., and individual lots in subdivisions or mobile home lots located in areas other than commercial mobile home parks are set forth in DHR Table MT-1 and paragraphs 2.A-F as follows: 
                  Table MT-1 
                  Minimum lot sizes, minimum lot widths and maximum allowable sewage flow for the type of water supply system. 

                   
                  * In this context "non-public" means an individual water supply system or any other water supply system which is not a "public" water supply system. 
                  ** gpad = gallons per acre per day = gal/acre/day 
                  A.  The above minimum lot sizes are for the typical size home (three or four bedroom) with basic appurtenances such as: driveway, minimum number of trees, and water supply line. If larger homes, swimming pools, tennis courts or outbuildings, etc. are proposed to be constructed or if trees would interfere with installation of an on-site sewage management system, the county board of health will require larger lots to assure useable soil area. 
                  B.  The county board of health may also require larger lot sizes when physical factors indicate the need to do so. These factors include, but are not limited to, the availability of sufficient unobstructed land areas for an approved on-site sewage management system and approved replacement system, slope greater than five percent, percolation rates higher than 45 minutes per inch, need for subsurface drainage or adverse topographic features. 
                  C.  Lots shall be a minimum width of 100 feet or 150 feet measured within the area where an approved on-site sewage management system and approved replacement system are to be located when served by a public water supply system or non-public water supply system, respectively. 
                  D.  The following land areas are not considered as a part of a lot when calculating the required minimum lot size: rights-of-way of roads, easements (such as power line or pipeline) that exclude installation of an on-site sewage management system, bodies of water, land within 50 feet of a lake, river, stream, wetland or other bodies of water and similar limiting factors. 
                  E.  There must be an unobstructed area on each lot for installation of an approved on-site sewage management system and an area equal in size for a conventional system or larger area, as appropriate, for an approved replacement system; this will include sufficient area for necessary site modifications for installation of both the initial system and a replacement system. All pertinent county zoning setbacks and other space requirements must also be met. 
                  F.  The maximum daily sewage flow for each lot or parcel of land shall not exceed 600 gpad when served by non-public or individual water supply system or 1,200 gpad when served by public water supply system. When sewage flows exceed these quantities (600 or 1,200 gpad as indicated) for a given dwelling structure, the minimum lot size or parcel of land shall be increased proportionally. Example: Assume a public water supply exists (so 1,200 gpad maximum sewage flow allowed per minimum required land area of 21,780 square feet), and there is a proposed sewage flow of 5,000 gpd. 
                  To determine X = the square footage of the lot needed, use the following formula: 
                  X = 5,000 gal/day 
                  1,200 gal/acre/day 
                  X = 4.17 acre 
                  X = 4.17 acres × 43,560 ft. 2 /acre 
                  X = 181,500 ft. 2 area of land needed. 
                  Likewise, for a non-public (individual) water supply, to determine Y = the square footage of the lot needed for a proposed sewage flow of 5,000 gpd, use the following formula: 
                  Y = 5,000 gal/day 
                  600 gal/acre/day 
                  Y = 8.33 acres 
                  Y = 8.33 acres × 43,560 ft. 2 /acre 
                  Y = 363,000 ft. 2 area of land needed. 
                  3.  Lot sizing requirements are as follows for multifamily residential dwellings, all other non-single-family dwellings and commercial structures, and this also includes mobile homes located in commercial mobile home parks. Paragraphs 2A through 2F of this ordinance also apply to Table MT-2: 
                  Table MT-2 
                  Minimum lot sizes, minimum lot widths and maximum allowable sewage flow for the type of water supply system. 

                   
                  * In this context "non-public" means an individual water supply system or any other water supply system which is not a "public" water supply system. 
                  ** gpad=gallons per acre per day=gal/acre/day 
                  A.  Subdivisions and individual lots. New homes served by septic tank and absorption field systems shall be on lots having the following minimum size limitations as identified in Table MT-1. 
                  1)  150 percent of the subdivision minimum lot size of Table MT-1 if lot is within a high pollution susceptibility area;

                  C.  If a local government requires a larger lot size than required by [subsection] 3.A. above for homes or [subsection] 3.B. above for mobile homes, the larger lot size shall be used. 
                  D.  Local governments at their option may exempt from the requirements any lot of record prior to the date of adoption of the Rules of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, Environmental Protection Division, Chapter 391-3-16-.02. 
                  4.  New agricultural waste impoundment sites shall be lined if they are within a high pollution susceptibility area; a medium pollution susceptibility area and exceed 15 acre-feet; or a low pollution susceptibility area and exceed 50 acre-feet. As a minimum, the liner shall be constructed of compacted clay having a thickness of one foot and a vertical hydraulic conductivity of less than 5 X 10 -7 cm/sec or other criteria established by the Natural Resource Conservation Service. 
                  5.  New aboveground chemical or petroleum storage tanks, having a minimum volume of 660 gallons, shall have secondary containment for 110 percent of the volume of such tanks or 110 percent of the volume of the largest tank in a cluster of tanks. Such tanks used for agricultural purposes are exempt, provided they comply with all federal requirements. 
                  6.  New facilities that handle hazardous materials of the types listed in section 312 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (excluding underground storage tanks) and in amounts of 10,000 pounds or more on any one day, shall perform their operations on impervious surfaces and in conformance with any applicable federal spill prevention requirements and local fire code requirements. 
                  7.  If article 23, dimensional requirements, requires a larger lot size than that required by Table MT-1 or MT-2, the larger lot size shall be required. 
                  8.  Permanent stormwater infiltration basins shall not be constructed in areas having high pollution susceptibility.

                  ARTICLE 22. - FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION ORDINANCE[3] 

                  Footnotes: 
                  --- (3) --- 
                  Editor's note— Ord. No. 029-15, adopted August 4, 2014, repealed the former Art. 22 §§ 220—228, and enacted a new Art. 22, §§ 220—227, as set out herein. The former Art. 22 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from the Ordinance adopted April 17, 2007 and Ord. No. 028-09, adopted September 1, 2009. 

                  Sec. 220. - Introduction. 
                  It is hereby determined that: 
                  The flood hazard areas of Coweta County are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  Flood hazard areas can serve important stormwater management, water quality, streambank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation and ecological purposes when permanently protected as undisturbed or minimally disturbed areas. 
                  Effective floodplain management and flood hazard protection activities can: (1) Protect human life and health; (2) Minimize damage to private property; (3) Minimize damage to public facilities and infrastructure such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; and (4) Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public. 
                  Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a) have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, Coweta County, Georgia, does ordain the ordinance from which this article derives and establishes this set of floodplain management and flood hazard reduction provisions for the purpose of regulating the use of flood hazard areas. It is determined that the regulation of flood hazard areas and the prevention of flood damage are in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety, as well as to private and public property. 
                  (Ord. No. 029-15, 8-4-15) 
                  Sec. 221. - General provisions. 
                  221.1.  Purpose and intent. The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in flood hazard areas, as well as to protect the beneficial uses of floodplain areas for water quality protection, streambank and stream corridor protection, wetlands preservation, and ecological and environmental protection by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to flooding or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)  Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
                  (4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; 
                  (5)  Limit the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; and 
                  (6)  Protect the stormwater management, water quality, streambank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation, and ecological functions of natural floodplain areas. 
                  221.2.  Applicability. The ordinance from which this article derives shall be applicable to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of Coweta County. 
                  221.3.  Designation of ordinance administrator. The transportation and engineering director or designee is hereby appointed to administer and implement the provisions of this article. 
                  221.4.  Basis for establishing areas of special flood hazard, areas of future-conditions flood hazard and associated floodplain characteristics—Flood area maps and studies. For the purposes of defining and determining "areas of special flood hazard," "areas of future-conditions flood hazard," "areas of shallow flooding," "base flood elevations," "floodplains," "floodways," "future-conditions flood elevations," "future-conditions floodplains," potential flood hazard or risk categories as shown on FIRM maps, and other terms used in this article, the following documents and sources may be used for such purposes and are adopted by reference thereto:

                  (2)  Other studies, which may be relied upon for the establishment of the base flood elevation or delineation of the base or one-percent (100-year) floodplain and flood-prone areas, including: 
                  (a)  Any flood or flood-related study conducted by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the United States Geological Survey or any other local, state or federal agency applicable to Coweta County; and 
                  (b)  Any base flood study conducted by a licensed professional engineer which has been prepared utilizing FEMA approved methodology and approved by Coweta County. 
                  (3)  Other studies, which may be relied upon for the establishment of the future-conditions flood elevation or delineation of the future-conditions floodplain and flood-prone areas, including: 
                  (a)  Any flood or flood-related study conducted by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the United States Geological Survey, or any other local, state or federal agency applicable to Coweta County; and 
                  (b)  Any future-conditions flood study conducted by a licensed professional engineer which has been prepared utilizing FEMA approved methodology approved by Coweta County. 
                  (4)  The repository for public inspection of the FIS, accompanying maps and other supporting data is located at Coweta County Transportation and Engineering Department whose offices are located at 21 East Washington Street, Newnan, Georgia, 30263. 
                  221.5.  Compatibility with other regulations. This article is not intended to modify or repeal any other ordinance, rule, regulation, statute, easement, covenant, deed restriction or other provision of law. The requirements of the ordinance from which this article derives are in addition to the requirements of any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, and where any provision of this article imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, whichever provision is more restrictive or imposes higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall control. 
                  221.6.  Severability. If the provisions of any section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of the ordinance from which this article derives shall be adjudged invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such judgment shall not affect or invalidate the remainder of any section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this article. 
                  221.7.  Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection required by this article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur; flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This article does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This article shall not create liability on the part of Coweta County or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this article or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.

                  Repetitive loss means flood related damage sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds 25 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
                  Site means the parcel of land being developed, or the portion thereof on which the development project is located. 
                  Start of construction includes substantial improvement, and means the date the permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of the structure on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building (including a gas or liquid storage tank), that is principally above ground, or a manufactured home. 
                  Subdivision means the division of a tract or parcel of land resulting in one or more new lots or building sites for the purpose, whether immediately or in the future, of sale, other transfer of ownership or land development, and includes divisions of land resulting from or made in connection with the layout or development of a new street or roadway or a change in an existing street or roadway. 
                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. This term also includes repetitive loss. 
                  Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement to a structure, taking place during a 10-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the improvement. The market value of the building means (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions, which have been identified by the code enforcement official. The term does also not include any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this article. 
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the requirements of this article. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  224.3.  General standards. 
                  (1)  No development shall be allowed within any area of special flood hazard or area of future-conditions flood hazard that could result in any of the following: 
                  (a)  Raising the base flood elevation or future-conditions flood elevation equal to or more than 0.01 foot; 
                  (b)  Reducing the base flood or future-conditions flood storage capacity; 
                  (c)  Changing the flow characteristics as to the depth and velocity of the waters of the base flood or future-conditions flood as they pass both the upstream and the downstream boundaries of the development area; or 
                  (d)  Creating hazardous or erosion-producing velocities, or resulting in excessive sedimentation. 
                  (2)  Any development within any area of special flood hazard or area of future-conditions flood hazard allowed under subsection 224.3(1) shall also meet the following conditions: 
                  (a)  Compensation for storage capacity shall occur between the average ground water table elevation and the base flood elevation for the base flood, and between the average ground water table elevation and the future-condition flood elevation for the future-conditions flood, and lie either within the boundaries of ownership of the property being developed and shall be within the immediate vicinity of the location of the encroachment. Acceptable means of providing required compensation include lowering of natural ground elevations within the floodplain, or lowering of adjoining land areas to create additional floodplain storage. In no case shall any required compensation be provided via bottom storage or by excavating below the elevation of the natural (pre-development) stream channel unless such excavation results from the widening or relocation of the stream channel; 
                  (b)  Cut areas shall be stabilized and graded to a slope of no less than two percent; 
                  (c)  Effective transitions shall be provided such that flow velocities occurring on both upstream and downstream properties are not increased or decreased; 
                  (d)  Verification of no-rise conditions (less than 0.01 foot), flood storage volumes, and flow characteristics shall be provided via a step-backwater analysis meeting the requirements of subsection 224.4; 
                  (e)  Public utilities and facilities, such as water, sanitary sewer, gas, and electrical systems, shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate infiltration or contamination from flood waters; and 
                  (f)  Any significant physical changes to the base flood floodplain shall be submitted as a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) or conditional letter of map amendment (CLOMA), whichever is applicable. The CLOMR submittal shall be subject to approval by Coweta County using the FEMA community concurrence forms before forwarding the submittal package to FEMA for final approval. The responsibility for forwarding the CLOMR to FEMA and for obtaining the CLOMR approval shall be the responsibility of the applicant. Within six months of the completion of development, the applicant shall submit as-built surveys and plans for a final letter of map revision (LOMR). 
                  224.4.  Engineering study requirements for floodplain encroachments. An engineering study is required, as appropriate to the proposed development activities on the site, whenever a development proposes to disturb any land within the future-conditions floodplain, except for a residential single-lot development on streams without established base flood elevations and floodways. This study shall be prepared by a licensed professional engineer and made a part of the application for a permit. This information shall be submitted to and approved by the transportation and engineering director prior to the approval of any permit which would authorize the disturbance of land located within the future-conditions floodplain. Such study shall include: 
                  (1)  Description of the extent to which any watercourse or floodplain will be altered or relocated as a result of the proposed development; 
                  (2)  Step-backwater analysis, using a FEMA-approved methodology approved by the transportation and engineering director. Cross-sections (which may be supplemented by the applicant) and flow information will be obtained whenever available. Computations will be shown duplicating FIS results and will then be rerun with the proposed modifications to determine the new base flood profiles, and future-conditions flood profiles; 
                  (3)  Floodplain storage calculations based on cross-sections (at least one every 100 feet) showing existing and proposed floodplain conditions to show that base flood floodplain and future-conditions floodplain storage capacity would not be diminished by the development; 
                  (4)  The study shall include a preliminary plat, grading plan, or site plan, as appropriate, which shall clearly define all future-conditions floodplain encroachments. 
                  224.5.  Floodway encroachments. Located within areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity flood waters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, floodways must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  (1)  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway, except for activities specifically allowed in [subsection] (2) below. 
                  (2)  Encroachments for bridges, culverts, roadways and utilities within the regulatory floodway may be permitted provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment will not result in any increase to the pre-project base flood elevations, floodway elevations, or floodway widths during the base flood discharge. A licensed professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof; and 
                  (3)  If the applicant proposes to revise the floodway boundaries, no permit authorizing the encroachment into or an alteration of the floodway shall be issued by Coweta County until an affirmative conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) is issued by FEMA or a no-rise certification is approved by Coweta County. 
                  224.6.  Maintenance requirements. The property owner shall be responsible for continuing maintenance as may be needed within an altered or relocated portion of a floodplain on the property so that the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity is maintained. Coweta County may direct the property owner (at no cost to Coweta County) to restore the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity of the floodplain if the owner has not performed maintenance as required by the approved floodplain management plan on file with Coweta County.

                  The following variance and appeals procedures shall apply to an applicant who has been denied a permit for a development activity, or to an owner or developer who has not applied for a permit because it is clear that the proposed development activity would be inconsistent with the provisions of this article. 
                  (1)  Requests for variances from the requirements of this article shall be submitted to the Coweta County Planning and Zoning Department after receiving a denial letter from the director of transportation and engineering. All such requests shall be heard and decided in accordance with procedures set forth under article 28, criteria for variances and conditional uses of the Coweta County Zoning and Development Ordinance. 
                  (2)  Any person adversely affected by any decision of the director of transportation and engineering shall have the right to appeal such decision to the Coweta County Board of Zoning Appeals as established under article 28 of the Coweta County Zoning and Development Ordinance. Pursuant to article 28, the Coweta County Board of Zoning Appeals shall hold a public hearing and make a recommendation to the Coweta County Board of Commissioners. 
                  (3)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Coweta County Board of Commissioners may appeal such decision to the Coweta County Superior Court, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1. 
                  (4)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure, and the variance issued shall be the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (5)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this section are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (6)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (7)  In reviewing such requests, the Coweta County Board of Zoning Appeals and the Coweta County Board of Commissioners shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article. 
                  (8)  Conditions for variances: 
                  (a)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  i.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
                  ii.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  iii.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, or the creation of a nuisance. 
                  (b)  The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore, any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
                  (c)  Any person to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance resulting from the lowest floor elevation being placed below the base flood elevation will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property, and that such costs may be as high as $25.00 for each $100.00 of insurance coverage provided. 
                  (d)  The director of transportation and engineering shall maintain the records of all variance actions, both granted and denied, and report them to the Georgia Department of Natural Resources and the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (9)  Any person requesting a variance shall, from the time of the request until the time the request is acted upon, submit such information and documentation as the Coweta County Board of Commissioners and Coweta Board of Zoning Appeals shall deem necessary for the consideration of the request. 
                  (10)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of the ordinance from which this article derives, the Coweta County Board of Zoning Appeals and the Coweta County Board of Commissioners may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as they deem necessary or appropriate, consistent with the purposes of this article. 
                  (11)  Variances shall not be issued "after the fact."

                  1.  Preparation of preliminary plat and application for approval. The developer shall provide a preliminary plat of the subdivision drawn and sealed by a professional registered engineer, land surveyor, or landscape architect as outlined in section 244.2 of the development regulations. Fifteen copies of the plat, along with the following documents shall be filed in the planning department with the county planner. 
                  a.  A letter requesting review and approval of the preliminary plat, and giving the name and address of a person to whom a copy of the preliminary plat shall be sent after review by the county development review staff. 
                  b.  A soil analysis overlaying the preliminary plat prepared by and bearing the seal of Georgia Department of Human Resources (DHR) certified soil classifier. If roads are involved then DHR certified soil classifier must also be a registered geotechnical engineer in the State of Georgia. The soil analysis must be a comprehensive soil analysis at a minimum DHR level 3 soil survey showing soil classification, predicted and/or measured seasonal high groundwater levels, perched water table, or other restrictive layers such as rock. The report shall also include wetland delineation and any soil features or conditions, which may affect the proper function of subsurface sewage disposal, including absorption rates at specific depths. Six copies shall be submitted carrying the Soil Analysis Certificates printed or stamped thereon. 
                  c.  A letter, email or other correspondence from the United States Postal Service indicating the type of mail delivery that will be available to the proposed development shall be provided. The correspondence should also indicate, either by description or attached drawing, that the proposed location for the cluster mailbox station(s), if applicable, is acceptable to the postal service. 
                  2.  Review of preliminary plat. The planning department will review the documents and forward copies of the preliminary plat to the county development review staff. The review staff will meet as necessary to discuss any problems or corrections necessary before action on the preliminary plat is taken. 
                  3.  Action by the planning department. After receipt of recommendations by the county development review staff, the county planner shall do one of the following: 
                  a.  Issue a certificate of preliminary plat approval. 
                  b.  Issue a certificate of conditional preliminary plat approval subject to any necessary modifications, the nature of which shall be indicated on a copy of the preliminary plat or attached to it in writing, that conditions shall be satisfied on or before the date of final plat approval. 
                  c.  Disapprove the preliminary plat or any portion thereof on the grounds that the proposed subdivision would not meet the requirements of the development regulations, or would create conditions which would be unfavorable to, or adversely affect, the health, safety, convenience, prosperity, or general welfare of the citizens of Coweta County. In such case, the county planner shall notify the applicant in writing of the county's decision. 
                  4.  Time limit for review. All preliminary plats submitted to the planning department for approval which meet the various requirements set forth in these regulations shall be considered by the development review committee not later than 21 working days from the date of receipt of the preliminary plat and its required accompanying documents (excluding weekends and holidays). The applicant for approval may waive this requirement and consent to an extension of time. 
                  5.  Preliminary plat approval binding one year. Approval of the preliminary plat shall be effective and binding upon the county for a period not to exceed one year from the date of approval and shall thereafter expire and be null and void except to the extent that work on the subdivision has progressed, unless a request for an extension of time has been submitted to and is subsequently approved by the county planning department. 
                  6.  What approval of the preliminary plat constitutes. Approval of the preliminary plat is an expression of approval of the layout submitted on the preliminary plat as a guide to the preparation of the construction documents and the final plat, and is not to be considered as approval of the final plat. 
                  7.  Effect on status of dedication. The approval of a preliminary plat by the county shall not be deemed to constitute or affect an acceptance by the county of any street or other ground shown upon the plat. 
                  8.  Improvements authorized. Notwithstanding preliminary approval or conditional preliminary approval, no improvements are authorized before approval of construction plans by the planning department as set forth in section 244.3, construction plans, of the development regulations. Improvements must be installed according to construction plans. Any modifications must be approved by the appropriate department or agency representative authorized to approve such changes. 
                  244.3.2.  Submittal specifications. 
                  1.  The preliminary plat shall be clearly and legibly drawn at a standard engineering scale of not less than 100 feet to one inch. The preliminary plat shall be prepared by a registered professional engineer, landscape architect, or land surveyor, and seal of the certifier shall be shown on the plat. 
                  2.  The proposed name of the subdivision and any required street names shall be submitted to the county planning department, division of development review. 
                  Guidelines for selecting acceptable names are as follows: 
                  a.  Names duplicating or phonetically similar to exiting names will be rejected. Furthermore, street names within the same development cannot be replicated by switching the street type. 
                  b.  Developments choosing locational names that do not have a geographic or historic relationship to the area where the development will occur will be rejected; e.g., a development with the name Brown's Mill must have an approximate location to the Brown's Mill Battlefield Historic Site. 
                  c.  Use road names that do not exceed 15 characters in length (excluding the street type); this is because of sign-space limitation. 
                  d.  Names must be easy to pronounce and should effect a positive connotation. 
                  e.  Double street types are not allowed; e.g., Deer Path Lane. 
                  f.  All street names must have an acceptable type; e.g., Road, Lane, Path. 
                  g.  Punctuation is not allowed; e.g., periods, hyphens, apostrophes. 
                  h.  Directional and numbers are not allowed; e.g., North Star Lane, Four Corners Drive. 
                  i.  Names must use the common historic spelling for a word; e.g., Dakota vs. Dakotah or Senoia vs. Senoya. 
                  j.  Names should be pleasant sounding, appropriate and easy to read so that the public can communicate the name in an emergency situation. 
                  k.  A new road name cannot begin with the name "New" or "Old" if the road name has historically been in use or is found in the Official Street Name Index. 
                  l.  The name of the subdivision should be incorporated into the name of the primary entrance street in a way that is consistent with the other naming criteria listed herein. 
                  A street naming committee, comprised of one representative from the fire department, planning department, GIS, and E-911 will determine whether the name(s) submitted are acceptable. 
                  The development and street name index is maintained by the E-911 office and can provide information on existing names; the index, along with an approved street type list, can be accessed online at http://www.coweta.ga.us . 
                  Approved development and street names must be denoted on all development plans (whether subdivision or site plan) prior to the final plan approval. Only plans reflecting acceptable street names placed on the particular streets they represent will receive approval. 
                  Reserved subdivision/project and street name(s) shall expire two years after submittal. However, once a preliminary plat is approved, names shall remain reserved for the life of the development unless the development is determined abandoned by the street naming committee. A subdivision/project can be declared abandoned because of inactive progress to file a final plat for recording. 
                  3.  The preliminary plat shall contain the following: 
                  a.  Proposed name of subdivision. 
                  b.  Name and address of the owner of record. 
                  c.  Name, address, and telephone number of the developer. 
                  d.  Date of survey, north point and graphic scale, source of datum, date of plat drawing, and space for revision dates.

Sketches may be drawn in freehand and at a scale sufficient to show clearly the information required, but not less than one inch to 2,000 feet. U.S. Geological Survey maps may be used as a reference guide for the location sketch. 
                  h.  Name of former subdivision if any or all of the preliminary plat had been previously subdivided. 
                  i.  Exact boundary lines of the tract indicated by a heavy line giving lengths and bearings. The boundary lines shall include the entire tract to be subdivided eventually and date as required herein shall apply to the entire tract. 
                  In subdivision of over 100 acres, preliminary plat specifications may be modified to exclude information relating to contours and ground elevation, if in the judgment of the county planner, presentation of detailed data relating thereto is not necessary to evaluate the entire subdivision proposal. In such cases, however, a long-range development schedule for the entire development and a preliminary plat in accordance with the specifications for the sections of the subdivision not accepted shall be submitted. It is the intent of this provision that in all cases sufficient information shall be provided for an adequate evaluation of the public service needs in the area. 
                  j.  Ground elevations (USGS datum) on the tract based on field surveys or photogrammetric methods from aerial photographs. The basis for the topographic information shall be shown.

(Drainage easements shall be located along property lines, but such easements shall not be maintained by Coweta County.) 
                  n.  Unit division or stage development, if any, as proposed by the developer. 
                  o.  Provisions for water supply, sewerage and drainage. 
                  p.  Delineation of the building site on each lot, by depicting the minimum required front, side, and rear building setback lines as specified in the county zoning regulations. In addition, the dimensions of all lots shall be shown, plus the total acreage in each lot and the land out of the floodplain in each lot, which must comply with zoning and development ordinance requirements. 
                  q.  Identification of the zoning district classification(s) applicable to the subdivision site as shown on the county's zoning district map. 
                  r.  When new roads are planned, a soil analysis overlaying the preliminary plat prepared by and bearing the seal of an engineer registered in the State of Georgia who is practicing geotechnical engineering. The soil analysis must be a comprehensive soil analysis showing soil classification, predicated and/or measured seasonal high groundwater levels, perched water table, or other restrictive layers such as rock. The report shall also include wetland delineation and any soil features or conditions, which may affect the proper function of subsurface sewage disposal, including absorption rates at specific depths. 
                  Exemption: Any subdivision, where all lots are three acres or larger and no new streets are involved, is exempted from providing a soil analysis. The environmental health department, however, may require soil data on questionable lots to ensure that adequate area be available for an acceptable on-site subsurface sewage disposal system. 
                  4.  Plat certificates. Each preliminary plat submitted to the Planning Department shall carry the following certificates printed or stamped thereon substantially as follows:

                  Sec. 246.5. - Parking and driveways. 
                  See appendix design standards for additional requirements regarding parking configuration/placement. 
                  246.5.1.  Purpose and intent. The purpose and intent of this section is to ensure the provision of off-street parking, loading, queuing and on-site circulation facilities in proportion to the demand created by each use. By requiring such facilities, it is the intent of this section to ensure the provision of functionally adequate, aesthetically pleasing and safe off-street parking, loading, queuing and circulation areas. It is the intent of this regulation to provide standards for the layout and maintenance of display or parking areas, and to provide space for the use of landscape beautification and natural plant growth for developments where off-street parking and open-lot sales, display and service areas are provided. 
                  246.5.2.  General requirements. 
                  1.  Off-street parking, loading, and landscaping. 
                  a.  Applicability. The standards of this section shall apply to all new development or existing development that is modified. 
                  i.  New buildings or a change of use. Off-street parking and loading facilities in accordance with the development regulations shall be provided for any new building constructed and for any new use established or any change in occupancy in an existing building. 
                  ii.  Additions and enlargements with no change of use. Off-street parking and loading facilities in accordance with the development regulations shall be provided for any addition to or enlargement of an existing building, existing use or existing manner of operation that would result in additional parking and loading spaces being required. The additional parking and loading spaces shall be required only in proportionate amount to the extent of the addition, enlargement, or change, not for the entire building. Renovations or additions to vehicular use areas shall provide landscape improvements in accordance with this section. Existing vegetation shall be preserved and incorporated into the landscaping for the vehicular use area. 
                  2.  Off-street parking and loading location and use requirements. 
                  a.  Location of required parking. The intent of this ordinance is to regulate all required off-street parking, except for fee simple developments with common parking. All buildings, structures, and uses of land shall provide, on the same lot with the principal use, off-street parking and loading spaces in an amount sufficient to meet the needs caused by the uses of the land. The location of off-street parking spaces shall not interfere with normal traffic flow or with operation of queuing and backup areas. Loading areas shall not obstruct pedestrian pathways. Each parking space shall be accessible from a driveway and maneuvering and turning areas shall be provided so that no vehicle will be required to back into a public street. 
                  b.  [Adjacent parking.] Adjacent parking lots serving nonresidential or mixed-use buildings shall provide for future interconnectivity. Future interconnectivity provisions for parking lots serving residential development is optional. 
                  c.  Location on other property. If the required automobile parking spaces cannot be reasonably provided on the same lot on which the principal use is conducted, such spaces may be provided on adjacent or nearby property within a similar zoning district, provided a major portion lies within 1,200 feet of the main entrance to the principal use for which such parking is provided per the approval of the county planning department. 
                  d.  Use of required off-street parking areas. Off-street parking spaces shall be provided for the use of residents, customers, patrons, and employees. Required parking spaces shall specifically not be used for the storage, sale or display of goods or materials or for the sale, repair, or servicing of vehicles. All vehicles parked within off-street parking areas shall be registered and operable. Delivery vehicles shall utilize loading areas and not required parking spaces. 
                  i.  Required off-street parking and loading spaces associated with newly erected or altered buildings or newly established uses of land shall be a continuing obligation of the owner of said building or land so long as the structure or use exists or its use requiring vehicle parking or loading facilities continues. In addition, it shall be unlawful for: 1) said owner to discontinue, change or dispense with, or to cause the discontinuance, or change of the required vehicle parking or loading spaces (apart from the discontinuance, sale or transfer of the building or use) without establishing alternative vehicle parking or loading spaces which meet the requirements of and are in compliance with this ordinance, or 2) any person to use a building or lot without providing vehicle parking or loading spaces which meet the requirements of and are in compliance with this ordinance. 
                  ii.  The minimum required dimensions for regular parking spaces, handicapped parking spaces, loading spaces and access/circulation drives are set forth in subsection 246.5.2, item 2 of the development regulations, off-street parking area design and construction standards. 
                  iii.  The maximum number of off-street parking and loading spaces shall be calculated based on the schedule of standards in Table 1 of the development regulations, maximum off-street parking and loading standards. However, in an effort to reduce the amount of impervious area on developed sites, the actual number of parking and loading spaces constructed shall be determined by the owners' engineer. In any event the minimum number of parking spaces provided shall be no less than 50 percent of the maximum number as identified in Table 1. The minimum number of required handicapped parking spaces is presented in Table 2. 
                  iv.  Reduced, shared, or off-site parking for single-family residential districts shall be prohibited. For all other districts, the applicant may request a reduction of parking standards based on the following criteria: 
                  (A)  Reduction of parking requirements through a shared parking arrangement may be permissible only through the permission of the planning department provided the arrangement shall avoid conflicting parking demands and provide for safe pedestrian circulation and access. 
                  (B)  A to-scale map indicating location of proposed parking spaces shall be provided. 
                  (C)  A shared or off-site parking calculation projection shall be provided that demonstrates that each use will have adequate parking provisions at all times. 
                  (D)  For contiguous properties sharing parking spaces under this provision, cross-easements shall be filed establishing access to the parking spaces in perpetuity. 
                  (E)  A reduction in the number of parking spaces that would otherwise be required for each of the various uses on a multiple-use property must be clearly shown on the development plan. If shared or off-site parking is proposed for a combination of contiguous properties, a plan must be submitted covering all of the properties that will be sharing the parking spaces. 
                  (F)  A written agreement among all owners of record shall be provided and held on file with the planning director. 
                  v.  For any use not listed in Table 1, the standards for the most similar use shall be applied. The county engineer shall determine the proper required number of spaces by classifying the use among the uses specified. In making a determination, any evidence of actual parking and loading demands shall be considered as well as other reliable traffic engineering and planning information that is available to ensure sufficient parking and loading spaces are provided to meet the needs caused by the uses of the land. If the number of parking and loading spaces are less than the maximum number calculated in Table 1, the owner shall reserve area on the site which will provide for the installation of additional spaces up to the maximum number. The reserve area shall be accessible from the driveway serving the constructed parking area. In the interim, the reserved parking site shall remain a grassed landscaped area. Based on accident reports, traffic studies, and other information related to the development, the county engineer may require the owner to install additional parking spaces to ensure public safety. If it is deemed by the county engineer that adequate parking has not been provided to serve the particular land use, additional parking shall be installed no later than 90 days from the date of official notice from the county engineer. Enforcement procedures shall be as provided in the Coweta County Zoning and Development Ordinance and the Coweta County Code of Ordinances. The cost for the installation of additional parking and/or associated traffic studies, required by the county engineer, shall be borne by the owner. 
                  vi.  Stormwater quality and quantity requirements of the stormwater management ordinance shall be satisfied for all parking areas. Additional parking spaces, which exceed the maximum number calculated in Table 1, shall be constructed to allow the infiltration of stormwater by utilizing a permeable typical section with a pervious surface course. The pervious typical section and surface shall be designed in accordance with Section 3.3.8 of the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. Striping and/or curbing may be excluded in the overflow parking area upon review and approval by the county engineer. The type of pervious material, conditions of the property, and the type of land use shall be considered in the decision to exclude the striping and/or curbing. 
                  vii.  The maximum designated parking areas, constructed parking areas, and overflow parking areas, if applicable, shall be denoted on the approved predevelopment site plan and the approved final "as-built" as shown in Figure 6. 

                  Figure 6: Denoting Parking Areas on Plans 
                  viii.  Off street parking and loading spaces shall be provided in accordance with the following schedule of standards in Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3.

                  *Note—Shall meet access aisle requirements. 
                  3.  Off-street parking area design and construction standards. 
                  a.  Parking facilities shall be designed and located on the site in a manner that results in minimal visual impact along the street. Location, landscaping, earthwork, and buffering should all be implemented as necessary to reduce the negative visual impacts of parking facilities on the aesthetic quality of the street. 
                  b.  There shall be safe, adequate, and convenient arrangement of pedestrian pathways, bikeways, roads, driveways, and off-street parking and loading spaces within parking areas. Streets, pedestrian walks, parking areas, and open space shall be designed as integral parts of an overall design which shall be properly related to existing and proposed buildings, adjacent uses, and landscaped areas. 
                  c.  Parking facilities shall be maintained in a clean, safe, sanitary and attractive condition. Parking spaces and driving lanes shall be clearly defined and maintained as such. Parking lots shall not be operated when any damage impairs the drivability of the parking lot. 
                  d.  All off-street parking, loading or open-lot sales areas established pursuant to this section shall be designed, constructed and continuously maintained in accordance with the following standards: 
                  i.  Access. Adequate ingress and egress to such areas for vehicles shall be provided by means of clearly limited and defined paved drives. Each parking space shall have appropriate access to a street or an alley. Only dwelling units with no more than two units shall be allowed backward egress from a driveway onto a local street. In all other cases, maneuvering and access aisle area shall be sufficient to permit vehicles to enter and leave the vehicular use area in a forward motion. 
                  ii.  Stacking. Adequate off-street stacking lanes or queuing areas shall be provided for vehicles entering the vehicular use area so as to avoid backup and congestion on adjacent public streets. A minimum queuing distance of 20 feet is required between the property line and the first parking space. 
                  iii.  Parking access aisles. Adequate aisle width in vehicular use areas shall be provided for vehicle bypass and maneuvering areas to ensure efficient on-site circulation. See Table 3 for minimum requirements regarding aisle widths. 
                  iv.  Pedestrian circulation. Structures, vehicular circulation lanes, parking spaces, driveways, and open spaces shall be designed to provide logical, impediment-free pedestrian movement. The site shall be arranged so that pedestrians moving between buildings are not unnecessarily exposed to vehicular traffic. Where off-street parking spaces directly face a structure, and are not separated from the structure by an access aisle, a paved pedestrian walkway shall be provided between the front of the structure and the parking spaces. The walkway shall be a minimum of four feet in width, exclusive of vehicle overhang, and shall be separated from the parking space by concrete wheel-stops or continuous curbing. If the pedestrian walkway adjacent to parking spaces is six feet, six inches wide with continuous curbing, then wheel-stops shall not be required. There shall be a pedestrian walkway a minimum width of four feet connecting ground level parking to the public sidewalks and to all building entrances. This provision shall not apply to residential vehicular use areas. 
                  (A)  Surface parking lots shall include a pedestrian circulation system that provides access from the parking area to the building entrance, major bus stops or other critical access points. The circulation system shall be adequately lit and appropriately signed and marked. Shrub material taller than two feet in height is not recommended along pedestrian walkways within surface parking lots. 
                  v.  Drainage of vehicular use areas. Areas used for display or parking shall be drained so as to eliminate surface water, unless the area or some portion of it is approved as a retention area by the director of development and engineering. Drainage is encouraged in infiltration swales located in the landscaped islands. See section 246.10, stormwater and drainage of the development regulations. The drainage design shall be reviewed and approved by the county engineer prior to the issuance of a permit. 
                  vi.  Paving standards. All parking lots, accessways, storage lots, loading or open lot sales shall be paved and constructed of a minimum of four inches of concrete or two inches of asphaltic concrete on six inches of graded aggregate base (gab), or a base and surface material of equivalent durability as certified by the developer's engineer. Such paved areas shall be maintained in good condition by the owner to prevent any hazards, such as cracked asphalt or potholes. Responsibility for pavement failure occurring as a result of inadequate alternative base and surface material design shall fall on the certifying engineer. The following are exceptions to the above paving standards: 
                  (A)  Storage lots serving facilities within an industrial or light industrial zoning district may be constructed of six inches of graded aggregate at a minimum provided the following requirements are met: 
                  •  The storage area is set back a minimum of 100 feet from a public right-of-way excluding interstate highway rights-of-way. 
                  •  Clearly limited and defined vehicular drives for ingress and egress to the storage area are provided; drive widths shall not exceed 30 feet. 
                  •  A vegetated buffer 20 feet in width and consisting of evergreen plants is installed along the perimeter of the storage lot. The vegetative buffer shall create a visual screen that is 75 percent or more opaque and reaches a height of six feet within two years.

                  2.  Coweta County Streetlight District Procedures. 
                  a.  The object of the Coweta County Street Lighting Program is to illuminate the streets of participating developments in accordance with standards of the American National Standard Practice for Roadway Lighting, 1973. It is not the objective of this program to illuminate private property. 
                  b.  The Coweta County Street Lighting Program will be administered by the county planning department. 
                  c.  There are two power companies servicing Coweta County: Georgia Power Company and Coweta Fayette EMC. Their rates may vary slightly. Georgia Power and Coweta Fayette EMC installs the high pressure "sodium" (14,500 lumen); both companies will utilize existing poles as much as possible. Spacing between lights will vary from 250 feet to 500 feet, or approximately every other utility pole. The cost of the poles, lights, and installation will be worked out between the residents and the utility companies. Verification of the installation charges paid by the community will have to be submitted by letter from the utility company to the planning department. 
                  d.  Property owners within a streetlight district will be billed annually on their county tax bill for the previous year's use of lights. Cost for street lighting will be $48.00 per year, per lot, or $4.00 per month. 
                  e.  The following is a schedule of payments that an applicant must pay initially if the streetlight district is received after January 1, for the first year: 
                  January, per lot\$48.00 
                  February, per lot\$44.00 
                  March, per lot\$40.00 
                  April, per lot\$36.00 
                  May, per lot\$32.00 
                  June, per lot\$28.00 
                  July, per lot\$24.00 
                  August, per lot\$20.00 
                  September, per lot\$16.00 
                  October, per lot\$12.00 
                  November, per lot\$8.00 
                  December, per lot\$4.00 
                  f.  If there are less than 100 percent contributories, the applicant will have to bear the cost of the remaining lots where the petition was disapproved or refused. 
                  3.  Requirements for approval of a streetlight district. In order for a proposed streetlight district to be considered for approval, the following steps are necessary: 
                  a.  Obtain a petition from the Coweta County Planning Department. 
                  b.  All residents and property owners of the proposed district must be contacted and the applicant must submit petitions for each lot; eighty (80) percent participation is required. For those residents not wishing to participate, indication of disapproval or refuse to sign must be noted on their petition. If both husband and wife are joint legal owners, both signatures will be required. The "Mr. and Mrs." signature is not acceptable. Each resident/owner must sign individually. In the event a property owner cannot be personally contacted, the receipt from a registered letter will be accepted. For those residents that rent or lease their home, a copy of the rent or lease agreement must be submitted with their petition. The resident(s) signature on the petition must coincide with the name(s) on the rent or lease agreement. No signatures may be withdrawn from the petition after it is filed with the county planning office. The purpose of the witness's signature is to verify the property owner's/resident's signature, if in question. 
                  c.  The completed petitions shall be returned to the planning department where they will be checked to ensure requirements compliance. Petitions will be returned to the applicant if they do not meet all requirements. Petitions meeting requirements will be presented to the board of commissioners at an official bimonthly meeting for approval or disapproval. 
                  d.  The representative of the group requested approval for a proposed streetlight district and returning petitions to the planning department must also furnish the following: 
                  i.  Three copies of the final plat of the development. These plats may be obtained from the clerk of court office, Coweta County Justice Center, Newnan, Georgia. 
                  ii.  Application fee for a streetlight district. The fee shall be $75.00, plus $5.00 per lot. In addition the first year's payment if the streetlight district request is received after January 1st for the first year. 
                  iii.  A letter from the utility company stating that the installation for the streetlights has been paid for and the number of lights for which the county will receive billing.

                  ARTICLE 25. - BUFFER AREA AND SCREENING REQUIREMENTS 
                  It is recognized that the adjacent location of certain land uses may create an incompatible situation that can be mitigated by the installation of a planted buffer. An incompatible situation can arise due to the location of commercial or industrial uses adjacent to residentially zoned land or to a lesser extent due to location of multifamily residences adjacent to single-family residential districts. 
                  Therefore, when land is to be developed for a use creating an incompatible situation, or when a use deemed incompatible is modified or expanded, a buffer shall be provided along all side and rear property lines to insulate adjacent properties from adverse impacts. The required buffer shall provide necessary visual privacy for the conduct of residential lifestyles in an undisturbed environment, and shall provide for the protection and preservation of property values in residential districts. 

                  Sec. 250. - Situations requiring buffers. 
                  The following situations constitute creation of incompatibilities and are subject to the buffer requirements of this ordinance: 
                  (1)  The location of commercial or industrial land use directly adjacent to residentially zoned land. 
                  (2)  The location of manufactured home parks or multifamily developments directly adjacent to land zoned for single-family residences. 
                  The board of commissioners may require a buffer between other districts or land uses when it is determined that an incompatible situation exists or may occur as a result of a development activity. 
                  Sec. 251. - General requirements. 
                  Buffers shall be established and maintained by the owner of the property containing the incompatible land use. The determination of incompatibility shall be based upon the existing character of the area in which the proposed action takes place. For example, proposed development or modification of commercial or industrial land use adjacent to an area developed as residential shall require the owner of the commercial or industrial property to install and maintain the buffer. If however, nonresidentially zoned land is rezoned for development of residences and this property is located adjacent to land developed as, or zoned for, nonresidential use, the owner of the property to be rezoned for residences shall be required to install and maintain the buffer. 
                  The requirements for buffers are as follows: 
                  (1)  Where commercial or industrial land uses are contiguous with land zoned for single-family residential use, the minimum width shall be as follows: 

                   
                  (2)  Where commercial or industrial land uses are contiguous with land zoned for manufactured home parks, or multifamily residences, the minimum width of the required buffer shall be 25 feet. 
                  (3)  Where manufactured home parks, or multifamily land uses, are contiguous with land zoned for single-family residences, the minimum width of the required buffer shall be 50 feet. 
                  (4)  The minimum width of the required buffer for sanitary landfills shall be 500 feet. 
                  In all other instances, the minimum width of a buffer as required by the board of commissioners shall not be less than 25 feet. Vegetation attaining a minimum height in excess of that required herein might be required to mitigate the impacts of certain projects. 
                  The required buffer can be incorporated into the yard setback as specified in the appropriate zoning district. Also, drainfield lines for septic systems are allowed within required buffer areas that are 50 feet or greater in width, provided those drainfield lines are set back as follows: 
                  Setback 25 feet when a 50-foot buffer width is required. 
                  Setback 35 feet when a 75-foot buffer width is required. 
                  Setback 50 feet when a 100-foot or greater buffer width is required. 
                  All setbacks are measured from the nearest single-family residential zoning district line. 
                  Where a buffer is required, the planning director or his designee shall evaluate the existing vegetative and topographic conditions, development, and zoning to make a determination as to whether a natural buffer or planted buffer is to be required. If the planning director or his designee determines that the existing vegetation in the area where the buffer is required is of sufficient height, density, and width as to accomplish the aforementioned purpose of the buffer and substantially comply with the buffer specifications stated herein, then the planning director or his designee may require a natural buffer. However, if the planning director or his designee determines that the existing or natural vegetation is not sufficient, then a planted buffer (possibly including [a] fence, earth berm or similar such barrier) may be required. 
                  Once the developer/property owner has staked the natural buffer or, in the case of the planted buffer, installed the buffer and the planning department has approved the buffer, then this buffer is to be considered to be an undisturbed buffer. Minor maintenance or development activity (such as a drainage easement, sewer line connection, etc.) may be authorized by the planning director or his designee upon request. 
                  No area in which a buffer is required by this ordinance shall be disturbed without first obtaining approval from the planning department. 
                  (Ord. No. 035-08, 11-18-08) 
                  Sec. 252. - Minimum specifications. 
                  The following are minimum specifications for required buffers. All required buffers shall: 
                  (1)  Be depicted in detail (the type and location of natural and planted vegetation are to be illustrated) on each site plan or plat prior to approval, and shall be designated as a permanent buffer. 
                  (2)  Not be disturbed by grading, property improvements or construction activities except where necessary to prevent a nuisance, or to thin such natural growth, where too dense to permit normal growth, or to remove diseased, misshapen, or dangerous and decayed timbers. Any contemplated disturbance shall first be brought to the attention of the planning director or his designee and formal approval secured prior to initiating activity within required buffer areas. 
                  (3)  Utilize existing vegetation in an undisturbed state where it has been determined that existing vegetation is appropriate for inclusion within the buffer strip, or when required be supplemented with approved, additional planting. 
                  (4)  Retain the natural topography of the land, except when a portion must be cleared and graded as required by the local law to prevent soil erosion or sedimentation. 
                  (5)  Be completely installed in accordance with the approved plan prior to issuance of the certificate of occupancy. 
                  (6)  Not be used for temporary or permanent parking or loading, other than for provision of drainage improvements as mandated by local law, or for a structure other than a fence. 
                  (7)  [Reserved.] 
                  (8)  Be subject to plan approval by the planning director or his designee prior to installation of a planted buffer. 
                  (9)  All planted buffers shall be comprised of a minimum of three genera of approved plant material. If three genera of plant material are to be utilized within the buffer, then each genus shall be provided in as close to equal quantities as possible. If more than three genera of plant material are to be utilized within the buffer, then no genus shall comprise more than 33% of the total number of plants within the buffer. 
                  (Ord. No. 035-08, 11-18-08) 
                  Sec. 253. - Buffer composition. 
                  The following table indicates plant materials which may be used in buffers: 

                   
                  Additional plants may be approved for use in buffers by submitting a letter to the planning director. Plants shall be approved based on their growth rates and habits, form, and hardiness within the planting zone. Generally faster growing plants with dense, evergreen foliage shall be preferred. 
                  (Ord. No. 035-08, 11-18-08) 
                  Sec. 254. - Maintenance of required buffers. 
                  The buffers required under the provisions of the [this] article shall be guaranteed for the duration of the incompatible land use, or until such use changes to a compatible type. Necessary trimming and maintenance shall be performed to maintain the health of the plant materials, to provide a natural pleasing appearance, and to assure that the buffer serves the purpose for which it was intended. 
                  Sec. 255. - Required screening. 
                  Certain uses such as junkyards and salvage yard operations and other commercial and industrial operations requiring the storage of inoperative equipment or vehicles for prolonged periods of time could present unsightly views or health hazards. To preclude this from occurring, the planning director shall require owners of such properties to completely enclose such operations by a fence which completely obscures views of the property from adjacent properties, built to a height greater than that of the height of the highest piece of equipment or vehicle stored on the property provided that no fence shall be less than six feet in height, but in no case less than such height as will screen all junk or other materials or vehicles from view and provided that such fence be at least 40 feet from any street right-of-way or any zone district boundary line. Many operations which involve the stacking of inoperative or obsolete equipment or vehicles pose a direct health hazard to the public. The county commission shall require all such operations to submit to annual inspection by the Coweta County health department. The results of such inspections shall be delivered to the county commission for review. If a business fails to pass such inspection it shall have 30 days to comply or it shall cease operations until such time that compliance is effected. 
                  (Ord. No. 035-08, 11-18-08) 
                  Sec. 256. - Screening barriers. 
                  In those instances when extraordinary or exceptional conditions pertaining to the property exist, resulting from its size, shape, topography or other features, screening barriers such as walls or fences may be allowed in place of a 50-foot buffer upon approval as set forth in article 28 and provided the following standards are met: 
                  (1)  Walls or fences shall be ornamental or decorative and constructed of brick, stone, treated wood, stucco or other materials approved by the planning director and shall not be constructed of exposed concrete block, tires, junk or other discarded materials. [The] wall or fence shall provide an opaque screen of at least six feet in height or as specified by the board of zoning appeals. 
                  (2)  If a wall or fence is designed so that its structural supports are primarily on one side, that side must always remain within the interior of the property. 
                  (3)  No wall or fence shall be installed within any public right-of-way. 
                  (4)  Any wall or fence damaged by accident or an act of God shall be properly repaired within 90 days of occurrence. 
                  (5)  It shall be the responsibility of the owner of the property on which a wall or fence is located to maintain that wall or fence in good and proper repair so that it presents a neat and orderly appearance at all times to surrounding property owners and to the general public. 
                  (6)  If a property owner does not take appropriate action to maintain or repair a damaged screening barrier within 90 days after receiving a notice to comply, the county shall take any action provided by law, including the issuance of a citation, to promptly and properly correct the violation.

                  • Timber harvesting and other agricultural/horticultural practices. 

                  Sec. 250A. - Purpose. 
                  This tree preservation ordinance has been developed to benefit the environmental and aesthetic quality of Coweta County. The intent is to create an opportunity and promote preservation of the county's natural resources and grow in a way that will provide a healthy environment for Coweta's future. The purpose of this tree preservation ordinance is to provide standards for the preservation of trees as part of the land development process; to prevent massive grading of land, both developed and undeveloped, without provision for replacement of trees; and to protect trees during construction whenever possible in order to enhance the quality of life within Coweta County. The regulations of this tree preservation ordinance shall be the definitive, unless otherwise directed by the zoning and development ordinance or county code. The benefits derived from this tree preservation ordinance include: 
                  1.  Provide visual buffering and enhance beautification of the county; 
                  2.  Moderation of stormwater runoff, and improved water quality; 
                  3.  Protect and attempt to enhance property values, thus safeguarding private and public investment; 
                  4.  Protect the unique identity of Coweta by promoting native plants; 
                  5.  Control soil erosion; 
                  6.  Reduction of some air pollutants and interception of airborne particulate matter; 
                  7.  Preserve stands of trees and "specimen" trees; and 
                  8.  Protect natural vegetation except where its removal is necessary for responsible property development or control of disease and infestation. This article shall serve to dissuade the unnecessary clearing of land and its disturbance, so as to preserve, insofar as possible, the natural and existing growth of vegetation, and to replace whenever possible the removed foliage with new vegetation.

                  Sec. 252A. - Applicability, permitting, and procedures. 
                  1.  Applicability. 
                  a.  The terms and provisions of this tree preservation ordinance shall apply to all activity which requires the issuance of a land disturbance permit on any real property within Coweta County, unless otherwise exempted below. No clearing, grubbing, grading, or other removal of existing vegetation that may affect the health of existing tree coverage may occur until it is determined that the proposed development is in conformance with the provisions of this tree preservation ordinance. Table 1, summary of applicability and exemptions, summarizes those activities which are exempt from the provisions of this tree preservation ordinance and those for which a tree protection plan must be submitted with the preliminary plat, construction plan, or predevelopment site plan and be approved prior to the issuance of a land disturbance permit (LDP) or building permit. 
                  Table 1: Summary of Applicability and Exemptions 

                   
                  b.  The county arborist/landscape architect, as part of the review team, will conduct a preliminary review of all rezoning cases and special use permit applications. Conditions to rezoning will be applied where determined necessary by the preliminary review. These conditions may be either general, or specific in nature, and will reflect the standards or provisions of this tree preservation ordinance and the zoning and development ordinance. Compliance to these conditions will be verified by review of a revised site plan prior to the issuance of a land disturbance permit. 
                  c.  Developers and design professionals may meet at any time with the county arborist/landscape architect to discuss the tree preservation planning process. The county arborist/landscape architect is available for field inspections of site conditions prior to submittal to assist in the design process as it relates to preserving trees. Information can also be disseminated about how to prepare a tree protection plan for submittal in order to minimize plan review time. 
                  2.  Permitting process. 
                  a.  Prior to the submission of any permit drawings, the applicant is encouraged to meet with the county arborist/landscape architect to discuss the tree preservation ordinance as it relates to the applicant's property. The purpose of the presubmittal conference is to clarify the provisions and procedures of the tree preservation ordinance and review applicable standards and guidelines for the submittal of documents, and required tree protection, replacement, and maintenance measures. 
                  b.  Tree protection plan, six copies, either as separate or combined drawings, along with other permit drawings, are to be submitted as part of the plan approval and/or land disturbance permit process to the Coweta County Planning Department. These plans will be reviewed by the county arborist/landscape architect for compliance with the zoning and development ordinance of Coweta County and this tree preservation ordinance in particular and either approved, denied, or returned for revisions. Any comments will be made available to the designer for response or revision to the drawings. The plans shall then be resubmitted (along with previous red line comments), with the necessary changes, following the same procedure as if it were an original application. Issuance of a land disturbance permit is contingent upon approval of the tree protection plan. 
                  3.  Procedures. 
                  a.  All tree protection measures shall be installed prior to any land disturbance, and the county arborist/landscape architect shall be contacted for a preconstruction conference prior to any land disturbance. To adequately protect the site, tree save areas shall be delineated in the field with tree protection fencing. Land disturbance may proceed only after a permit is obtained and tree protection measures have been installed and approved by the county arborist/landscape architect. The county arborist/landscape architect will conduct unscheduled inspections during construction to ensure compliance with the approved tree protection plan. The county arborist/landscape architect shall have the authority to stop work on a development if site activities do not comply with the approved tree protection plan and/or this tree preservation ordinance. 
                  b.  If tree removal does not occur with and is not processed in conjunction with a current land disturbance permit or building permit application, then a separate tree removal permit shall be required for nonresidential properties. A tree removal permit is required to remove any tree, which was required at the time a site was developed, from any nonresidential property. There will be a fee for obtaining a tree removal permit based on the number of staff hours necessary for the review (see appendix, fee schedule). For trees removed with an approved tree removal permit, the trees shall be replaced on an inch-per-inch basis such that the total caliper inches of the new trees planted is equal to the inches of the tree(s) removed. However, if any required trees are removed from any property without a tree removal permit, land disturbance permit, or building permit, the property owner shall replace the tree(s) at a rate of two times the inches of the existing tree. For sites which were developed after the adoption of the tree preservation ordinance, the minimum required caliper inches per acre must be maintained at all times. Failure to maintain the required number of caliper inches per acre shall result in replantings or payment to the tree fund, where appropriate. 
                  c.  Any specimen tree which is removed without appropriate review and approval of the county arborist/landscape architect will be replaced by trees equaling a two times an inch-for-inch replacement of the tree removed. The owner of the property shall be required to replace said tree or trees with replacement trees which will be three-inch minimum caliper. Size alone will determine whether a tree was of specimen quality if the tree is removed without approval and there is no evidence of its condition. Such action may also result in a stop work order issued by the county arborist/landscape architect. 
                  d.  An approved tree protection plan must be implemented prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. When the developer/owner has installed the required landscaping improvements, he shall request an inspection by the county arborist/landscape architect. If the county arborist/landscape architect approves the installation, the developer will then post a two-year landscape establishment bond. The landscape establishment bond shall be in the amount of the contract award for landscaping or in an amount determined by the county arborist/landscape architect, whichever is higher. After the landscape establishment bond has been received, the project will then be released for the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. If the county arborist/landscape architect does not approve the plan, he shall submit a report stating his reasons for disapproval so that the developer can make the necessary corrections. After the corrections have been made, a reinspection shall be requested. 
                  e.  At the end of the two-year landscape establishment period, the county arborist/landscape architect shall inspect the site and shall make a determination of whether or not the required trees and landscaping are healthy and have a reasonable chance of surviving to maturity. Upon such finding, the bond shall be released. In absence of such finding, the bond shall not be released and the owner of the property shall be notified to replace the unhealthy trees and landscaping or take other appropriate action as approved by the county arborist/landscape architect. Upon failure of the owner to comply with the county arborist/landscape architect's decision regarding such trees, the county shall use the bond to the extent necessary to bring the property into compliance. Final inspection shall be scheduled within ten working days' notice. 
                  f.  It shall be the duty of the county arborist/landscape architect to enforce the provisions and requirements of this tree preservation ordinance. The county planning director shall have the authority to revoke, suspend, or void any land disturbance permit and shall have the authority to suspend all work on a site or a portion thereof. 
                  g.  Land clearing for agricultural purposes, including timber harvesting; plant or tree nurseries; orchards, is exempt. All timber harvesting shall be in accordance with the following standards and requirements: 
                  i.  Undisturbed stream buffers shall be maintained and protected during the land disturbance activity. 
                  ii.  Timber harvesting practices shall follow the recommended best management practices as established by the Georgia Forestry Commission. 
                  (Ord. No. 026-09, 8-18-09; Ord. No. 003-12, 2-7-12) 
                  Sec. 253A. - Tree preservation and protection. 
                  The trees in Coweta are a county resource worth protecting and maintaining. Existing trees shall not be disturbed, except as outlined in this tree preservation ordinance. Any large, rare, or historically significant trees on a project site shall be highlighted by the designer (see specimen trees, section 253A.6.). It is required that all reasonable efforts be made to save specimen trees. (Reasonable effort shall include, but not [be] limited to, alteration of building design, alternate building location, parking area, detention area, drainage system, or relocation of utilities). Careful thought and consideration is expected to be given to saving trees in the development process. 
                  In the plan review process of a proposed project, the first indicator of how well trees have been incorporated in the design process is how the proposed development will impact specimen trees. These trees are considered on an individual basis and a proposal to remove any of them is carefully scrutinized. Another indicator is how the proposed development will impact smaller, significant trees. These trees are typically considered in mass as they relate to the overall preservation of the natural character of the site. Removals which are not adequately justified may require site plan alterations. 
                  The following guidelines and standards shall apply to trees proposed to be retained for credit toward meeting the caliper inch requirement on a property: 
                  1.  Planning considerations. Tree space is the most critical factor in tree protection throughout the site development process. The root system can easily extend beyond the drip line of the tree canopy. The root system within the drip line region is generally considered to be the critical root zone. Disturbance within this zone can directly affect a tree's chances for survival. To protect these critical root zones the following planning considerations should be applied: 
                  a.  The use of tree save islands and stands is encouraged rather than the protection of individual (nonspecimen) trees scattered throughout a site. This will facilitate ease in overall organization as related to tree protection. 
                  b.  The protective zone of specimen trees or stands of trees or otherwise designated tree save areas shall include no less than the total area beneath the tree(s) canopy as defined by the furthest canopy drip line of the tree(s). 
                  c.  Tree preservation and grading requirements are two design constraints, which are most often in conflict. A grade change of a few inches can be detrimental to a tree, yet most sites require extensive cut and fill in order to manage drainage. The use of berms or retaining walls, instead of cutting, to provide detention can be used to preserve significant trees. Detention ponds can be designed around significant trees by adding depth to minimize width where possible. Retaining walls can also be used to mitigate cuts and fills. Tree wells and/or aeration systems can also be provided for trees in areas of fill. 
                  d.  Underground water and wastewater lines, storm sewers, irrigation lines and both underground and overhead electric and telephone lines can have a considerable impact on trees. The layout of the project site utility plans should accommodate the required tree protective zones. Utilities should be placed along corridors between tree protective zones. Developers shall coordinate the location of utility lines, including irrigation and electric lighting, with the utility companies in order to prevent root damage within the critical root zones of protected trees and to minimize damage to trees located in protected zones. 
                  e.  Construction activities, such as parking, material storage, concrete washout, or burn hole placement, shall be arranged so as to prevent disturbances within tree protective zones. No disturbance shall occur within the protective zone of specimen trees or stands of trees without prior approval of the county arborist/landscape architect. 
                  f.  Sidewalks often appear harmless on plans, but can be very detrimental to trees due to grading requirements. Considerations should be given to move sidewalks as far from tree trunks as possible and provide a finished grade above the existing grade for sidewalks required in close proximity to a tree trunk. Drainage can be routed under sidewalks where an elevated grade is required. 
                  2.  Protection of existing trees. 
                  a.  Tree protection devices are necessary to eliminate activities detrimental to trees, including, but not limited to: 
                  i.  Soil compaction in the critical root zone resulting from heavy equipment, vehicular or excessive pedestrian traffic, or storage of equipment or materials; 
                  ii.  Root disturbance due to cuts, fills, or trenching; 
                  iii.  Wounds to exposed roots, trunks, or limbs by mechanical equipment; 
                  iv.  Other activities such as chemical storage, cement truck cleaning, or fire. 
                  b.  Trees identified to be preserved and counted as credit towards meeting caliper inch requirements shall have a four-foot height tree protection fencing installed at the critical root zones/drip line. For methods of tree protection, see subsection 253A.3.a.—g. All tree protection measures shall be installed prior to the start of any land disturbance and maintained until final landscaping is installed. No construction activities are to occur within tree protection areas. Areas designated for parking, materials and equipment storage or staging areas are to be located outside of the drip line of existing trees. 
                  c.  The county arborist/landscape architect will conduct periodic inspections of the site before work begins and during clearing, construction, and post-construction phases of development in order to ensure compliance with these regulations and the intent of this tree preservation ordinance. Tree protection must remain in functioning condition throughout all phases of development. Failure to comply with and/or maintain approved tree protection measures may result in a stop work order issued by the planning director. 
                  d.  Damage to trees on county property and construction sites. Damages to specimen trees on county property and construction sites shall be evaluated under the tree hazard evaluation form of the International Society of Arboriculture by the county arborist. Said damage shall be classified under the hazard rating scale and shall be subject to the following fees and recompense: 
                  Hazard Rating Score 1—7 
                  Evaluation fee: $150.00 
                  Repairs done according to tree corrective procedure 
                  Delay of corrective action: $150.00 per tree per day 
                  Hazard Rating Score 8—12 
                  Evaluation fee: $150.00 
                  Replacement fee: $500.00 + $50.00 inch-per-inch recompense 
                  Delay of corrective action: $150.00 per tree per day 
                  When damage occurs, the county arborist shall be contacted immediately by the property developer/contactor in order to evaluate damages and recommend corrective procedures. The county arborist shall be contacted before and after any repairs have taken place to ensure that the proper procedures have been followed. Failure to comply with the provisions of this paragraph may result in a stop work order and/or additional fines. 
                  3.  Methods of tree protection. The root system within the drip line is generally considered to be the critical root zone. Most trees can tolerate only a small percentage of critical root zone loss. To protect these critical root zones, a tree protection area shall be established around each tree or group of trees to be retained. The following section describes ways to help control unnecessary encroachment on existing trees. These methods and guidelines will be followed for tree protection throughout all phases of construction. These guidelines are designed to reduce damage to critical root zones and wounds to exposed roots, trunks, and limbs by chemical, mechanical, and other means. Tree protection areas will be delineated on tree protection plan and methods of protection will be clearly noted and detailed. 
                  a.  Active protective barriers. Barriers shall be installed along the outer edge of and completely around the critical root zones of all specimen trees or stands of trees, or otherwise designated tree protective zones, prior to any land disturbance. Deviations from this must be approved on an individual basis by the county arborist/landscape architect. Barriers will be a minimum four feet high. Use of any one of the following three options is acceptable: 
                  OPTION ONE: A post and rail configuration using a two-inch by four-inch post and a one-inch by four-inch rail, with the post no further than six feet apart (recommended); 
                  OPTION TWO: Chain-link fence with the same post spacing; 
                  OPTION THREE: Orange safety or visual barrier fence securely attached to hog wire and mounted on steel posts, same post spacing. 
                  All tree protection zones should be designated as such with "tree save area" signs posted visibly on all sides of the fenced-in area. All tree fencing shall be maintained throughout the land disturbance and building construction, and should not be removed until all construction and landscaping is complete. 
                  b.  Passive protective barriers. Tree save areas and their critical root zones not within 60 feet of any grading, storage, construction or traffic areas may be protected by four-foot orange laminated plastic safety fencing. Passive tree protection fencing is to be used only for areas remote from construction activity. 
                  c.  Boring. No open trenching will be allowed within the protected zone as defined by the protective barricades. All underground utilities to be installed within this protection zone shall be installed by boring underneath the root zone. Any exceptions must be approved by the county arborist/landscape architect. 
                  d.  Filling/clearing within root zone. Fill dirt no deeper than two inches may be allowed within the drip line of the tree. No grubbing is permitted in the root zone. In the protected root zone, any stumps, dead trees and shrub growth to be removed shall be cut flush or ground out. Stump grinding will be accomplished with equipment and methods acceptable in normal arboriculture operations. All holes will be backfilled completely the same day of the operation. 
                  e.  Soil compaction. Where compaction might occur due to traffic or materials storage, the tree protection zone must first be mulched with a minimum four-inch layer of shredded hardwood mulch, or a six-inch layer of pine straw. 
                  f.  Clearing activities. Roots often fuse and tangle amongst trees. The removal of trees adjacent to tree save areas can cause inadvertent damage to the protected trees. Wherever possible, it is advisable to cut minimum two-foot trenches (e.g., with a Ditch Witch) along the limits of land disturbance, so as to cut, rather than tear, the roots. Trenching may be required for the protection of specimen trees. The cutting down and then grinding the stump of the adjacent removed trees, as opposed to bulldozing them and ripping their roots, can also aid the protected trees. 
                  g.  Tree removal. To minimize potential root loss from soil disturbance in an overlapping root situation, all roots attached to a tree inside a tree save area that extend outside the tree save areas shall be cut by hand if the soil is to be disturbed. The removal of any tree adjacent to a tree within a tree save area shall not be removed by heavy equipment. Cutting the roots by hand, with a stump grinder, or with a Ditch Witch is acceptable. 
                  4.  Tree protection plan. Any proposal for development or improvement of any tract of land shall include a tree protection plan, including trees to be planted in order to meet the minimum requirements of this section, except as provided in section 253A(6)(e) of this tree preservation ordinance. Such plan shall be submitted, along with other permit drawings, to the Coweta County Planning Department prior to any clearing, grubbing, grading or other removal of the existing vegetation that may affect the health of existing tree coverage. No tree removal shall occur prior to approval of the tree protection plan. The tree protection plan may be submitted as part of the landscape plan, provided that all required information is legible, or as a separate drawing which includes, as a minimum, the following: 
                  a.  Name, address, and phone number of owner of record and applicant.

Existing trees or stands of trees used in the caliper inch calculation must be clearly indicated on the drawing. A summary table of the number of existing trees to remain and new trees to be planted, by diameter, shall be shown along with the summary total for the site. 
                  o.  Additional information as required on a case-by-case basis. This could include, but is not limited to, a certified arborist's appraisal of the tree's viability and projected life span. 
                  p.  The following notes shall be indicated on both the tree protection plan and the grading plan in large bold letters: 
                  i.  CONTACT THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT AT (770) 254-2635 TO ARRANGE A PRE-CONSTRUCTION CONFERENCE WITH THE COUNTY ARBORIST/LANDSCAPE ARCHITECT PRIOR TO ANY LAND DISTURBANCE. 
                  ii.  ALL TREE PROTECTION MEASURES SHALL BE INSTALLED AND INSPECTED PRIOR TO THE START OF ANY LAND DISTURBANCE AND MAINTAINED UNTIL FINAL LANDSCAPING IS INSTALLED. CALL THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT AT (770) 254-2635 FOR AN INSPECTION BY THE COUNTY ARBORIST/LANDSCAPE ARCHITECT. 
                  iii.  NO PARKING, STORAGE, OR ANY OTHER CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES ARE TO OCCUR WITHIN TREE PROTECTION AREAS. 
                  iv.  A MAINTENANCE INSPECTION OF TREES WILL BE PERFORMED AFTER TWO FULL GROWING SEASONS FROM THE DATE OF THE FINAL CONSTRUCTION INSPECTION. PROJECT OWNERS AT THE TIME OF THE MAINTENANCE INSPECTION ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR TREE PRESERVATION ORDINANCE COMPLIANCE. 
                  5.  Determination of caliper inch requirements. 
                  a.  Single-family residential development required to provide open space shall retain 50 percent of all trees located in the required open space area of the development; and shall maintain or exceed 12 caliper inches per lot in the front yard of all residential lots. Existing deciduous trees on the lot may be preserved to meet the 12-inch requirement per lot. The minimum size for new trees used to meet this requirement shall be three caliper inches; and the trees must be deciduous. All newly planted trees used to meet this requirement must be planted in the front yards, except in the RRCC zoning district and the RCSD-B and ECP-B development types, where the caliper inches may be met anywhere on the lot. Prior to request for a certificate of occupancy, the trees used in meeting this requirement must be clearly identified in the field with flagging. 
                  b.  Single-family residential development wherein the lot sizes are 1.6 acres or larger, and wherein there is no requirement for common open space, shall not be subject to this tree preservation ordinance. 
                  c.  Reserved. 
                  d.  Property developed under a conditional use permit with an underlying residential zoning shall maintain or exceed 30 caliper inches per acre, which shall be calculated only on the disturbed acreage. 
                  e.  Multifamily residential and nonresidential development shall maintain or exceed 50 caliper inches per acre. 
                  f.  The caliper inch requirements may be achieved by totaling existing trees (DBH) to be preserved, planting new trees in accordance with the minimum standards of this tree preservation ordinance, or some combination of the two. All trees that are to be counted toward meeting caliper inch requirements must be inventoried. The minimum caliper inch requirement per acre must be met whether or not a site had trees prior to development. The caliper inch per acre requirement shall be prorated for any portion which is less than a full acre. Meeting the caliper inch requirement contained in this tree preservation ordinance does not relieve the applicant from meeting the landscaping and buffer requirements contained in other provisions of the Coweta County Zoning and Development Ordinance. With the prior approval of the county arborist/landscape architect, sampling methods may be used to determine caliper inches (DBH) for forested areas. Sampling method shall be a recognized sampling technique performed and certified by a registered forester or certified arborist. All specimen trees within 60 feet of disturbed areas must be identified by species and location regardless of the counting procedure adopted. 
                  g.  The trees, both retained and new, where feasible shall be reasonably distributed throughout the site with emphasis on tree groupings to achieve results following professional landscape standards. 
                  h.  On residential subdivisions, trees may be retained or planted for credit within a public street right-of-way if meeting street tree planting requirements of article 24, development regulations, of zoning and development ordinance or per the approval of the county arborist/landscape architect. 
                  i.  Where the proposed development area is so dense that the minimum requirements of this ordinance cannot reasonably be achieved, the development area shall be reduced by removing parking spaces in excess of the number of spaces required by zoning, placing additional planting islands within the development area, or other similar measures. Where above-mentioned requirements are met and construction of improvements or existing dense tree cover continues to preclude the planting of the total number of replacement trees required on the site, the county arborist/landscape architect may approve a plan which results in the planting of the number of trees on the site which can reasonably be expected to be accommodated in a manner which will allow mature growth of the replacement trees. The remainder of the total number of trees may be planted in a local park, on public lands, or along rights-of-way or a contribution may be made to the tree replacement fund, subject to approval of the county arborist/landscape architect. 
                  i.  Public area planting. If trees are to be planted at another location, the following note must appear on the approved tree protection plan: "A tree protection plan addendum for this project shall be submitted to the County Arborist/Landscape Architect at least 30 days prior to requesting a final inspection. This plan shall include the species, size, and location of trees to be planted off-site to meet the remainder of the tree planting requirements. Issuance of a certificate of occupancy is subject to approval of this plan, as well as verification of the installation of the trees." 
                  ii.  Tree replacement fund. Where the minimum caliper inch or recompense requirements cannot be fully met because the site cannot support the required number of trees, the applicant may make a contribution to the tree replacement fund. Contributions to the tree replacement fund shall be paid in full prior to the issuance of any required permit. Such contributions shall be used for the sole purposes of planting and maintaining trees on public property. 
                  (1)  The amount of the contribution shall be based upon the number, size and type of trees that cannot be planted at the site. The county arborist/landscape architect shall estimate the cost to the county for the materials and labor associated with the trees. The amount of the contribution shall be 100 percent of the estimated costs for the materials and labor of planting such trees. 
                  j.  In order for a tree to qualify in meeting the above caliper inch per acre requirements, all canopy/shade replacement trees shall be at least eight feet tall planted and have a trunk of not less than two caliper inches. All understory/flowering replacement trees shall be at least six feet tall planted and have a main trunk of not less than one and one-half caliper inches. Multi-stemmed canopy trees shall count only the largest trunk for caliper. All multi-stemmed understory/flowering replacement trees shall have a minimum of three canes, each with a minimum one-inch caliper extending clear at least to a height of four feet. All evergreen replacement trees shall be at least a seven-gallon size, six feet tall planted, and have a main trunk of not less than one and one-half caliper inches. All tree formed, multi-stemmed, evergreen replacement trees shall have a minimum of three canes, each with a minimum one-inch caliper extending clear at least to a height of four feet and be pruned as tree form at time of planting. No more than 40 percent of any one genus may be included in any tree planting plan. 
                  k.  The minimum required quantity of trees on a site after development must produce the required total caliper inches per acre (or disturbed acre, as noted above), unless qualifies per this tree preservation ordinance as a single-family residential subdivision. Any portion of a property which is less than a full acre shall be prorated. The caliper inches per acre are determined as follows: 
                  Acreage = Total site area exclusive of any acreage within a zoning buffer (or) disturbed site area exclusive of any acreage within a zoning buffer for conditional use permits within residential only. 
                  Example: 50 inches per acre × 1.5 acres = 75 caliper inch requirement 
                  Credit for existing trees proposed to be retained on the site shall be calculated by adding the DBH of all qualifying trees to be retained on site. Credit shall be given for all trees retained on a property having a diameter of ten inches or more, except trees located in a required zoning buffer. One hundred percent of tree inches may be calculated from areas located in the floodplain or delineated as wetlands. 
                  Credit for new trees proposed to be replaced on the site shall be calculated by adding the caliper inches of all qualifying trees. Credit shall be given for all new trees replaced on the property except for new trees of less than one and one-half caliper inches and new trees planted in a required zoning buffer. 
                  Additional credit. Existing trees to be preserved within a minimum front and side yard area (as required by the applicable zoning district) shall be granted a bonus credit of an additional 50 percent of the actual DBH unless the tree is located within a required zoning buffer. Also, specimen trees retained per subsection 253A.6.b. shall be awarded two times the actual DBH. 
                  The number of new trees planted is determined as follows: 
                  Determine the total number of inches required based on the acreage. Subtract the total caliper inches of all trees being retained (including bonus credits if applicable). The remainder indicates the number of caliper inches, if any, that must be planted on the site. 
                  Note: Where there are not enough ten-inch DBH or greater existing trees, three-inch DBH or greater trees may be counted (in lieu of planting new trees), provided they have grown in uncrowded conditions and have developed normal spread or they are part of a specimen tree stand. 
                  Note: Tree diameter for existing trees is measured by DBH = diameter at breast height (four and one-half feet above ground). If a tree splits into multiple trunks below four and one-half feet, then the trunk is measured at its most narrow point beneath the split. 
                  Note: Tree diameter for new replacement trees is measured by caliper. The caliper of the trunk is measured six inches above the ground, up to and including four-inch caliper size, and 12 inches above the ground for larger sizes. If a tree has more than one trunk, only the largest trunk shall be used to establish the tree caliper for the tree. 
                  Existing trees proposed to be retained and new trees proposed to be planted in order to meet the buffer requirements of the zoning and development ordinance or conditions of zoning, special use or variance approval shall not be considered in fulfilling the requirements of this section concerning minimum caliper inch per acre requirements. Buffer requirements are considered to be in addition to the minimum caliper inch per acre requirements. See appropriate zoning district classification for any additional landscaping or buffering requirements and article 25, buffer area and screening requirements, of the zoning and development ordinance. 
                  6.  Specimen trees. 
                  a.  Some trees on a site warrant special consideration and encouragement for preservation. These trees are referred to as specimen trees. Trees unique due to age, size, species or historic relevance are to be identified during the survey process and special consideration must be made to work around them. It is required that all reasonable efforts be made to save specimen trees. Reasonable effort shall include, but not be limited to, alteration of building design, alternate building location, parking area, detention area, drainage system, or relocation of utilities. These trees are to be identified and highlighted on the tree protection plan. Design of buildings, hardscapes and utilities are to be developed with consideration to preserving and featuring specimen trees. 
                  b.  Caliper inch credits are given for existing trees that are saved during the site development process, with greater credits given to specimen trees. In order to encourage the preservation of specimen trees and the incorporation of these trees into the design of projects, additional (bonus) credit will be given for specimen trees which are successfully saved by a design feature specifically designated for such purpose. Credit for any specimen tree thus saved for such purpose would be two times the actual DBH of the specimen tree. 
                  c.  The following criteria are used by the county to identify specimen trees. Both the size and condition criteria must be met for a tree to qualify: 
                  i.  Size criteria: 
                  (1)  Large hardwoods (such as oaks, poplars, or sweetgums): Twenty-four-inch diameter or larger. 
                  (2)  Large softwoods (such as pines or deodar cedar): Thirty-inch diameter or larger. 
                  (3)  Small trees (such as dogwoods, redbuds, or sourwoods): Eight-inch diameter or larger. 
                  ii.  Condition criteria: 
                  (1)  Life expectancy of more than 15 years. 
                  (2)  Relatively sound and solid trunk with no extensive decay. 
                  (3)  No more than one major and several minor dead limbs (hardwoods only). 
                  (4)  No major insect or pathological problem. 
                  (5)  A lesser sized tree can be considered a specimen tree, if in the judgment of the county arborist/landscape architect: 
                  (a)  It is a rare or unusual species or of historical significance. 
                  (b)  It is specifically used by a builder, developer, or design professional as a focal point in a project or landscape. 
                  (c)  It is a tree with exceptional aesthetic quality. 
                  d.  Replacement of specimen trees. 
                  i.  In the event any specimen tree should be removed during the land development process, the applicant shall be required to replace any specimen tree being removed with suitable replacement trees elsewhere on the site. Removed specimen trees shall be replaced by species with potential for comparable size and quality. Tree replacement, in addition to other minimum planting requirements, shall be required in recompense for the removal of specimen trees. Specimen trees that are removed must be replaced by trees, minimum three-inch caliper, with an inch-for-inch replacement of the specimen tree removed. To determine if the replacement is reasonable the county arborist/landscape architect shall consider intended use of: 
                  (1)  Existing tree coverage, size, and type. 
                  (2)  Number of trees to be removed on the entire property. 
                  (3)  Number of trees to be saved on the entire property. 
                  (4)  Area to be covered with structures, parking, and driveways. 
                  (5)  Grading and drainage requirements. 
                  (6)  Character of the site and its environs. 
                  ii.  Any tree, designated on the tree protection plan to be saved, which is damaged during construction or as a result of construction, as determined by the county arborist/landscape architect, shall be replaced with a tree or trees equal to the DBH of the tree damaged. However, any specimen tree damaged as described above shall be replaced with trees equaling an inch-for-inch replacement of the tree damaged. 
                  iii.  In the event any specimen tree or trees should not survive more than 60 months following completion of development, the owner of the property shall be required to replace said tree or trees with replacement trees (three-inch minimum caliper) having an inch-for-inch replacement of the specimen tree removed on the site as approved by the county arborist/landscape architect. 
                  iv.  Any specimen tree which is removed without appropriate review and approval of the county arborist/landscape architect must be replaced by trees equaling a two times an inch-for-inch replacement of the tree removed. The owner of the property shall be required to replace said tree or trees with replacement trees which will be three-inch minimum caliper. Size alone will determine whether a tree was of specimen quality if the tree is removed without approval and there is not sufficient evidence of its condition. Such action may also result in a stop work order issued by the planning director. 
                  v.  Certain specimen trees which lie within an area of the site where preservation is in conflict with site development standards may be exempted from the inch-for-inch replacement requirements. Determination on exemption of specimen trees shall be by the planning director, in consultation with appropriate members of the development review committee including the county arborist. Factors for determining exemption shall include, but not be limited to, the following: 
                  (1)  Whether the tree is located within the footprint of the proposed building; and if so, whether it would be feasible to relocate or reorient the building; 
                  (2)  Whether the tree is located within an area where the grade will change by more than three feet and where a retaining wall protecting at least 67 percent of the critical root radius is not feasible; 
                  (3)  Whether the tree is located in an area that conflicts with necessary access points, such as a required driveway location determined by transportation safety standards. 
                  e.  The requirement to locate and preserve specimen tree(s) shall not apply to types of residential subdivision developments which are required to provide open space as part of the development. 
                  7.  Relocation of trees. 
                  a.  Trees to be relocated shall be removed with a root ball sized in proportion to their calipers. Root balls shall be 12 inches in diameter for each one inch of tree caliper. Trees four inches in caliper and smaller are to be measured six inches from the ground. Trees four inches to eight inches caliper are measured 12 inches from the ground, trees eight inches caliper or larger are measured from breast height. 
                  b.  Trees which are to be relocated in areas which do not require grading are to be placed directly into their new location. Trees to be relocated into the limit of work line shall have tree barriers placed around it in accordance with the plan. 
                  c.  Trees to be transplanted off site in full leaf shall be covered entirely with a protective cloth covering prior to transporting. Trees transplanted on site require no covering. 
                  d.  Trees which are to be relocated in areas to be graded are to be stockpiled. Stockpiled trees shall be well heeled in and protected from excessive wind and sun. The contractor shall provide water to maintain a healthy condition. 
                  e.  Where a tree is to be removed under the provisions of this tree preservation ordinance, the county may, with consent of the property owner, relocate the tree at the county's expense to county-owned property for replanting, either for permanent utilization at the new location, or for future use at another county property. 
                  f.  Credit may be given to the property for each relocated tree as though the tree was proposed to remain on the property, if the tree is relocated to a site designated by the county at the owner/developer's expense. 
                  8.  Removal of trees. 
                  a.  Safety standards. The contractor shall be solely responsible for pedestrian and vehicular safety and control within the work site and shall provide the necessary warning devices, barricades, and ground personnel needed to give safety, protection, and warning within the area where tree removal or pruning is to occur. Blocking of public streets shall not be permitted unless prior arrangements have been made with the county and is coordinated with appropriate departments. Traffic control is the responsibility of the contractor and shall be accomplished in conformance with state, county and local highway construction codes. 
                  b.  Tree pruning. Pruning is to be performed by tree workers who, through related training and on-the-job experience, are familiar with the techniques and hazards of this work including trimming, maintenance, repairing or removal, and equipment used in such operations. The use of climbing spurs or irons is not approved in pruning operations on live trees. This type of work is a potentially hazardous occupation and is to be undertaken only by trained personnel or under the supervision of trained personnel, all of whom are covered with workers' compensation, property damage, public liability, and completed operations insurance. 
                  c.  Tree removal. Trees shall be removed in accordance with accepted industry standards and procedures and in accordance with the following minimum requirements: Extreme care shall be taken so as to prevent limbs, branches and trunks from falling and creating damage to adjacent homes, driveways, sidewalks, trees, shrubs, streets and other property, both public and private. This type of work is a potentially hazardous occupation and is to be undertaken only by trained personnel or under the supervision of trained personnel, all of whom are covered with workers' compensation, property damage, public liability, and completed operations insurance. 
                  d.  Cleanup. Debris and logs shall not be left on the public right-of-way overnight. It shall be the responsibility of the contractor to remove and dispose of, in a proper and acceptable manner, all logs, brush and debris resulting from the tree removal operation unless otherwise directed by the county. No person shall be issued a tree removal permit unless said person agrees to remove all cut logs, brush, and debris from the premises. Removal of such debris shall be performed daily so as to not disrupt the work of other contractors on the site. Absolutely no burying on site is allowed. No burning on site is allowed without a permit issued by the Coweta County Fire Department. 
                  9.  Trees on private property. It shall be the duty of any person or persons owning or occupying property bordering on any street upon which property there may be trees, to prune such trees in such a manner that they will not obstruct or shade street lights, obstruct passage of pedestrians on sidewalks, obstruct vision of traffic signs, or obstruct views of any street intersection. Failure to comply with this ordinance shall constitute an ordinance violation punishable in accordance with Coweta Code of Ordinances, chapter 1, section 1-15. 
                  10.  Fees. Permits shall be obtained by any person or company engaged in the removal of trees, which are subject to this ordinance pursuant to section 252A.1.a., for a fee. The county arborist/landscape architect will review the tree removal plans and inspect the project site when necessary prior to tree removal of any trees. If significant trees are removed from any property without a tree removal permit, land disturbance permit, or building permit, the property owner shall pay a fine of three times the tree removal fee calculated. Minimum caliper inches per acre must be maintained at all times. Permit fees shall be as set forth in the fee schedule for Coweta County. 
                  11.  Penalties. Any person, firm, corporation, company, or partnership violating any provision of this tree preservation ordinance shall be punished as provided in section 1-15 of the Code of Ordinances. Where an offense continues from day to day, each day's continuance thereof shall be deemed a separate offense. The owner of a premises, where anything in violation of this tree preservation ordinance shall exist, or any person, firm, corporation, company, or partnership who may have assisted in the commission of such violation shall be guilty of a separate offense and, upon conviction thereof, shall be punished as herein provided. 
                  (Ord. No. 039-08, 12-11-08; Ord. No. 010-09, 5-19-09; Ord. No. 020-11, 8-18-11; Ord. No. 003-12, 2-7-12; Ord. No. 025-17, 8-22-17) 
                  ARTICLE 26. - OVERLAY DISTRICTS 

                  Sec. 260. - Community unit plan. 
                  A plan for the development of a tract of land, the proposed design of which makes it desirable to apply regulations more flexible than those contained in this ordinance, may be submitted to the board of commissioners for its consideration. Such a proposed development may contain residential uses of various types and allied uses such as churches, parks and day nurseries. After due public hearing and notice as described in the procedure for rezoning, the board of commissioners may approve such development upon a finding that the following conditions of fact exist: 
                  (1)  That the tract of land on which the development is to take place comprises not less than 200 acres. 
                  (2)  That the average lot area per family within the site, exclusive of streets, will not be less than 100 percent of the lot area per family required in the district in which the development is located. 
                  (3)  That, where desirable, adequate and properly located areas are dedicated for public uses such as schools, parks and playgrounds. 
                  (4)  That the property adjacent to the area included in the development will not be adversely affected, and that the public health, safety and general welfare will not be adversely affected. 
                  Sec. 261. - Quality development corridor overlay district. 
                  (A)  Purpose. The purpose of establishing the quality development corridor is to promote the health, safety and general welfare of the public; encourage harmonious community development; conserve natural resources; enhance the economic and aesthetic appeal and to promote orderly development of properties within the corridor. This ordinance is also intended to help reduce harmful effects resulting from heat, noise, and the glare of motor vehicle lights. The standards contained herein achieve the stated purpose by preventing or reducing traffic congestion and distracting visual clutter associated with development along major thoroughfares by addressing the following characteristic of development: buffer and landscaping, access, lighting, outdoor storage and impervious area. 
                  (B)  District delineation. Quality development corridor requirements established herein shall be applicable to all nonresidential properties and uses within the districts listed below: 
                  State Route 34 East Corridor, being more particularly along that portion of State Highway 34 East from the City Limits of Newnan to Ebenezer Church Road, as shown on the attached parcel base map entitled QDCD Map #34 E.

                  (E)  Development requirements. 
                  1)  Landscaping and screening requirements. In addition to the provisions of article 24, site development standards, section 242.2, landscape requirements of the Coweta County Zoning and Development Ordinance, land development within a quality development corridor district shall also meet the following landscaping requirements below and elsewhere in this section: 
                  a)  Landscape plan submission. The plan shall be submitted and approved as part of the predevelopment site plan as required by the provisions of this ordinance. The plan shall show lot or parcel dimensions, building dimensions, tree/landscape preservation areas, and the location and size of all tree and plant materials. 
                  All landscape plans must be prepared and stamped by a registered landscape architect licensed to practice in the State of Georgia and should follow these general principles: 
                  Preservation: an effort should be made to preserve as much of existing plant material and land form as possible; clear-cutting and mass grading are not acceptable practices. 
                  Xeriscape: landscapes should emphasize native plant species and efficient use of water. 
                  Permeability: the ease with which an individual is able to understand and navigate a place using landmarks and landscape clues. 
                  Context: sensitivity to prevailing building and geographic context (color, material, mass, function, topography). 
                  Place: forming a significant part of the urban landscape, landscapes are a tactile piece of the character of a place. 
                  Creativity: landscape design goes a long way toward beautifying the built environment. 
                  Quality: landscape design shall be designed in a sound manner and constructed according to accepted good planting procedures. 
                  b)  Street planting. The street planting area is defined as the unpaved segment of land located between the property line that abuts a right-of-way and any building or vehicular use area and designed for the preservation and placement of plant materials. If a parcel or lot has more than one street planting area (i.e. more than one street frontage), each shall be considered separately. If a building site contains more than one parcel or lot, the entire site shall be treated by the landscape ordinance as a single entity. 
                  The street planting area shall be a minimum of 20 feet in depth, as measured from the edge of the public right-of-way toward the center of the lot or parcel. 
                  Within the required street planting area, measuring the total length of the project street frontage exclusive of drives, trees from the large category shall be planted at intervals of 40 feet with either one medium category or three small category trees in between; however, creativity is encouraged. Trees in the large category shall be three inches caliper and not less than 12 feet in height at planting. Trees in the medium category shall be two and one-half inches caliper and not less than ten feet in height at planting. Trees in the small category shall be two inches caliper and not less than six feet in height at planting. The remaining area shall be landscaped with shrubs and ground cover. The shrubs and ground cover shall be defined in three categories: large shrubs (at a minimum size of 7 gallon and 3-foot in height at time of planting), medium shrubs (at a minimum size of 3 gallon and 18 inches in height at time of planting), and ground cover (at a minimum size of 4 inch pots and 4 inches in height at time of planting). Each category shall comprise of the following percentages of required shrubbery: a minimum 15% large shrubs, a minimum 15% medium shrubs, and maximum 10% ground cover. All plants must meet ASFNS standards. 
                  Signs may be placed within the street planting area, monument style, and placed at least ten horizontal feet from all property lines. No sign shall be erected that obstructs sight distance at an intersection or along a public right-of-way. In all zoning districts, no sign of any type or design that obstructs vision between the heights of three feet and 15 feet above grade shall be permitted within 20 feet of the intersection of the right-of-way lines of street and/or railroads. Traffic control signs and signals are exempt from this regulation. 
                  c)  Perimeter planting. The perimeter planting area is defined as the unpaved swath of land located between the side and/or rear property lines of a parcel or lot and designed for the preservation and placement of plant materials. The perimeter planting area shall be a minimum of ten feet in depth, as measured from the edge of the property line toward the center of the lot or parcel. 
                  Within the required perimeter planting, canopy trees from the large category shall be planted at intervals of 70 feet with either one medium category or three small category trees in between. Trees in the large category shall be three inches caliper and not less than 12 feet in height at planting. Trees in the medium category shall be two and one-half inches caliper and not less than ten feet in height at planting. Trees in the small category shall be two inches caliper and not less than six feet in height at planting. The remaining area shall be landscaped with shrubs and ground cover. The shrubs and ground cover shall be defined in three categories: large shrubs (at a minimum size of 7 gallon and 3-foot in height at time of planting), medium shrubs (at a minimum size of 3 gallon and 18 inches in height at time of planting), and ground cover (at a minimum size of 4 inch pots and 4 inches in height at time of planting). Each category shall comprise of the following percentages of required shrubbery: a minimum 15% large shrubs, a minimum 15% medium shrubs, and a maximum 10% ground cover. All plants must meet ASFNS standards. 
                  When any parcel or lot abuts an incompatible zoning district, the perimeter planting area shall be measured from the inside edge of the undisturbed buffer required by Article 25, Buffer and Screening Requirements, of the Coweta County Zoning and Development Ordinance. However, developments requiring buffer widths in excess of 50 feet may incorporate the perimeter landscaping into the buffer area provided the ten-foot landscape area is adjacent to the development and not the adjoining properties. 
                  d)  Interior planting. Shade trees shall be located in parking lot islands. Landscaped islands shall terminate each row of parking spaces. Terminal islands shall be at least ten feet wide and 18 feet long and include one shade tree. Trees shall be three inches caliper and not less than eight feet tall at planting. The remaining area of terminal islands shall be landscaped with shrubs and ground cover one foot high at planting. 
                  Interior islands shall be provided within each row of parking spaces. One interior island shall be provided for every ten parking spaces or fraction thereof. Each interior island shall be at least ten feet wide and 18 feet long and shall include one shade tree. Trees shall be three inches caliper and not less than eight feet tall at planting. The remaining area of interior islands shall be landscaped with shrubs and ground cover one foot in height at planting. 
                  The perimeter of terminal and interior islands shall be surrounded with a continuous raised curb. Island width and length shall be measured from the inside edge of the curb. Trees planted in islands must be allowed to grow to maturity and full canopy and shall not be pruned beyond requirements of basic maintenance. 
                  Small or understory category: The size range for this category of trees is 15 to 25 feet in height and 15 to 20 feet in width. This category shall be used primarily where there are overhead obstructions or in a planting area which cannot accommodate an overstory or shade tree. The Coweta County Arborist shall have the authority to disallow trees that are not suitable for a specific location due to growth habits of the tree or site conditions. The Coweta County Arborist shall determine proper installation. 

                   
                  Medium category: The size range for this category of trees is 25 to 50 feet in height and 25 to 40 feet in width. These trees shall be used primarily as street and shade trees. The Coweta County Arborist shall have the authority to disallow trees that are not suitable for a specific location due to growth habits of the tree or site conditions. The Coweta County Arborist shall determine proper installation. 

                   
                  Large or overstory category: The size range for this category of trees is 50 to 100 feet in height and 30 to 50 feet in width. These trees will be used primarily as street and shade trees. The Coweta County Arborist shall have the authority to disallow trees that are not suitable for a specific location due to growth habits of the tree or site conditions. The Coweta County Arborist shall determine proper installation. 

                   
                  Minimal planting ares shall be defined as areas in which, although the minimum dimensional requirements of the landscaped island or strip have been met, there are other factors which limit the growth area for a tree as determined by the county arborist (including, but not limited to, necessary retaining walls and adjacent to buildings). 
                  Additional trees in each category may be approved upon consultation with the Coweta County Arborist and Planning Director. In approving additional trees, factors considered shall include, but not be limited to, the following: growth rates and habits, form, hardiness with the planting zone, and resistance to pests and diseases. A list of any additional approved trees will be maintained in the Coweta County Planning Department and available upon request. 
                  e)  Lot remnant plantings. All land surfaces other than those that are covered by buildings, structures, paving, or other required site elements shall be landscaped with well maintained grass, flowers, shrubs, or other suitable plant materials approved by the planning department. The location and detail of all other landscaped areas shall be depicted on the required landscaping/tree protection plan. 
                  f)  Buffer plantings. All required buffers must meet requirements as spelled out in article 25, buffer area and screening requirements.

                  3)  Traffic management plan. A traffic management plan, prepared by a qualified professional engineer shall be submitted at the discretion of the county engineer, based on the size and intensity of the development, and traffic conditions. The traffic management plan must identify any traffic problems that will be generated by the development and present reasonable solutions to those problems. This plan must be submitted to the county engineer for approval. 
                  4)  Outdoor lighting. All outdoor lights or lighting arrangements used for purposes of advertising, security or night operations must be directed away from adjoining or nearby residential zoning lots and public roadways. Lighting shall be recessed. 
                  5)  Outdoor storage and display. 
                  a)  Objects not on a permanent foundation shall be considered outdoor storage. No outdoor storage will be permitted outside a fully enclosed building unless the storage area is entirely screened from the street and adjoining properties by a suitable fence or wall at least six feet in height above the finished grade. The required fence or wall must provide for a reasonable visual separation between the storage area and all adjoining property. 
                  b)  Objects must be on a permanenet foundation to be considered an outdoor display. A plan for outdoor display areas must be submitted to the planning director. If approval is granted, the planning director shall require such conditions that will, in his/her judgment, secure substantially the objectives of this ordinance.

                  (2)  The county planner indicates the apparent presence of a 100-year floodplain on the property unless a survey by a registered land surveyor or professional engineer states to the contrary. 
                  (3)  A review of the flood boundary and floodway map(s) for the county prepared for the Federal Insurance Administration indicates a possibility of the presence of a 100-year floodplain on the subject property unless a registered land surveyor or professional engineer certifies to the contrary.

                  Sec. 283. - Stay of proceedings. 
                  An appeal stays all legal proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from unless the planning official certifies to the board of zoning appeals after the notice of appeal shall have been filed with him that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life and property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the board or by a competent court on application or notice to the officer from whom the appeal is taken and on due cause shown. 
                  Sec. 284. - Powers and duties of the board of zoning appeals. 
                  The board of zoning appeals shall have the following powers and duties: 
                  Administrative review. To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by the planning official in the enforcement of this ordinance. 
                  Review. The zoning board of appeals shall act as a review board on all variances and conditional use applications and make a final recommendation to the board of commissioners. 
                  Sec. 284.1. - Duties by board of commissioners concerning an appeal or conditional use. 
                  Since the recommendation by the zoning board of appeals is a finding of fact, the board of commissioners shall not be required to conduct a hearing before making a final decision on any appeal or conditional use application. The board of commissioners shall act on any application when possible, and within 30 days from the date of submittal by the zoning board of appeals. If the zoning board of appeals does not submit a recommendation within the required 30-day period, the board of commissioners shall act upon the application within 60 days from the date of the initial submittal of a completed application to the zoning board of appeals. A property owner, with the consent of the board of commissioners may voluntarily withdraw the application. Once the applicant has withdrawn their application, the applicant must reapply as a new application, beginning with the zoning board of appeals. 
                  At the meeting before the board of commissioners, any party may appear in person or be represented by an agent or an attorney. 
                  The board may grant approval of a variance or conditional use only if the board finds that the proposed variance or conditional use would not adversely affect the health or safety of persons residing or working close to the proposed use, and the proposed use will not be detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to property values or public improvements in the surrounding area. The existence of a nonconforming use of neighboring land, buildings, or structures in the same or in the other districts shall not constitute a reason for a variance or conditional use. The following factors, where relevant, shall be considered in evaluating a variance or conditional use and may be granted in an individual case of unnecessary hardship upon a finding by the board of commissioners that one or more of the following factors may exist: 
                  (1)  Whether the variance or conditional use will permit a use that is suitable in view of the use and development of adjacent and nearby property; 
                  (2)  Whether the variance or conditional use will adversely affect the existing use or usability of adjacent or nearby property; 
                  (3)  Whether or not the special circumstances contribute to the request are peculiar to the particular property involved; 
                  (4)  Whether the variance or conditional use will result in a use, which will or could cause an excessive, or burdensome use of existing streets, transportation facilities, utilities, or schools; 
                  (5)  Whether there are other existing or changing conditions affecting the use and development of the property, which gives supportive grounds for either approval, or disapproval of the variance or conditional use; 
                  (6)  Whether or not the situation for which the request is being made poses an unnecessary hardship for the applicant; and 
                  (7)  Whether or not the request is due to an intentional action of the applicant to violate the requirements of this ordinance. 
                  If a conditional use permit is granted, the board of commissioners may specify and require such conditions in connection therewith as will, the board's opinion, assure that the proposed use will conform to the requirements and spirit of this ordinance. The following factors, where relevant, shall be considered in evaluating conditional use and may be granted in an individual case of unnecessary hardship upon a finding by the board of commissioners that all of the following conditions exist: 
                  (1)  The available existing street system is adequate to efficiently and safely accommodate the traffic, which will be generated by the proposed use or development. 
                  (2)  The existing public utilities, facilities and services are adequate to accommodate the proposed use or development. 
                  (3)  The use or development does not generate or cause conditions such as noise, light, glare, odor, or similar objectionable features which would reduce the value, use or enjoyment of surrounding properties. 
                  (4)  The proposed building(s) are not out of character with the surrounding area and zoning district in terms of building construction and general aesthetic appearance to the extent that the proposed building will have a detrimental impact on the value of nearby homes, businesses, or other properties. 
                  If, at any time after a conditional use permit has been issued, the planning official finds the conditions imposed and the agreements made have not been or are not being fulfilled by the holder of a conditional use permit, the permit shall be cancelled. The operation of such use must be discontinued. 
                  The board of commissioners shall notify the applicant of its final decision. 
                  Sec. 285. - Counsel and recommendations of the county planner to the board of zoning appeals. 
                  The board of zoning appeals, in making its recommendation, shall receive and carefully consider the recommendations of the Coweta County Planner on all matters presented to the board. 
                  Sec. 285.1. - Recommendations of the board of zoning appeals to the board of commissioners. 
                  The zoning board of appeals shall have 45 days from the date of submittal of a completed application to make its recommendation to the board of commissioners. However, in the case of submittal of an application proposing a development of regional impact, the board of zoning appeals shall have 45 days from receipt of the regional commission notice of finding and recommendation, and/or the Georgia Regional Transportation Authority decision on the DRI plan of development to make its recommendation to the board of commissioners. If the board of zoning appeals fails to make its recommendation within the 45-day period, it shall be deemed to have recommended approval of the proposed amendment. The above 45-day period may be extended with the approval of the applicant.

                  A property owner, with the consent of the board of commissioners, may voluntarily withdraw the application. Once the applicant has withdrawn their application they must reapply as a new application, beginning with the zoning board of appeals. 
                  In the event the applicant withdraws their application, the fee submitted shall not be refunded to the applicant. This is to ensure the costs associated with the processing of the application are utilized to compensate the county for the time, materials, and staffing used during the processing of the application.

                  The county planner may circulate the application and/or appropriate materials regarding said application to those agencies, departments, and/or entities of government which he deems to be appropriate for solicitation of comments. 
                  The county planner shall transmit to the board of commissioners his comments and recommendations concerning the application, prior to the date scheduled by the board for its consideration of the application. 
                  Sec. 292. - Notification and public hearing.

                  Whenever a proposed amendment to this ordinance, initiated by a party other than Coweta County, involves changing the zoning classification of property from one type of zone to another, the board of commissioners shall cause to be posted in a conspicuous place on the property a sign not less than 15 days prior to the date of the hearing. Such posted sign shall be not less than 12 square feet in area, and shall contain information as to the proposed zoning change and the date, time, and place of the public hearing before the board of commissioners.

                  Sec. 294. - Standards of review. 
                  In ruling on any application for a zoning map amendment, the board of commissioners shall act in the best interest of the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the county. In doing so the board will consider one or more of the following factors as these factors may be relevant to the application: 
                  (1)  The existing land use pattern; 
                  (2)  The possible creation of an isolated district unrelated to adjacent and nearby districts; 
                  (3)  The population density pattern and possible increase or overtaxing of the load on public facilities including, but not limited to, schools, utilities, and streets; 
                  (4)  The cost of the county and other governmental entities in providing, improving, increasing or maintaining public utilities, schools, streets and other public safety measures; 
                  (5)  The possible impact on the environment, including, but not limited to, drainage, soil erosion and sedimentation, flooding, air quality and water quantity; 
                  (6)  Whether the proposed zoning map amendment would have an adverse impact on the value, use, enjoyment, or potential development of adjacent property; 
                  (7)  Whether there are substantial reasons why the property cannot be used in accordance with existing regulations; 
                  (8)  The aesthetic effect of existing and future use of the property as it relates to the surrounding area; 
                  (9)  The possible effects of the proposed zoning map amendment on the character of a zoning district, a particular piece of property, neighborhood, a particular area, or the community; 
                  (10)  The relation that the proposed zoning map amendment bears to the purpose of the overall zoning scheme, with due consideration given to whether or not the proposed change will help carry out the purposes of those zoning regulations; 
                  (11)  The consideration of the preservation of the integrity of residential neighborhoods shall be considered to carry great weight; 
                  (12)  In those instances in which property fronts on a major thoroughfare and also adjoins an established residential neighborhood, the factor or [of] preservation of the residential area shall be considered to carry great weight; 
                  (13)  Any other factors relevant to the balancing of interests in promoting the public health, safety, morality or general welfare against a right to unrestricted use of property; 
                  (14)  Whether the proposed zoning map amendment is consistent or inconsistent with the county's comprehensive land use plan and the county's development goals and objectives. 
                  After hearing evidence at the zoning hearing the board of commissioners shall apply the evidence to the standards of review in making their decision. It will not be required that the board of commissioners consider every criteria contained in the standards of review. It shall be the duty of the applicant to carry the burden of proof that the proposed zoning map amendment promotes the public health, safety, morality or general welfare. 
                  If the board of commissioners determines from the ordinance presented that the applicant has shown that the proposed zoning map amendment promotes the health, safety, morals and general welfare under the standards of review, then the application shall be granted, subject to those reasonable conditions as may be imposed by the commissioners pursuant to section 295. Otherwise, the commission shall deny the application or impose upon said property any appropriate zoning classification, including conditions allowed by section 295, which might be consistent with the considerations contained in the "standards of review" presented above. 
                  If the proposed project is to be served with an on-site septic system, the applicant shall be required, as a condition of approval, to submit a soil analysis prior to the issuance of any development permits. The soil analysis shall be prepared by and bear the seal of a Georgia registered engineer who is practicing geotechnical engineering, and shall be acceptable to the county's environmental health department requirements as follows: 
                  The soil analysis must be a comprehensive soil analysis showing soil classifications, predicted and/or measured seasonal high ground water levels, perched water tables, or other restrictive layers such as rocks. The report shall also include wetland delineation and any soil features or conditions which may affect the proper function of subsurface sewage disposal, including absorption rates at specific depths. 
                  Sec. 295. - Conditional zoning. 
                  In deciding upon any application for a zoning map amendment, the board of commissioners may, on their own motion or upon the suggestion of the applicant, grant the application subject to certain conditions necessary to promote and protect the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the county. Such conditions shall be imposed for the benefit of the community to lessen any negative effects that the zoning map amendment may cause. 
                  The board of commissioners may grant any zoning map amendment and include conditions as follows: 
                  (1)  Such conditions as are deemed necessary to protect neighbors and to lessen any negative effects of the zoning change. 
                  (2)  That the rezoning is conditional upon the condition that the applicant or any successor in title may implement only those uses and only in such manner as is depicted upon any site plan submitted and approved with the application. 
                  Prior to a final vote being taken upon any application for zoning map amendment in which conditions shall be imposed, such conditions will be announced at the meeting and the applicant shall be afforded an opportunity to present its position on such conditional requirements. If the applicant finds such proposed conditional requirements to be unacceptable, it may, at that time, withdraw its application for zoning map amendment; such withdrawal shall not enable such applicant to refile for a zoning map amendment contrary to county or state law, and there shall be no refund of the rezoning fee which had been paid to the county with such withdrawn application. 
                  If the board of commissioners adopts a zoning map amendment which contains conditional requirements, such requirements shall become a part of this ordinance and the official zoning map. Such property shall thereafter carry the suffix "c" to indicate that such property has been conditionally zoned (e.g., CBc, LMc, Mc, Cc, etc.). Such conditions shall be binding upon all owners of the property until removed or modified by the board of commissioners. Provided, however, that any use designated or indicated for a building or outparcel on a conceptual or preliminary site plan, where such plan is required as a part of the zoning process, or any such specific use designated as a condition of zoning on a building or outparcel shall be for descriptive purposes to indicate a degree of general anticipated intensity of use, and the county planner may approve and permit any otherwise permitted use of any such building or outparcel, under the applicable zoning district, unless such use is specifically prohibited by a condition of zoning or requires a special use permit, so long as the county planner determines that such other proposed use does not significantly increase the intensity of the proposed use of such building or outparcel. The county planner shall so indicate in the records of the zoning actions the existence of the conditional requirements. 
                  In those instances where a rezoning is granted which is conditional upon the submitted site plan, such property shall revert to its former zoning classification by operation of law if a building permit for such development has not been applied for within one year; provided that the board of commissioners, at a zoning hearing, may extend this period for good cause shown by the property owner. 
                  It shall be the duty of the planning director to periodically review such conditional rezoning and to report to the board of commissioners those rezoning actions which have reverted by operation of law.
