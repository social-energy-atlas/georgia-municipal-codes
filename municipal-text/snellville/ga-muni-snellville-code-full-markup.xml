PREFACE 
</p>
        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Snellville, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1977 Code, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the mayor and city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1977 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. Also, included in part I of this publication is the city's new Charter adopted in 2001. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which 
may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Ron K. McLaughlin, Code Attorney, and Leesa Hampton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Brett A. Harrell, Mayor; Sharon Lowery, City Clerk; and Michael T. Byrne, City Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

                  --- (1) --- 
                  Editor's note— Printed in this part I is 2001 Georgia Laws, page 4566, as adopted by the Georgia General Assembly, being and constituting the city's Charter. Amendments to this act are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original act. Obvious misspellings have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes, a uniform system of headings, catchlines, and citations to state statutes has been used. Additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets. 

                  ARTICLE I. - INCORPORATION AND POWERS 

                  Section 1.10. - Name. 
                  This city and the inhabitants thereof are hereby constituted and declared a body politic and corporate under the name and style City of Snellville, Georgia, and by that name shall have perpetual succession. 
                  Section 1.11. - Corporate boundaries. 
                  (a)  The boundaries of this city shall be those existing on the effective date of the adoption of this Charter with such alterations as may be made from time to time in the manner provided by law. The boundaries of this city at all times shall be shown on a map, a written description, or any combination thereof, to be retained permanently in the office of the city clerk and to be designated, as the case may be, "Official Map of the Corporate Limits of the City of Snellville, Georgia." Photographic, typed, or other copies of such map or description certified by the city clerk shall be admitted as evidence in all courts and shall have the same force and effect as with the original map or description. 
                  (b)  The mayor and city council may provide for the redrawing of any such map by ordinance to reflect lawful changes in the corporate boundaries. A redrawn map shall supersede for all purposes the entire map or maps which it is designated to replace. 
                  Section 1.12. - Powers and construction. 
                  (a)  This city shall have all powers possible for a city to have under the present or future constitution and laws of this state as fully and completely as though they were specifically enumerated in this Charter. This city shall have all the powers of self-government not otherwise prohibited by this Charter or by general law. 
                  (b)  The powers of this city shall be construed liberally in favor of the city. The specific mention or failure to mention particular powers shall not be construed as limiting in any way the powers of this city. 
                  Section 1.13. - Reserved. 
                  Editor's note— HRO 2017-02, § 1, adopted Mar. 27, 2017, deleted § 1.13 entitled "Examples of powers." 
                  Section 1.14. - Exercise of powers. 
                  All powers, functions, rights, privileges, and immunities of the city, its officers, agencies, or employees shall be carried into execution as provided by this Charter. If this Charter makes no provision, such shall be carried into execution as provided by ordinance or as provided by pertinent laws of the State of Georgia. 
                  Sections 1.15—1.19. - Reserved. 
                  Section 1.20. - Form of government. 
                  The form of government adopted for the City of Snellville, Georgia by this Charter is the Council-Manager form as described in the model charter provision of the Georgia Municipal Association. The model charter describes this form as one that derives its name from the fact that a professional city manager is hired to administer the daily affairs of the city with the oversight of the legislative mayor and city council. Administrative authority is concentrated in one individual. This person is usually much more qualified to manage the day-to-day affairs of the city than the average city official because of specialized experience and training in the area of city management. In addition, if the manager is found to be incompetent or inefficient, the council has the power of appointment and removal. In this form of government, the mayor functions as the chair of the legislative branch of government and has the responsibility of communicating the actions of the city council to the manager. 
                  (HRO 2017-01, § 1, 3-27-2017)

The mayor and councilmembers shall be elected in the manner provided by general law and this Charter.

Any person serving as mayor or as councilmember of a different post desiring to become a candidate for councilmember shall resign his or her position of mayor or councilmember of a different post upon qualifying as a candidate for councilmember.

                  (1)  Engage in any business or transaction, nor have a financial or other personal interest, direct or indirect, which is incompatible with the proper discharge of his or her official duties or which would tend to impair the independence of his or her judgment or action in the performance of his or her official duties; 
                  (2)  Engage in or accept private employment or render services for private interests when such employment or service is incompatible with the proper discharge of his or her official duties or would tend to impair the independence of his or her judgment or action in the performance of his or her official duties; 
                  (3)  Disclose confidential information, including information obtained at meetings which are closed pursuant to O.C.G.A. tit. 50, ch. 14, concerning the property, government, or affairs of the governmental body by which he or she is engaged without proper legal authorization or use such information to advance the financial or other private interest of himself or herself or others; 
                  (4)  Accept any valuable gift, whether in the form of service, loan, thing, or promise, from any person, firm, or corporation which to his or her knowledge is interested, directly or indirectly, in any manner whatsoever, in business dealings with the governmental body by which he or she is engaged; provided, however, that an elected official who is a candidate for public office may accept campaign contributions and services in connection with any such campaign; 
                  (5)  Represent other private interests in any action or proceeding against this city or any portion of its government; or 
                  (6)  Vote or otherwise participate in the negotiation or in the making of any contract with any business or entity in which the official has financial interest. 
                  (c)  Disclosure. Any elected official, appointed officer, or employee who shall have any private financial interest, directly or indirectly, in any contract or matter pending before or within any department of the city shall disclose such private interest to the city council. The mayor or any councilmember who has a private interest in any matter pending before the city council shall disclose such private interest consistent with the city's code of ethics and such disclosure shall be entered on the records of the city council, and that official shall disqualify himself or herself, consistent with the city's code of ethics, from participating in any decision or vote relating thereto. Any elected official, appointed officer, or employee of any agency or political entity to which this Charter applies who shall have any private financial interest, directly or indirectly, in any contract or matter pending before or within such entity shall disclose such private interest to the governing body of such agency or entity. 
                  (d)  Use of public property. No elected official, appointed officer, or employee of the city or any agency or entity to which this Charter applies shall use property owned by such governmental entity for personal benefit, convenience, or profit except in accordance with policies promulgated by the city council or the governing body of such agency or entity. 
                  (e)  Contracts voidable and rescindable. Any violation of this section which occurs with the knowledge, express or implied, of a party to a contract or sale shall render said contract or sale voidable at the option of the city council. 
                  (f)  Ineligibility of elected official. Except where authorized by law, neither the mayor nor any councilmember shall hold any other elective or compensated appointive office in the city or otherwise be employed by said government or any agency thereof during the term for which he or she was elected. No former mayor and no former councilmember shall hold any compensated appointive office in the city until one year after the expiration of the term for which he or she was elected. 
                  (g)  Political activities of certain officers and employees. No appointive officer and no employee of the city shall continue in such employment upon qualifying as a candidate for nomination or election to any public office in the city. No employee of the city shall continue in such employment upon election to any public office in this city or any other public office which is inconsistent, incompatible, or in conflict with the duties of the city employee. Such determination shall be made by the mayor and city council either immediately upon election or at any time such conflict may arise. No elected official shall serve as an officer or on the board of a homeowners' association located within the city. No member of an elected official's immediate family shall serve as an employee of the city. 
                  (h)  Penalties for violation. 
                  (1)  Any city officer or employee who knowingly conceals such financial interest or knowingly violates any of the requirements of this section shall be guilty of malfeasance in office or position and shall be deemed to have forfeited his or her office or position. 
                  (2)  Any officer or employee of the city who shall forfeit his or her office or position as described in paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be ineligible for appointment or election to or employment in a position in the city government for a period of three years thereafter.

Any person who fails or refuses to obey a lawful order issued in the exercise of these powers by the city council shall be punished as provided by ordinance.

Included in the sales contract shall be a provision for the rights-of-way of said street, avenue, alley, or public place. Each abutting property owner shall be notified of the availability of the property and given the opportunity to purchase said property under such terms and conditions as set out by ordinance.

                  (c)  A surcharge may be imposed upon any person making a payment by credit card, when such surcharges are permitted by the operating rules and regulations of the credit card issuer.

                  (e)  No person making payment by credit card to the city is relieved from liability for the underlying obligation except to the extent that the city actually receives final payment of the obligation in cash or its equivalent. If final payment is not made by the credit card issuer or other guarantor of payment in the credit card transaction, the underlying obligation for the money due is not extinguished. All applicable penalties, interest and collection fees on the unpaid amount shall be due from the person making the payment by credit card. Such penalties, interest and fees on an unpaid amount shall accrue from the date the unpaid obligation was first due under the applicable statute or ordinance. The city shall follow the collection procedures for the unpaid amount that would have otherwise been applicable had the credit card payment not been attempted.

                  In order for the city council to take any official action on any subject, a council member must propose a main motion. A proposed main motion will not be recognized by the chairman until another council member agrees to second the motion.

Debatable subsidiary motions consist of motions to postpone indefinitely, amend, refer to the committee and postpone to a time certain. Debatable subsidiary motions require a second before they can be voted on or debated. There are three undebatable subsidiary motions: Limit debate, vote immediately, and lay on the table. Such motions require a second and cannot be debated. 
                  (c)  Council members may also introduce privileged motions. Privileged motions facilitate the running of the meeting and can be introduced during the course of debate. Privileged motions consist of a motion to raise a question of privilege and motions to recess and adjourn. The motions to recess and adjourn require a second. Debate is not allowed on privileged motions.

                  a.  If debate has been completed and no other council member wishes to speak, the chairman may call for the vote; if there are no objections then the chairman may proceed with the vote. 
                  b.  If the chairman calls for the vote and there is an objection, a council member may move to vote immediately (move the previous question). If this motion is seconded and approved by a majority vote, debate will stop. The chairman will then read the proposed motion to the city council and ask for the votes of the council members. 
                  (2)  Undebatable motions. In the case of undebatable motions, the vote shall occur immediately after the motion is recognized by the chairman. The chairman shall read the proposed motion to the city council and then call for the vote.

                  Sec. 2-86. - Ranking of motions. 
                  (a)  Each subsidiary and privileged motion is assigned a specific rank. A motion of higher precedence can interrupt a motion of lower precedence. The higher motion must be decided before the city council returns to consider the motion of lower precedence. 
                  (b)  A main motion has the lowest rank and does not take precedence over any other motion. A motion to adjourn has the highest rank and will take precedence over all other subsidiary and privileged motions. The order of precedence of motions shall be in accordance with this section. Motions at the bottom of the following list take precedence over motions at the top of the list:

                  (Ord. of 4-28-2003(2)) 
                  Sec. 2-87. - Subsidiary motions. 
                  During the course of debate, council members may introduce motions which propose that the city council take a particular action on a main motion. These motions are called subsidiary motions and they allow the city council to reach a conclusion on the main motion. Subsidiary motions require a second before they can be voted on or debated. Three subsidiary motions (amend, limit debate and vote immediately) also may apply to other subsidiary motions. 
                  (1)  Postpone indefinitely. If a council member believes that the main motion should not be considered by the city council, such council member may move to postpone the consideration of the main motion indefinitely. If the motion is successful, consideration of the main motion stops and the main motion is tabled. A motion to postpone indefinitely may be debated, but it cannot be amended. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (2)  Amend. If a council member believes that a main motion that is on the table should be changed in order to make it more acceptable, he can move to amend the motion. 
                  a.  Amendments must be closely related to the original motion and must not change the nature of the motion that they amend. 
                  b.  Motions to refer, amend, postpone to a time certain and the motion to recess can also be amended. 
                  c.  A motion shall not be amended more than two times. 
                  d.  Debate is allowed on a motion to amend only if the original motion is debatable. 
                  e.  A majority vote is required for the city council to adopt an amendment. 
                  f.  If the amendment is adopted, the city council shall consider the amended version of the motion. 
                  (3)  Refer to a committee (commit). If a council member believes that further information is needed before the city council can act on a main motion, he may propose that the motion be referred to a specific committee or department for further study. If an appropriate committee does not already exist, then a committee may be formed as a part of the motion. A motion to refer should specify the date that the committee or department will report back to the city council. This motion is debatable and amendable. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (4)  Postpone to a time certain (postpone definitely). A motion to postpone to a certain time may be proposed if a council member believes that the main motion should not be considered until a future time. This motion shall set a particular time for the main motion to be considered again. Such motion is debatable and may be amended. If this motion is passed, the chairman will bring the original motion back to the city council for consideration at the specified time. A majority vote of the city council is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (5)  Limit or extend limits of debate. A motion to limit debate places a time constraint on the length of debate. The details of such a motion are to be decided by the council member who makes the motion. This motion can also be used to extend the limits of debate if a limit on debate already exists. Debate is not allowed on this motion, and a majority vote of the city council is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (6)  Vote immediately (previous question). If a council member believes that the motion that is being considered should be voted on, the council member may move to vote immediately. The motion is undebatable, and a vote of majority of the city council is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (7)  Lay on the table (postpone temporarily). A motion to lay on the table proposes that the consideration of a main motion be postponed until a later time in the meeting. The motion can be brought up for consideration only if a motion to resume consideration is accepted by the city council during the same meeting. The motion will die if it is not taken up during the meeting. Debate is not allowed on this motion, and the motion is not amendable. A majority vote of the city council is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (Ord. of 4-28-2003(2)) 
                  Sec. 2-88. - Privileged motions. 
                  Privileged motions facilitate the running of the city council meeting. Such motions do not address or relate to a main motion and can be introduced whether or not there is a main motion under consideration. Privileged motions take precedence over all subsidiary motions. Debate is not allowed on such motions. 
                  (1)  Question of privilege. A formal question addressed to the chairman concerning the rights of a council member or of the city council as a whole is referred to as a question of privilege. It does not require a second and cannot be debated or amended. The chairman is required to make a ruling on the question. 
                  (2)  Recess. A motion to recess proposes that the meeting be suspended for a particular amount of time. The motion must specify the length of the recess. The motion must also be seconded. Debate is not allowed on such motion, but the motion can be amended. A majority vote of the city council is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (3)  Adjourn. In order for a meeting to come to a close, a council member must make a motion to adjourn. The motion to adjourn has the highest rank of any motion, and as a result, it can be introduced at any time. The motion requires a second, but is not debatable or amendable. A majority vote of the city council is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (Ord. of 4-28-2003(2)) 
                  Sec. 2-89. - Incidental motions. 
                  Incidental motions allow council members to exert their rights as a member of the city council. Incidental motions may be introduced at any time during a meeting. 
                  (1)  Appeal. If a council member disagrees with a decision that is made by the chairman, such council member may appeal the decision. If the appeal is seconded, the appeal will be considered by the city council. The chairman has the opportunity to explain the ruling that has been challenged. The city council may then debate the appeal. The city council shall decide by majority vote if the chairman's decision is to be upheld or overturned. An appeal is high in precedence and may only be interrupted by a privileged motion or by a motion to lay on the table. 
                  (2)  Parliamentary inquiry. If a council member has a question about the rules of order, he may ask the chairman to give an opinion on that question. Such question should take the form of a parliamentary inquiry and should relate to the current business of the city council. Such motion takes precedence over all motions except privileged motions. Such motion does not require a second and is not debatable or amendable. 
                  (3)  Point of order (question of order). If a council member believes that a violation of the rules of parliamentary procedure has occurred, he can raise a point of order. A second is not required. The chairman may make a ruling on the question or may allow the city council to debate and then rule on the question by majority vote. A point of order may only be interrupted by a privileged motion or a motion to lay on the table. 
                  (4)  Point of information (request for information). If a council member has a question about the facts of a particular issue that is being considered, he may ask a point of information. This motion is addressed first to the chairman and then to the appropriate person. A second is not required and the motion is not debatable or amendable. 
                  (Ord. of 4-28-2003(2)) 
                  Sec. 2-90. - Supplementary main motions. 
                  Three motions allow the city council to act on a main motion that has either been passed or tabled by the city council. These motions are considered to be main motions but differ from usual main motions in the following ways: 
                  (1)  Reconsider. The motion to reconsider allows the city council to debate whether or not to overturn a decision made at the meeting that is in progress. Such motion allows the city council to consider new information that may affect the decision that has already been made. Any council member may make a motion to reconsider, and any council member may second the motion. The motion is debatable, but it cannot be amended. A majority vote of the city council is required for the motion to pass. If a motion to reconsider is passed, the original decision will be voided and the city council will return to debate and revote the original motion. 
                  (2)  Rescind. A motion to rescind proposes that the city council overturn a motion passed at a previous meeting. A motion to rescind can be made by any council member. Such motion is in order as long as the original motion has not been implemented. An announcement of the intention to rescind a motion may be made at the meeting where the decision was made, or the council member seeking to rescind may place the matter on the agenda for the next meeting pursuant to section 2-48. The motion to rescind will then be placed on the agenda for the next meeting. At the next meeting, the motion to rescind will formally be made. If such motion is seconded, then the city council shall debate and vote on rescission. A majority vote of the city council is required for the motion to pass. If a motion to rescind is passed, the original decision will be voided. 
                  (3)  Resume consideration. The motion to resume consideration allows the city council to consider a motion that has been temporarily postponed. Such motion requires a second and is not debatable or amendable. Such motion is a main motion, but ranks higher than any debatable motion. A majority vote of the city council is required for the motion to pass.

Pursuant to this section, such request to postpone shall not require a second or a vote and shall not be subject to debate; provided, however, that no proposed amendment to this Code shall be the subject of a request to postpone under this section more than once.

                  d.  The contract shall be awarded with reasonable promptness by appropriate written notice to the lowest responsible and responsive bidder whose bid meets the requirements and criteria set forth in the invitation for bids. In the event the low responsive and responsible bid for a given project exceeds available funds as certified by the appropriate fiscal officer, and such bid does not exceed such funds by more than five percent, the city manager is authorized, when time or economic considerations preclude resolicitation of work of a reduced scope, to negotiate an adjustment of the bid price with the low responsive and responsible bidder, in order to bring the bid within the amount of available funds. 
                  (2)  Competitive sealed proposals. 
                  a.  When the city manager, or other relevant department head, determines that the use of competitive sealed bidding is either not practicable or not advantageous to the city, a contract may be entered into by use of the competitive sealed proposals method. 
                  b.  As provided in a request for proposals, discussions may be conducted with responsible offerors who submit proposals determined to be reasonably susceptible of being selected for award for the purpose of clarification to assure full understanding of, and conformance to, the solicitation requirements. 
                  c.  Award shall be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal is determined in writing to be the most advantageous to the city, taking into consideration price and the evaluation factors set forth in the request for proposals. No factors other than those set forth in the request for proposals may be used in the evaluation.

                  A CODE OF ETHICS FOR CITY OFFICIALS 
                  The public judges its government by the way public officials and employees conduct themselves in the posts to which they are elected or appointed. 
                  All government, or right, originates with the people, is founded upon their will only; and is instituted solely for the good of the whole. Public officers are the trustees and servants of the people and are at all times amenable to them. Ga. Const. Art. 1, § 2, Paragraph 1. 
                  The people of this state have the inherent right of regulating their internal government. Government is instituted for the protection, security, and benefit of the people; and at all times they have the right to alter or reform the same whenever the public good may require it. Ga. Const. Art. 1, § 2, Paragraph 2. 
                  The people have a right to expect that every public official will conduct himself in a manner that will tend to preserve public confidence in and respect for the government he represents. 
                  Such confidence and respect can best be promoted if every public official, whether paid or unpaid, and whether elected or appointed, will uniformly: (a) treat all citizens with courtesy, impartiality, fairness and equality under the law; and (b) avoid conflicts between their private self-interest and the public interest. 
                  ARTICLE I. - PURPOSE 

                  Sec. 3-1. - Declaration of policy. 
                  (a)  It is the policy of the city that the proper operation of democratic government requires that public officials be independent, impartial and responsible to the people; that governmental decisions and policy be made in proper channels of the governmental structure; that public office not be used for personal gain; and that the public have confidence in the integrity of its government. In recognition of these goals, a code of ethics for all city officials is adopted. 
                  (b)  This code has the following purposes: 
                  (1)  To encourage high ethical standards in official conduct by city officials; 
                  (2)  To establish guidelines for ethical standards of conduct for all such officials by setting forth those acts or actions that are incompatible with the best interest of the city; 
                  (3)  To require disclosure by such officials of private, financial or other interest in manners that affect the city; and 
                  (4)  To serve as a basis for disciplining those who refuse to abide by its terms. 
                  (c)  The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to political contributions, loans, expenditures, reports or regulation of political campaigns or the conduct of candidates in such campaigns.

                  (b)  In case of the death of a licensee, the establishment shall be allowed to continue to sell alcoholic beverages for a period of 45 days from the date of death or until expiration of the license or until approval of a new licensee, whichever shall first occur. 
                  (c)  In the event that a license is surrendered, or a licensee severs her or his association with a licensed establishment, the establishment may continue to sell alcoholic beverages for a period of 45 days from the date of surrender, or from the date determined by the planning and development director to be the date of severance. Provided that no such sale shall be authorized until such time as a new application for a license is made, said application indicating that no other change of ownership has occurred. Upon issuance of a new license, the authorization to sell under the previous license shall be revoked by operation of law. No additional license fees shall be required during the period for which the original license was issued. 
                  (d)  Nothing in this section, however, shall prohibit one or more of the partnerships holding a license to withdraw from a partnership in favor of one or more of the partners who were partners at the time of the issuance of the license. This section shall not prohibit transfer of stock between persons who held stock in the corporation at the time of issuance of the license, nor shall it prohibit transfers of stock which do not result in any person increasing his stock holdings to a total of ten percent or more of any class of stock.

                  (g)  Should a licensee make application to the planning and development director for a transfer of location and should such a transfer of a location be approved, with no change of ownership of the business, the license fee paid for the previous license shall be applied to the new location.

Any renewal applications received after November 1 of the latest year in which the license is in effect shall pay, in addition to said annual fee, a late charge of 20 percent.

                  (e)  No location which is licensed to sell alcoholic beverages on the effective date of this chapter shall be denied continued operation under an existing license, or denied any renewal of such license, nor shall any new owner of said location be denied a new license based upon the measurements set forth in this section. 
                  (f)  As to any location licensed in the future, if the distance requirements herein are met at the time of issuance of any license, the subsequent opening and operation of a house of worship or school within the distance prohibited herein shall not prevent the continuance of an existing license or the renewal thereof or the issuance of a new license to any subsequent owner of such property. Provided, however, that the distance requirements herein shall not apply at any location for which a new license is applied for if the sale of alcoholic beverages was lawful at such location at any time during the 12 months immediately preceding such application.

                  Sec. 6-88. - Types of entertainment, attire and conduct prohibited. 
                  (a)  Preamble and purpose: 
                  (1)  Based upon the experiences of other urban counties and municipalities, including but not limited to: Atlanta and Fulton County, Georgia; DeKalb County, Georgia; Austin, Texas; Seattle and Renton, Washington; New York, New York; Los Angeles, California; and Ft. Lauderdale and Palm Beach, Florida; which experiences the mayor and council believes are relevant to the problems faced by the city and based upon the evidence and testimony of the citizens and experts who have appeared before such bodies, the mayor and council takes note of the notorious and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within our country. 
                  (2)  Moreover, it is the finding of the mayor and council that public nudity and semi-nudity, under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances relating to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in so-called "nude bars" or establishments offering so-called "nude entertainment," "adult entertainment," or "erotic entertainment" begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with nudity and alcohol are disorderly conduct, prostitution, and drug trafficking and use. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with nudity and alcohol are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhoods, increased expenditure for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described, and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas. Therefore, the limitation of nude or semi-nude conduct in establishments licensed to sell alcohol for consumption on the premises is in the public welfare and is a matter of governmental interest and concern to prevent the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which serve alcohol and also allow and/or encourage nudity or semi-nudity. 
                  (b)  Any establishment licensed under the provisions of this chapter is prohibited from permitting or engaging in the following activities: 
                  (1)  The employment or use of any person, in any capacity, in the sale or service of alcoholic beverages while such person is unclothed or in such attire, costume or clothing as to expose to view any portion of the female breast below the top of the areola or of any portion of the pubic hair, anus, cleft of the buttocks, vulva or genitals; or 
                  (2)  Live entertainment, which provides or features nude or semi-nude or erotic dancing, or the performance of obscene acts or acts, which simulate: 
                  a.  Sexual intercourse, masturbation, sodomy, bestiality, oral copulation, flagellation or any sexual acts which are prohibited by law; or 
                  b.  The touching, caressing or fondling of the breast, buttock, anus or genitals; or 
                  c.  The displaying of the pubic hair, anus, vulva or genitals. 
                  (3)  The showing of any film, still pictures, electronic reproduction or other visual reproductions depicting any of the acts described in subsection (2) above which are obscene under state law; or 
                  (4)  The holding, promotion or allowance of any contest, promotion, special night or any other activity where patrons of the licensed establishment are encouraged or allowed to engage in any of the above-prohibited conduct. 
                  (c)  Mainstream activity excluded. Notwithstanding the prohibitions in subsection (b) above, nothing in this chapter shall or is intended to apply to theatrical or motion picture performance houses, museums, or the like where the consumption or service of alcohol is not a primary purpose or mainstream activity of such establishment.

Provided, however, in the case of an employee, the planning and development director or his designee must determine that the acts of the employee were known to or under reasonable circumstances should have been known to the licensee, were condoned by the licensee, or where the licensee has not established practices or procedures to prevent the violation from occurring.

The planning commission member shall be named by the respective organizations immediately to a two-year term.

                  Sec. 10-31. - Findings; public purpose. 
                  Based on the experiences of other counties and municipalities, including, but not limited to Houston, Texas, Tucson, Arizona, Chattanooga, Tennessee, Minneapolis, Minnesota, Dayton, Ohio, and Gwinnett County, Georgia, which experiences are found to be relevant to the problems faced by the City of Snellville, and based on documentary evidence and oral presentation during the meeting of the mayor and council on March 24, 2003; and based upon the record of the Gwinnett County Board of Commissioners' public hearing and regular meeting on August 7, 2001, including the record of testimony by Colonel John Latty, Officer John Jenkins, and Investigator J. P. Droualt of the Gwinnett Police Department, and further comments in that meeting by representatives of the adult entertainment industry, the mayor and council of the City of Snellville take note of the well-known and self-evident conditions and secondary effects attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among the various communities within our country. 
                  It is the finding of the mayor and council of the City of Snellville that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in establishments offering live nude entertainment or "adult entertainment," (whether such alcoholic beverages are sold on the premises or not) begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. In the same manner, establishments offering cinematographic or videographic adult entertainment have the same deleterious effects on the community. 
                  Among the acts of criminal behavior found to be associated with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, live commercial nudity in general, and cinematographic or videographic adult entertainment are disorderly conduct, prostitution, public solicitation, public indecency, drug use and drug trafficking. Among the undesirable community conditions identified in other communities with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, commercial nudity in general, and cinematographic or videographic adult entertainment, are depression of property values and acceleration of community blight in the surrounding neighborhood, increased allocation of and expenditure for law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, and increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior herein above described. The mayor and council of the City of Snellville find it is reasonable to believe that some or all of these undesirable community conditions will result in the City of Snellville, as well. 
                  Furthermore, it is the finding of the mayor and council of the City of Snellville that other forms of adult entertainment including, but not limited to, adult book stores, adult novelty shops, adult video stores, peep shows, adult theaters, and massage parlors have an adverse effect upon the quality of life in surrounding communities. 
                  The mayor and council of the City of Snellville find that the negative secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments upon the City of Snellville are similar whether the adult entertainment establishment features live nude dancing or sells video tapes depicting sexual activities. In addition, Gwinnett County's experience with the adult bookstore located within the county has shown that a substantial amount of activity at the bookstore involves booths which an individual may enter, view videos depicting sexual activity, and sexually interact with a bookstore patron in an adjoining booth through a hole strategically placed in the wall of adjoining booths. 
                  The City of Snellville, Georgia, therefore finds that it is in the best interests of the health, welfare, safety and morals of the community and the preservation of its businesses, neighborhoods, and of houses of worship (religious institutions), schools, residential areas, public parks and children's daycare facilities to prevent or reduce the adverse impacts of adult entertainment establishments. Therefore, the mayor and council of the City of Snellville find that licensing and regulations are necessary for any adult entertainment establishment. The mayor and council of the City of Snellville find that these regulations promote the public welfare by furthering legitimate public and governmental interests, including but not limited to, reducing criminal activity and protecting against or eliminating undesirable community conditions and further find that such will not infringe upon the protected constitutional rights of freedom of speech or expression, which rights are expressly acknowledged herein. To that end, this article is hereby adopted.

                  It shall be unlawful for any person, association, partnership, or corporation to operate, engage in, conduct, or carry on, in or upon any premises within the city an adult entertainment establishment as defined in this article without first procuring an annual license to do so except as provided in section 10-48(b) when the planning and development director fails to approve or deny an application for an adult entertainment license within 30 days as required by this article. The issuance of such an annual license shall not be deemed to authorize, condone or make legal any activity thereunder if the same is deemed illegal or unlawful under the laws of the State of Georgia or the United States. No annual license for an adult entertainment establishment shall be issued by the city if the premises to be used also holds a license to sell alcoholic beverages or malt beverages and wine for consumption on the premises. Any premises licensed as an adult entertainment establishment shall not be eligible to apply at any time for a license to sell alcoholic beverages or malt beverages and wine for consumption on the premises. There shall be an annual regulatory fee for each adult entertainment establishment licensed within the city per the planning and development fee schedule. The annual regulatory fee must be paid to the planning and development department within ten days after the planning and development director approves the initial application for an adult entertainment establishment license or a renewal thereof. In any event, no adult entertainment establishment license or renewal thereof shall be issued until the most recent annual regulatory fee has been paid. All licenses granted hereunder shall expire on December 31 of each year. Licensees who desire to renew their license shall file an application with the planning and development department on the form provided for renewal of the license for the ensuing year. Applications for renewal must be filed before November 30 of each year. Any renewal application received after November 30 shall pay, in addition to said annual regulatory fee, a late charge of 20 percent. If a license renewal application is received after January 1, such application shall be treated as an initial application and the applicant shall be required to comply with all rules and regulations for the granting of licenses as if no previous license had been held. If a license application is received after January 1, investigative and administrative costs as hereinafter set forth in this article will be assessed. All licenses granted hereunder shall be for the calendar year and the full annual regulatory fee must be paid for a license renewal application filed prior to July 1 of the license year. One-half of a full annual regulatory fee shall be paid for a license renewal application filed after July 1 of the license year. Any person renewing any license issued hereunder who shall pay the annual regulatory fee, or any portion thereof, after January 1, shall, in addition to said annual regulatory fee and late charges, pay simple interest on the delinquent balance at the annual rate then charged by the Internal Revenue Service of the United States on unpaid federal income taxes.

               <p>                  ARTICLE I. - INTENT, PURPOSE, TITLE AND DEFINITIONS 

                  Sec. 19-1. - Intent. 
                  This chapter codified as articles I through IV, of the Code of Ordinances of the City of Snellville, Georgia, shall apply to all properties or portions thereof located within the City of Snellville, Georgia to the extent of the provisions contained herein. The mayor and city council hereby finds that the protection and preservation of trees, the planting of new trees and other landscape material, and the provision of buffers between properties of dissimilar uses as part of the land development process is a public purpose and provides for the public health and general welfare.

                  (a)  The purpose of this chapter is to preserve and enhance the City of Snellville's natural environment. This is accomplished through the preservation, protection and planting of trees and other landscape material, particularly those trees recognized herein as canopy and understory trees, and the provision of natural and/or planted buffers between properties of dissimilar uses as part of the land development process. The ordinance from which this chapter derives is intended to further the city's policy that all development sites where trees are most commonly removed will achieve upon project completion a uniform standard related to tree coverage, landscaping and buffers. In addition, trees are recognized for their importance in shading and cooling, noise and wind reduction, prevention of soil erosion, production of oxygen, dust infiltration, fostering air quality through carbon dioxide absorption, providing wildlife habitat, and contributing to the aesthetic and economic value of real property. 
                  (b)  This chapter is also intended to further the city's policy of encouraging all individuals or firms who propose to develop land, and which are required to meet the requirements of this chapter, to consider the use of water-efficient landscaping and techniques (xeriscaping).

                  Sec. 19-73. - Landscape strips. 
                  (a)  Minimum landscape strip dimensions for each lot are expressed in linear feet in the following chart. When a protected zone equivalent to the following landscape dimensions has not been left on a site in a non-single-family residential district, or when grading has occurred outside the buildable area on a lot, then landscape strips minimums must be provided as follows: 

                   
                  (b)  Within a single-family or duplex subdivision where street access to lots with frontage on more than one street is restricted according to section 5.5.2 of the development regulations, a ten-foot no access strip shall be required along the frontage of the street(s) with the higher classification. These no access strips shall be planted in accordance with the requirements for landscape strips as outlined in subsection (f) of this section. These no access strips shall be completed prior to the recording of the final plat. If the planting cannot be completed due to climatic or related conditions, the developer and/or owner shall enter into a performance surety agreement with the city agreeing to complete the strips within six months of the date of approval of the final plat. 
                  (c)  No permanent structures are permitted within landscape strips. 
                  (1)  This includes pavement, retaining walls, curbing, dumpsters, drainage structures, detention facilities, etc. The director may waive requirements herein as an administrative variance. 
                  (2)  The only exceptions to this rule are sidewalks and footpaths, when the width of the right-of-way is insufficient. 
                  (d)  Signs within landscape strips may only be located in areas of turf or groundcover and must not conflict with the growth potential of trees and shrubs. Signs are not permitted within required undisturbed buffers. 
                  (e)  The deposition of stormwater runoff into or drainage swales through landscape strips is not permitted. 
                  (1)  Exceptions will be considered by the director only if this standard will create an undue hardship to the property owner. Under no circumstance may the length of a drainage easement through a landscape strip exceed the width of the strip. 
                  (f)  Design standards. All required landscape strips shall be planted with a combination of trees, shrubs, perennials, groundcovers, and grass, as approved by the director. The landscape strips shall be designed with a minimum 40 percent coverage in trees and large shrubs (four feet × four feet or larger). Small shrubs, perennials, ornamental grasses, groundcover, and grass may constitute no more than 60 percent coverage of the landscape strip. All landscape strips along the public right-of-way shall be planted in a manner to achieve a two to three-foot tall evergreen screening buffer. Landscape strip coverage will be calculated as follows: 
                  (1)  Calculate the total spatial area of the landscape strip. 
                  (2)  Calculate the total coverage of landscape materials, ensuring that the coverage of trees and large shrubs is greater than or equal to 40 percent of the total area of the strip. The following sizes shall be used when calculating coverage of the landscape materials: 
                  a.  Trees greater than six-inch caliper: 100 square feet; 
                  b.  Trees less than six-inch caliper: 50 square feet; 
                  c.  Large shrubs: (four-foot height × four-foot spread or larger): 16 square feet; 
                  d.  Ornamental grasses: 12 square feet; 
                  e.  Small shrubs: Nine square feet; 
                  f.  Perennials: Six square feet. 
                  (3)  Any exposed ground should be planted with a groundcover or an appropriate mulching material. Mulching materials shall not exceed four-inches in height. 
                  (4)  Trees and shrubs required herein may be planted and spaced singly or in groups as authorized by the director so long as the total number of plantings is achieved. 
                  (5)  The remaining ground area shall be sodded, seeded or hydroseeded with grass, and/or planted with groundcover species and/or provided with other landscaping material, or any combination thereof. 
                  (g)  Trees within required landscape strips shall be provided as follows: 
                  (1)  Landscape strips shall have a minimum of one tree for every 50 linear feet of a landscape strip to the nearest whole number. 
                  (2)  Clumping is permitted provided that adequate spacing is allowed for future growth. 
                  (h)  Where desirable, the landscape strip need not be a strip per se or may be reduced to a width of five feet with the approval of the director. 
                  (i)  Curb stops must be used when parking perpendicular to five-foot landscape strip, or shrubs or trees adjacent to a landscape strip must set back a minimum of three feet from the edge of the curb. Creative alternatives are encouraged and must be approved by the director.

                  Sec. 19-74. - Parking areas. 
                  Parking lots designed for eight or more spaces shall be designed as follows: 
                  (1)  The planter islands may be sized according to two different options: 
                  a.  Each planter island shall be a minimum of 300 square feet. Planter islands shall be located at the terminus of each parking row and no further apart than every ten parking spaces. 
                  b.  Each planter island shall be a minimum of 200 square feet. Planter islands shall be located at the terminus of each parking row and no further apart than 25 parking spaces. Planting strips with a minimum width of five feet shall run continuously between all planter islands. These strips shall be planted with one overstory tree for every 30 linear feet of the strip. 
                  (2)  All planter islands must be designed with at least 60 percent coverage in trees in shrubs and no more than 40 percent coverage in groundcover and landscaping materials. Planter islands abutting double rows of parking shall include two overstory trees. Planter islands abutting single rows of parking shall include one overstory tree. No plant materials, with the exception of trees, shall exceed three feet in height. Turfgrass, however, shall not be planted in the required islands. The plans must be prepared by a registered landscape architect, architect or an engineer. 
                  (3)  All planter islands and landscape strips must be curbed to prevent vehicular encroachment. 
                  (4)  Planter islands and strips shall be designed to prevent compaction. This may be accomplished by planting a dense shrub cover or by elevating the planting area a minimum of one foot above the curb. 
                  (5)  Trees shall be planted in accordance with the details provided in appendix III-A(1). 
                  (Ord. No. ZOA 11-01, 6-13-2011) 
                  Sec. 19-75. - Street trees. 
                  Street trees are required in all residential districts. Street tree requirements are as follows: 
                  (1)  A street tree planting plan shall be submitted to and approved by the director prior to issuance of a development permit. The plan shall be prepared and sealed by a Georgia registered landscape architect, certified arborist, or Georgia registered forester. All proposed trees shall be individually located on the plan with an included species list. 
                  (2)  Street trees shall be planted in the right-of-way, in accordance with the details provided in appendix III-A(1). Street trees shall be planted no further than 50 feet apart and no closer than 25 feet from street intersections. It is not mandatory to plant street trees on each individual lot, where spacing distances are inadequate. Street trees are required on both sides of the street. The director may approve alternate spacing when the 50-foot spacing requirement cannot be met due to driveways and other improvements. 
                  (3)  Street tree species shall be selected in accordance with appendix IV1(B) and shall be subject to the approval of the director. No more than 35 percent of any one species shall be used throughout the development. 
                  (4)  Street trees shall have a minimum caliper of three inches. They shall be single-stemmed with a single, straight leader. Trees shall be located at least three feet from the back of the curb unless a modification is granted by the director. 
                  (5)  The builder shall install on each lot the street tree(s) specified on the street tree planting plan prior to the issuance of the certificate of occupancy. However, street tree plantings shall be delayed from May 1 through October 1. In this case, the builder shall enter into a performance surety agreement with the city guaranteeing tree planting by November 1. The performance surety agreement must be executed before the issuance of the certificate of occupancy for lots in this case. 
                  (6)  Impermeable rigid tree root barriers shall be installed in a linear method in all tree strips. The barriers shall be a minimum of 24 inches deep and include ribs to direct root growth downward. The root barriers shall be installed in accordance with the details provided in appendix III-A(2). 
                  (7)  Expandable plastic tree trunk protectors shall be installed on each tree. 
                  (8)  Street trees may count towards the minimum individual lot tree density requirements, as set forth in section 19-114 of article IV. 
                  (9)  Street trees shall be maintained by the property owner who owns the lot associated with the tree(s) and/or by the homeowners' association (HOA). Maintenance shall include, but is not limited to, watering, pruning, tree replacement and removal of leaves and litter from the sidewalks and street, as necessary. All maintenance may be in compliance with ANSI A300 standards for tree care. A maintenance responsibility statement shall be provided on the final plat. 
                  (Ord. No. ZOA 11-01, 6-13-2011) 
                  Sec. 19-76. - Tree density requirements. 
                  (a)  Tree density standards. On each property for which a tree preservation and/or replacement plan is required, existing trees shall be retained and new trees shall be planted such that the property shall attain or exceed a tree density standard of 16 tree density units per acre, exclusive of any acreage within a zoning buffer and any trees required to be preserved or planted within a zoning buffer and except any other land area is allowed to be excluded by this article. Trees, both existing and new, shall be reasonably distributed throughout the site, with emphasis on tree groupings to achieve aesthetic results following professional landscaping standards. Trees, including street trees, may be retained or planted for credit within a public street right-of-way if granted authorization by the director of planning and development and director of public works on the city public rights-of-way. 
                  (b)  Tree density standard calculation. The tree density standard shall be calculated by summing the following credits and dividing by the total acreage of the project included within the limits of the permit application (but excluding any acreage included within a zoning buffer and other land area allowed to be excluded by this article): 
                  (1)  Credit for existing trees proposed to be preserved on the site shall be calculated by multiplying the number of trees (by diameter) times the units assigned in Table A, Credit for Existing Trees. Credit shall be given to all trees preserved on a property having a diameter of three inches or more, except trees located in a required zoning buffer. 
                  (2)  Credit for new trees proposed to be replaced on the site shall be calculated by multiplying the number of trees (by diameter) times the units assigned in Table C, Credit for Replacement Trees. Credit shall be given for all new trees replaced on a property except for trees one inch or less in diameter and new trees planted in a required zoning buffer. Deciduous trees shall be a minimum of two inches in diameter and evergreen trees shall be a minimum of six feet in height. Multi-trunked trees shall only be given credit by measuring the single largest trunk and not the cumulative total of the various trunks. Tree-form shrubs shall not be given credit for satisfying the required tree density standards. 
                  (3)  Credit for specimen trees preserved on the site shall be calculated by multiplying the number of trees (by diameter) times the units assigned in Table B, Credit for Specimen Trees. Credit shall be given for all specimen trees preserved on a property except for those located on a property in a required zoning buffer where partial credit may be given. A specimen tree located within a buffer with a critical root zone extending beyond the buffer is allowed partial credit toward tree density units. The partial credit is based on the percentage of CRZ that is outside of the buffer. For example: Given a 30-inch specimen tree's CRZ extends by 20 percent over the buffer line then the credits are calculated as follows: Twenty percent credit for a 30-inch existing specimen tree (19.6 x .20 = 3.92 TDU's). 
                  To determine the percentage of CRZ outside of the buffer simply measure the area of the CRZ circle. Then measure the area of CRZ outside of the buffer. Divide the smaller number into the larger number and that is your percentage of CRZ. For example: Given a specimen tree's CRZ is 6,000 square feet is outside of the buffer. Divide 1,200 by 6,000 and the answer is .2. In other words, 20 percent of the CRZ is outside of the buffer. 
                  (4)  Additional credits shall be granted under the following circumstances: 
                  a.  For specimen trees see section 19-115 and article III, Table B, Credit for Specimen Trees. 
                  b.  Existing trees to be preserved within a minimum yard area (as required by the applicable zoning district) or within a 100-year floodplain shall be granted a bonus credit of 50 percent of the units assigned in Table A, Credit for Existing Trees, unless the tree is located within a required zoning buffer. 
                  c.  There shall be no more than 35 percent of any one genus of tree for the overall site. Provide all calculations on plan.

                  Sec. 19-77. - Tree canopy calculations. 
                  The tree canopy calculations are required for all new developments and existing developments adding any structural or site improvements. 
                  (1)  The tree canopy shall be calculated by assigning the square feet of canopy to each tree proposed and each tree preserved. Square feet of canopy can be found in appendix IV-(A) of article IV. Stands of three or more trees can be computed with polygons as given in terms of square feet. Include buffer trees, landscape strip trees, parking lot trees and any tree preserved or replaced. Add the total square feet of canopy. Take the total site acreage and convert that to square feet. Divide the total square feet of canopy into the total square feet for the site and list it as percentage. Provide calculations on the tree preservation/replacement plan. There is no minimum or maximum tree canopy percentage required at this time.

                  (e)  All perennials shall be one-gallon size or larger. 
                  (f)  Sod, rather than seed, shall be used in all landscape strips and no access strips that abut public right-of-way and shall extend to the curb of the public roadway. 
                  (g)  Sod, rather than seed, shall be used on all single-family residential lots and shall be installed in all areas designated for grass from the back of the curb to the front corner of all houses, at a minimum. 
                  (h)  All species must be ecologically compatible with the intended growing site. 
                  (i)  No more than 35 percent of any one tree or shrub species may be used. 
                  (j)  Evergreen trees may only be used in the interior and/or rear landscape strips. 
                  (k)  All plant materials are subject to the approval of the director.

                  Sec. 19-79. - Installation and maintenance. 
                  (a)  Installation. All landscaping shall be installed in a sound workman-like manner and according to accepted good planting procedures. The director shall inspect all landscaping and no certificate of occupancy or similar authorization will be issued unless the landscaping meets the requirements provided in this article. 
                  (b)  Staking and guying. Newly planted trees shall not be staked or guyed unless they are unable to stand upright without support. Materials used shall be flat, woven polypropylene photodegradable three-fourths-inch wide with 900 pound break strength. Any staking and guying materials used shall be removed within one year of installation. 
                  (c)  Irrigation. An irrigation system is encouraged to be installed in all landscape strips, planter islands, and no access strips, such as drip irrigation, gator bags and a combination of drip irrigation and water-efficient design or creative irrigation plan with the approval of the director. 
                  (d)  Water-efficient design consideration. It is the policy of the City of Snellville to encourage individuals or firms who prepare the plans and plats required by this chapter to consider the use of water-efficient landscaping principles and techniques as one of the criterion to be used in plant selection and design. 
                  (e)  Minimum space requirements. All trees planted shall be provided with adequate space to grow unobstructed to maturity, to avoid sight obstructions, and to provide clearance. The following includes the minimum requirements that must be met: 

                   
                  (f)  Maintenance. The owner, occupant, tenant and respective agent of each, if any, shall be jointly and severally responsible for the maintenance and protection of all required landscaping in perpetuity, in accordance with the following standards: 
                  (1)  Keep landscaping reasonably free of visible signs of insects and disease and appropriately irrigated to enable landscaping to exist in a healthy growing condition; 
                  (2)  Mow or trim landscaping in a manner and at a frequency appropriate to the use made of the material and species on the site so as not to detract from the appearance of the general area. Growth of plant material at maturity shall be considered where future conflicts such as view, signage, street lighting, utilities and circulation might arise; 
                  (3)  Maintain all landscaping to minimize property damage and public safety hazards, including removal of dead or decaying plant material, and removal of low hanging branches next to sidewalks and walkways obstructing street lighting; and 
                  (4)  All pruning may be done in accordance with ANSI A300 (Part 1) "Standards for Tree Care Operations—Pruning". Tree topping is not allowed. Crown reduction pruning shall be used instead to reduce the height of a tree when necessary. Topped trees shall not be counted toward tree density requirements.

                  The recommended principles and techniques to be considered are as follows: 
                  (1)  Proper location and design. Locating plants where they will naturally thrive and not require excessive water and maintenance to survive, as well as grouping plants by water needs, and limiting and concentrating high-water using plants. 
                  (2)  Turf selection. Limiting turf areas and selecting turf grasses that can survive the variable rainfall condition in this region. 
                  (3)  Efficient watering. Once plants are established, avoid watering during periods of normal rainfall and during droughts, watering every week to ten days or less depending on the drought tolerance of the plants. 
                  (4)  Soil improvements. Loosening and breaking up the soil beyond the immediate planting area to allow better water absorption and to promote deep roots. 
                  (5)  Mulching. Using mulch to hold moisture in the soil which helps maximize the benefits of watering as well as preventing weeds. 
                  (6)  Plant selection. Selecting plants native or suitable to the region according to their watering requirements and optimum locations. 
                  (7)  Maintenance. Maintaining the landscape to maximize water conservation such as increasing mowing heights and avoiding fertilizing during dry spells.

                  The developer or owner shall post a performance bond or cash escrow guaranteeing all landscaping materials and work for a period of two years after the approval or acceptance thereof by the city. The bond or cash escrow will be required for commercial developments prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. A maintenance bond or cash escrow shall be required for residential developments at the time of recording of the final plat, or the completion of the planting (if planted after the recording of the final plat). A maintenance bond will be required for any street trees that are planted by the builder after the final plat has been recorded. Said bond shall be provided by the builder or the developer prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. 
                  (1)  The bond will be in the amount of 125 percent of the estimated cost of replacing all of the required landscaping.

                  Sec. 19-113. - Removal of trees. 
                  (a)  Trees are not to be removed in any protected zone. When preserving trees in a protected zone will result in a documented economic hardship, an exception may be made. The documentation proving the hardship shall be submitted to the planning director as part of the tree protection plan. Nothing in these regulations shall be construed to allow the removal of vegetation in a natural, undisturbed buffer required by zoning regulations. No removal may be initiated prior to a request for removal being approved by the planning director. 
                  (b)  The removal of dead, diseased, insect-infested, or hazard trees is exempt from the provisions of this article provided the property owner can provide documentation of the condition of said trees. Documentation includes, but is not limited to, photographs and a report by a certified arborist and shall be submitted to the Planning Director prior to removal. No removal may be initiated prior to a request for removal being approved by the planning director. 
                  (c)  When no trees are present in the protected zone or when it is proposed that any portion of the protected zone be disturbed, it shall be the responsibility of the owner/developer to landscape said areas (where improvements are not constructed), with trees or other plant materials subject to zoning regulations. 
                  (d)  Trees shall not be removed from any buffer area and/or floodplain except as follows: 
                  (1)  Those trees found to be dead, diseased, or insect-infested by the director, the county extension service, the Georgia Forestry Commission, or a registered forester. No removal may be initiated prior to a request for removal being approved by the planning director. 
                  (2)  As necessary for construction, repair, or maintenance of public roads, utilities or drainage structures. No removal may be initiated prior to a request for removal being approved by the planning director. 
                  (ZOA 11-01, 6-13-2011; Ord. No. 2017-17, § 1, 7-24-2017) 
                  Sec. 19-114. - Tree replacement; revegetation. 
                  (a)  The replacement of trees in the minimum required landscape areas, as determined by this article, must occur under the following conditions: 
                  (1)  To establish the minimum tree density requirements for the site. 
                  (2)  Where grading occurs outside the buildable area of the lot. 
                  (3)  If the buildable area of the lot leaves no protected zone. 
                  (4)  If no trees are present within an existing protected zone. 
                  (5)  Where specimen trees or specimen stands of trees within the buildable portion of the lot are to be removed. 
                  (6)  Where specimen trees or specimen stands of trees, and trees within otherwise designated tree-protective zones have been irreparably damaged or removed through development or construction activities. 
                  (b)  The quantity of replacement trees into a site must be sufficient so as to produce a total site tree density factor of no less than 16 units per acre (Note: the terms unit and tree are not interchangeable). Procedures for determining the site density requirements and the subsequent tree replacement requirements are incorporated by reference herein. Trees located in any buffer area, wetlands, and/or floodplain shall not be counted towards tree density. Trees located in stream buffer can be counted for up to 50 percent towards tree density. 
                  (c)  The following number of trees shall be maintained and/or planted on all single-family residential lots developed in the city: 

                   
                  (1)  Understory trees may constitute no more than 25 percent of the required trees; lots less than 8,000 square feet are exempt from this requirement. 
                  (2)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is required that all reasonable efforts be made to save specimen trees. (Reasonable effort shall include, but not be limited to, alternate building design, building location, parking area layout, parking area location, water retention location and the like.) 
                  (3)  Tree save areas are encouraged and will be given credit of up to 50 percent of the individual lot requirements when the number of trees in the tree save areas is equal to or greater than the total number of trees required on the total number of lots within the subdivision. 
                  (d)  The spacing of replacement trees must be compatible with spatial limitations and within responsible considerations towards potential species size. 
                  (e)  Occasionally, this intent cannot be met because a project site will not bear the required density of trees. In this case, the director may approve a contribution to the City of Snellville Tree Replacement Fund. The following standards have been established for administering these contributions and fund: 
                  (1)  The director must review and approve all requests for alternative compliance. In no instance shall 100 percent of the required site density be met through alternative compliance. As many trees as can reasonably be expected to survive must be planted on the site in question. 
                  (2)  No permit shall be issued until the required contribution has been made to the tree replacement fund. 
                  (3)  The amount of the contribution shall be determined from the fee schedule for the planning and development department. 
                  (4)  The City of Snellville Tree Replacement Fund shall be used for planting trees on public property. Funds may be used for the purchase of trees, installation of trees, shrubs, and irrigation, and the purchase of mulch and soil amendments for the planted areas. 
                  (f)  Species selected for replacement must be quality specimens, and must be ecologically compatible with the specifically intended growing site. No more than 35 percent of any one species may be used. Evergreens may constitute no more than 25 percent of the trees in nonbuffer areas. Standards for transplanting, and selecting quality replacement stock may be in accordance with standards of the International Society of Arboriculture, National Association of Arborists, American Standard for Nursery Stock offers a list of trees generally acceptable for credit in the tree density calculation. 
                  (g)  Understory replacement trees may account for no greater than 25 percent of the required tree density units. The director shall have the discretion to approve the additional use of understory trees for meeting density requirements on single-family lots if the size and/or layout of the lot does not allow for large overstory trees. 
                  (h)  Species selection and replacement densities are subject to approval by the director. 
                  (ZOA 11-01, 6-13-2011) 
                  Sec. 19-115. - Specimen and special trees. 
                  (a)  Some trees on a site warrant special consideration and encouragement for preservation. These trees are referred to as specimen or special trees. The following criteria are used to identify specimen and special trees. Both the size and condition must be met for a tree to qualify. A specimen tree survey plan is required to be submitted with the concept/site plan and shall be prepared by a certified arborist, authorized registered professional or urban forester. Any tree that meets the following both criteria is considered a specimen tree and shall be shown on the specimen tree survey plan: 

                   
                  Condition criteria: 
                  Relatively sound and solid trunk with no extensive decay. 
                  No more than one major and several minor dead limbs. 
                  No major insect or pathological problems. 
                  No major pruning deficiencies, i.e., topping. 
                  A life expectancy of greater than ten years. 
                  At least 75 percent of the critical root zone in a natural, undisturbed state. 
                  Exceptional quality. 
                  Of historical significance. 
                  (b)  In order to encourage the preservation of specimen and special trees and the incorporation of these trees into the design of projects, additional density credit will be given for specimen and special trees which are successfully saved and maintained. Credit for any specimen or special tree thus saved would be 1.5 times the assigned unit value shown in Table B of article III. Should the property owner retain the services of a certified arborist to improve the quality of said trees (services include, but are not limited to, installation of cabling and bracing, installation of lightning protection, corrective pruning, removal of deadwood, supplemental irrigation, introduction of mycorrhizae, etc.), the density credit shall be increased to two times the assigned value designated in Table B of article III. The property owner must supply a letter of commitment from the certified arborist and/or provide documentation of services provided in order to receive the increased density credit. 
                  (1)  The director may identify and require the preservation of a tree stand if it contains one or more specimen or special trees and the trees are interlocked with other members of the stand in such a manner as to imperil the individual tree if other members of the stand were to be removed. 
                  (2)  No specimen tree may be removed without the prior written approval of the director. 
                  a.  Specimen trees that are approved for removal must be replaced by species with potential for comparable size and quality. All specimen trees must be replaced with three-inch caliper or larger trees at a density of 1.5 times the unit value of the tree removed, i.e., a 30-inch DBH specimen tree (4.9 density units) must be replaced with 7.35 units. Specimen tree replacement density is in addition to the minimum required density for the site. 
                  b.  Any specimen tree, which is fatally damaged during construction, as determined by the director, or removed without the appropriate review and approval of the director, must be replaced with four-inch caliper or larger trees with a total density equal to three times the unit value of the tree removed. Size alone will determine whether a tree was of specimen quality if the tree is removed without approval. Additionally, the area that encompassed the critical root zone of the specimen tree shall remain undisturbed to allow for the planting of replacement trees.

                  Sec. 19-116. - Tree protection. 
                  (a)  The following minimum tree protection measures must be in place for all tree save areas: 
                  (1)  Trees identified for preservation shall have protection fencing that is a minimum of four feet high installed at the edge of the critical root zones. The director shall have the discretion to require the installation of four-foot high minimum chain link fencing in those areas where the likelihood of possible encroachment occurs. All tree protection zones shall be designated as such with signage posted visibly on all sides of the fenced area. Signs requesting workers' cooperation and compliance with tree protection standards are recommended at the site entrance(s). 
                  (2)  All tree protection zones shall be designed to prevent the sedimentation of erosion material. Silt fences must be placed along the outer uphill edges of tree protection zones at the development interface. 
                  (3)  No person shall encroach into the tree protection zones. Construction activities, including but not limited to, parking, vehicle and foot traffic, material storage, concrete washout, debris burning, and other activities shall be arranged so as to prevent disturbance within the protected areas. 
                  (4)  Reasonable efforts shall be made to locate utility lines along corridors between tree protection zones. If utility lines must encroach into the protection zones, they shall be installed by tunneling rather than trenching. 
                  (5)  All tree protection devices shall remain in fully functioning condition until the certificate of occupancy is issued. 
                  (6)  Any tree, designated for preservation, which is negligently damaged during construction or removed without the appropriate review and approval, as determined by the director, shall be treated according to the National Arborists Association Standards. If fatally damaged, the tree(s) shall be replaced with four-inch caliper trees equal to the unit value of the tree removed. Any specimen tree damaged as described above shall be replaced with trees equal to three times the unit value of the tree removed. 
                  (7)  All tree protection zones shall be mulched with at least four inches and not more than eight inches of organic mulch, such as pine straw, wood chips, tree leaves or compost. 
                  (8)  There shall be no construction activity inside the tree save areas, including but not limited to, grading, paving and construction of buildings and other structures. 
                  (9)  The site shall be designed and maintained in a manner to ensure proper drainage in tree save areas during and after construction. 
                  (b)  Tree protection inspections shall be performed by a certified arborist, registered forester, urban forester or director or his/her designee during construction. The inspections shall be conducted prior to the commencement of development, immediately following the clearing and grubbing phase, immediately following the grading phase, and at the end of the project before a certificate of occupancy (commercial developments) is issued or the final plat approved (residential developments). The site shall be inspected to ensure all tree protection regulations are being met and to identify any existing or developing tree-related problems that require treatment. An inspection report shall be prepared and certified by the inspector and submitted to the director. Any damage noted shall be treated according to the recommendation of the inspector prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy or approval of the final plat. The director shall have the authority to require additional reports should he/she determine significant construction damage has occurred, the tree protection supervisor has failed to enforce minimum protection standards, or if other development processes, including but not limited to utility placement and building construction, may impact the tree save areas.

                  All maintenance activities performed on preserved or planted trees to be included in the tree density requirements shall be performed according to the most current professional standards, including, but not limited to, the standards described below. It shall be the responsibility of the property owner to ensure such work is in compliance. Should maintenance activities on said trees not be in compliance with such professional standards, the property owner will be responsible for replacing the damaged or dead trees with new trees of an equivalent density value, based on the DBH at the time damage occurs. 
                  (1)  Nursery stock: All nursery stock shall meet standards defined in the American Standard for Nursery Stock ANSI Z60.1. 
                  (2)  Pruning: All pruning shall be done in accordance with ANSI A300 (Part 1) Standards for Tree Care Operations—Pruning. Tree topping is not allowed. Crown reduction pruning shall be used instead to reduce the height of a tree when necessary. Topped trees shall not be counted toward tree density requirements. 
                  (3)  Fertilization: All tree fertilization shall be performed in accordance with ANSI A 300 (Part 2) Standards for Tree Care Operations—Fertilization.

                  APPENDIX IV-A(1). - SUBSTANTIAL BUILDING PERMIT 
                  (a)  Example one: 
                  (1)  The 100 percent assessed value of the improvements of a 10,000 square foot shopping center is assessed by Gwinnett County at $250,000.00. 
                  (2)  In January the owner is issued a permit in the amount of $25,000.00 to replace heating and air conditioning equipment. Three months later he is issued a permit in the amount of $50,000.00 to replace the roof covering and add a false mansard roof. 
                  (3)  Does this equate to a substantial building permit? 
                  Analysis:  $25,000.00 + $50,000.00 = $75,000.00 (building permits 12 months)  $75,000/$250,000 = 30 percent of assessed value 
                  Conclusion:  No, this case is not a substantial building permit. 
                  (b)  Example two: 
                  (1)  The 100 percent assessed value of the improvements of 10,000 square feet shopping center is assessed by Gwinnett County at $250,000.00. 
                  (2)  The owner decides to build phase two of the shopping center, which includes an additional 6,000 square feet of space. The low bid on the job is $260,000.00. 
                  (3)  Does this equate to a substantial building permit? 
                  Analysis:  $260,000.00 (building permit est. cost of construction)  $260,000.00/$250,000.00 = 104 percent of assessed value 
                  Conclusion:  Yes, this case is a substantial building permit. 
                  (c)  Example three: 
                  (1)  A site is cleared and graded for a gas station but not developed, therefore the county's assessed value of the improvements is $0. 
                  (2)  Two years later the owner applies for a building permit in the amount of $500,000.00 for the construction of a gas station. 
                  (3)  Does this equate to a substantial building permit? 
                  ANALYSIS: $500,000.00 (building permit est. cost of construction) 
                  CONCLUSION: Yes, this case is a substantial building permit.

                  Sec. 22-31. - Definitions. 
                  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:

                  Cancellation shall mean the process where response is terminated when the alarm company (designated by the alarm user) notifies the Snellville Police Department that there is not an existing situation at the alarm site requiring police response after an alarm dispatch request. If cancellation occurs prior to police arriving at the scene, this is not a false alarm for the purpose of civil penalty, and no penalty will be assessed.

                  False alarm shall mean the activation of an alarm system through mechanical or electronic failure, malfunction, improper installation, or the negligence of the alarm user, his/her employees or agents, and signals activated to summon law enforcement personnel unless law enforcement response was cancelled by the alarm user or his/her agent before law enforcement personnel arrive at the alarm location. An alarm is false within the meaning of this article when, upon inspection by the Snellville Police Department, evidence indicates that no unauthorized entry, robbery, or other such crime was committed or attempted in or on the premises which would have activated a properly functioning alarm system.

Control panels built and tested to this standard by a nationally recognized testing organization, will be marked to state: "Design evaluated in accordance with SIA CP-01 Control Panel Standard Features for False Alarm Reduction". 
                  Verify shall mean an attempt by the monitoring company, or its representative, to contact the alarm site and/or alarm user by telephone and/or other electronic means, whether or not actual contact with a person is made, to attempt to determine whether an alarm signal is valid before requesting law enforcement dispatch, in an attempt to avoid an unnecessary alarm dispatch request. For the purpose of this article, telephone verification shall require, as a minimum that a second call be made to a different number if the first attempt fails to reach an alarm user who can properly identify themselves to attempt to determine whether an alarm signal is valid before requesting law enforcement dispatch.

                  (d)  Reporting updated information. Whenever the information provided on the alarm permit application changes, the alarm user shall provide correct information to the city within 30 days of the change. In addition, each year after the issuance of the permit, permit holders will receive from the city a form requesting updated information. The permit holder shall complete and return this form to the city when any of the requested information has changed; failure to comply will constitute a violation and may result in a civil penalty. 
                  (e)  Multiple alarm systems. If an alarm user has one or more alarm systems protecting two or more separate structures having different addresses and/or tenants, a separate permit shall be required for each structure and/or tenant.

The application shall contain the full name, address, phone number, date of birth, photograph, and Social Security Number of all persons, including pawnbrokers and employees, having any interest in the proposed business, plus any additional information, including fingerprints, deemed necessary by the planning and development director and/or the chief of police.

                  Sec. 22-55. - Regulation as to employees and managers. 
                  (a)  No person shall be employed by a pawnshop in any capacity until such person is found to be in compliance with the qualifications as described in this section and has paid the fee listed in the Snellville Police Department's Fee Schedule for a pawnshop work permit ID card, as approved by the mayor and council. This provision applies to all persons having any interest in the proposed business including each owner, employee, and manager. Upon complying with the requirements of this chapter, a work permit ID card, authorizing such person to be a pawnshop employee will be issued. The work permit ID card will expire annually, and each holder will be required to renew the work permit ID card annually on or before the date of expiration. All persons having any interest in the proposed business including each owner, employee, manager, and pawnbroker shall while on the pawnshop premises, have in their possession and available for inspection such work permit ID card. It shall be the duty of the pawnbroker to insure compliance with the provisions of this section. 
                  (b)  The following qualifications shall apply to all persons having any interest in the proposed business including each owner, employee and manager: 
                  (1)  No work permit ID card shall be issued until such time as a signed application has been filed with the Snellville Police Department, the chief of police or his designee and a search of the criminal record of the person completed. Such application shall include the applicant's name, fingerprints, Social Security Number, date of birth, and prior arrest record; though an applicant's arrest record shall be used for investigative purposes only and shall not give rise to a presumption or inference of guilt. Applicant must also provide positive identification (only official government issued pictured identification accepted, e.g., driver's license, passport, military card, or state identification card). 
                  (2)  The chief of police or his designee shall conduct a complete and exhaustive search relative to any police record of the applicant. 
                  (3)  In the event the applicant is qualified for employment in a pawnshop under this section and there is no record of a violation of this chapter, the chief of police or his designee shall issue a work permit ID card to the applicant, by mail, stating that the person is eligible for employment. If it is found that the person is not qualified for a permit and therefore ineligible for employment in a pawnshop, the chief of police or his designee shall notify the person in writing that they are not eligible for employment, the cause of such denial, and their right to appeal. 
                  (4)  No person who has been convicted or pled guilty or entered a plea of nolo contendere to any crime involving moral turpitude, illegal gambling, or any felonies, or any crime involving theft or fraudulent practices shall be issued a work permit ID card for the five years preceding the date of application. For purposes of this chapter, a conviction or plea of guilt or nolo contendere entered under the Georgia First Offender Act, O.C.G.A. § 42-8-60 et seq., shall be ignored. Provided, however, that any such offense shall not be ignored where the defendant violated any term of probation imposed by the court granting first offender status or committed another crime and the sentencing court entered an adjudication of guilt as to the crime for which the defendant had previously been sentenced as a first offender. 
                  (5)  No person shall be issued a work permit ID card if it is determined that the person falsified, concealed, or misrepresented any material fact by any device, trick, or scheme while making application to the Snellville Police Department for said permit under this section. 
                  (6)  All work permit ID cards issued through administrative error can be terminated and seized by the chief of police or his designee or the planning and development director or his designee. 
                  (7)  Replacement work permit ID cards will be issued within 30 days of original date, upon paying one-half of the fees charged for work permit ID cards in subsection 22-55(a). After 30 days of original application date, a new application and fee must be submitted. 
                  (8)  All work permit ID cards issued hereunder remain the property of the Snellville Police Department, and shall be produced for inspection upon the demand of any officer or designee of the Snellville Police Department. 
                  (9)  No pawnshop owner shall allow any employee or manager to work on the premises unless the employee or manager has in their possession a current valid work permit ID card. Pawnshop owners are required by this chapter to inspect and verify that each employee or manager has in their possession a valid current work permit ID card. For new employees, a receipt issued by the Snellville Police Department may be used for a maximum of 30 days from the date of issue. Issuance of this fee receipt shall allow the applicant to work in the position applied for only until such time as the required criminal history background investigation is completed. The temporary privilege conferred by issuance of this fee receipt shall expire immediately upon completion of such background investigation. If the background investigation indicates that the applicant does not meet the requirements for issuance of a work permit ID card, the applicant may appeal the denial of the work permit ID card as provided in this chapter. However, issuance of this fee receipt and the temporary privilege granted thereby shall not be construed as conferring any right or privilege to the applicant to continue working in the position for which the work permit ID card sought during the pendency of the appeal from the denial of a work permit ID card under this chapter. 
                  (10)  If it is determined that any person issued a work permit ID card has falsified, concealed, or misrepresented any material fact by any device, trick, or scheme in the application for the work permit ID card such work permit ID card shall be revoked or canceled. 
                  (11)  Snellville employees who are directly involved in the issuance of work permit ID cards or in the regulation of pawnshops shall not be eligible for a work permit ID card.

The planning and development director, at his/her discretion, may waive or reduce the filing fee amount if it is determined the fee would create a hardship on the individual filing such appeal. The board of appeals may, at the request of the appellant, refund the filing fee by a majority vote. 
                  (2)  A hearing shall be conducted on each appeal within 30 days of the date of filing with the planning and development director unless a continuance of such date is agreed to by the appellant and the planning and development director. The appellant at such hearing shall have the right to be represented by an attorney, at the expense of the appellant, and to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.

                  a.  Contrary to law or ordinances; or 
                  b.  Unsupported by substantial evidence on the records as a whole; or 
                  c.  Unreasonable.

                  (b)  The planning and development director shall revoke the certificate for any premises where goods are pawned during a period of suspension. 
                  (c)  The planning and development director may suspend or revoke the certificate of any establishment which does not meet the qualifications set forth in this chapter any time such knowledge becomes known to him/her. 
                  (d)  An act or omission of a certificate holder, owner of more than 20 percent interest in the establishment, or employee of the certificate holder or establishment willingly or knowingly performed, which constitutes a violation of federal or state law or of any provision of this chapter will subject the certificate holder to suspension or revocation of its certificate in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, when the planning and development director determines to his own satisfaction that the act or omission did occur, regardless of whether any criminal prosecution or conviction ensues. Provided, however, in the case of an employee, the planning and development director or his designee must determine that the acts of the employee were known to or under reasonable circumstances should have been known to the certificate holder, were condoned by the certificate holder, or where the certificate holder has not established practices or procedures to prevent the violation from occurring.

                  c.  Impact of the offense on the community. 
                  d.  Any mitigating circumstances or remedial or corrective steps taken by certificate holder.

                  (c)  The Snellville Police Department has the authority to place property that is the subject of police investigation on "police hold."

                  Sec. 22-74. - Regulation as to employees and managers. 
                  (a)  No person shall be employed by a precious metals dealer in any capacity until such person is found to be in compliance with the qualifications as described in this section and has paid the fee listed in the Snellville Police Department's Fee Schedule for a precious metals dealer work permit ID card, as approved by the mayor and council. This provision applies to all persons having any interest in the proposed business including each owner, employee, and manager. Upon complying with the requirements of this chapter, a work permit ID card, authorizing such person to be a precious metals dealer employee will be issued.

                  (1)  No work permit ID card shall be issued until such time as a signed application has been filed with the Snellville Police Department, Chief of Police or his designee and a search of the criminal record of the person completed. Such application shall include the applicant's name, fingerprints, Social Security Number, date of birth, and prior arrest record; though an applicant's arrest record shall be used for investigative purposes only and shall not give rise to a presumption or inference of guilt. Applicant must also provide positive identification (only official government issued pictured identification accepted, e.g., driver's license, passport, military card, or state identification card). 
                  (2)  The chief of police or his designee shall conduct a complete and exhaustive search relative to any police record of the applicant. 
                  (3)  In the event the applicant is qualified for employment in a precious metals dealer under this section and there is no record of a violation of this chapter, the chief of police or his designee shall issue a work permit ID card to the applicant, by mail, stating that the person is eligible for employment. If it is found that the person is not qualified for a work permit ID card and therefore ineligible for employment in a precious metals dealer, the chief of police or his designee shall notify the person in writing that they are not eligible for employment, the cause of such denial, and their right to appeal. 
                  (4)  No person who has been convicted or pled guilty or entered a plea of nolo contendere to any crime involving moral turpitude, illegal gambling, or any felonies, or any crime involving theft or fraudulent practices shall be issued a work permit ID card for the five years preceding the date of application. For purposes of this article, a conviction or plea of guilt or nolo contendere entered under the Georgia First Offender Act, O.C.G.A. § 42-8-60 et seq., shall be ignored. Provided, however, that any such offense shall not be ignored where the defendant violated any term of probation imposed by the court granting first offender status or committed another crime and the sentencing court entered an adjudication of guilt as to the crime for which the defendant had previously been sentenced as a first offender. 
                  (5)  No person shall be issued a work permit ID card if it is determined that the person falsified, concealed, or misrepresented any material fact by any device, trick, or scheme while making application to the Snellville Police Department for said permit under this section. 
                  (6)  All work permit ID cards issued through administrative error can be terminated and seized by the chief of police or his designee or the planning and development director or his designee. 
                  (7)  Replacement work permit ID cards will be issued within 30 days of original date, upon paying one-half of the fees charged for work permit ID cards in subsection 22-74(a). After 30 days of original application date, a new application and fee must be submitted. 
                  (8)  All work permit ID cards issued hereunder remain the property of the Snellville Police Department, and shall be produced for inspection upon the demand of any officer or designee of the Snellville Police Department. 
                  (9)  No precious metals dealer owner shall allow any employee or manager to work on the premises unless the employee or manager has in their possession a current valid work permit ID card. Precious metals dealer owners are required by this chapter to inspect and verify that each employee or manager has in their possession a valid current work permit ID card. For new employees, a receipt issued by the Snellville Police Department unit may be used for a maximum of 30 days from the date of issue. Issuance of this fee receipt shall allow the applicant to work in the position applied for only until such time as the required criminal history background investigation is completed. The temporary privilege conferred by issuance of this fee receipt shall expire immediately upon completion of such background investigation. If the background investigation indicates that the applicant does not meet the requirements for issuance of a work permit ID card, the applicant may appeal the denial of the work permit ID card as provided in this chapter. However, issuance of this fee receipt and the temporary privilege granted thereby shall not be construed as conferring any right or privilege to the applicant to continue working in the position for which the work permit ID card sought during the pendency of the appeal from the denial of a work permit ID card under this chapter. 
                  (10)  If it is determined that any person issued a work permit ID card has falsified, concealed, or misrepresented any material fact by any device, trick, or scheme in the application for the work permit ID card such work permit ID card shall be revoked or canceled. 
                  (11)  Snellville employees who are directly involved in the issuance of work permit ID card or in the regulation of precious metals dealer shall not be eligible for a work permit ID card.

Any applicant who is aggrieved or adversely affected by a final action of the chief of police may have a review thereof by appeal to the board of appeals established pursuant to the Charter of the City of Snellville. 
                  Such appeal shall be by written petition, filed in the office of the planning and development director within 15 days after the final order or action of the chief of police and in order to defray administrative costs, must be accompanied by the filing fee listed in the department of planning and development's fee schedule under applications for board of appeals variance, waiver, appeal.

                  Sec. 26-39. - Inspection and right-of-entry. 
                  Upon presentation of planning and development director or his/her designee identification to the developer, contractor, owner, owner's agent, operator or occupants, employees of the planning and development department may enter, during all reasonable hours, any property under proposed or existing development and construction. Such employees of the planning and development department may make inspections of the facilities for the purpose of determining plan requirements or compliance with ordinance provisions. The planning and development director or his/her designee may inspect any drainage system within or outside of an existing drainage easement. All drainage facilities located on private property, whether dedicated to the city or not, shall be accessible at all times for city inspection. When drainage facilities are accepted by the city for maintenance, public access easements shall be provided. Reasonable access shall be provided to all drainage easements for inspection and maintenance functions. When an easement does not exist for the drainage system, the permission of the owner shall be obtained before entrance; however, if emergency maintenance is required, permission of the owner shall not be mandatory before entrance. 
                  In the event the owner objects to the inspection of the planning director, the planning director shall make or cause to be made inspections to determine the conditions of all structures and premises to safeguard the public health, safety and welfare under the provisions of this chapter. If the planning director develops probable cause that the property maintenance code has been violated, the planning director or a designee of the planning director may obtain an administrative search warrant or other authorization from the municipal court or other court of proper jurisdiction to enter the premises and conduct the necessary and authorized search. Such search warrant shall be requested from a court upon the submission of any photographs obtained from public property or neighboring property, an affidavit supporting a reason to believe a violation exists of this property maintenance code or building or zoning code, and/or any other supporting evidence justifying the issuance of the search warrant in compliance with Fourth Amendment requirements. If an owner, tenant, or other person in control of the property voluntarily allows entry in to the property, no such warrant shall be necessary. The inspection shall be limited to areas and purposes authorized by the person in control of the premises or the administrative search warrant. The ordinance codified herein shall not be construed to require or authorize inspections where there is no cause to believe a violation exists. Abandoned structures and lots shall be subject to unrestricted, complete and thorough code inspections, including legal right of entry into those structures found unsecured.

                  Sec. 26-41. - Notice of violation. 
                  Whenever the planning and development director or his/her designee determines that activity on a property does not comply with the approved development and construction plans, or that the drainage system has been unlawfully altered, causing inadequate drainage, he may issue a notice of violation. The notice of violation of the provisions of this chapter, or of any rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto, shall be to the owner of the property or his agent and shall: 
                  (1)  Be in writing; 
                  (2)  Include a description of the property sufficient for identification of where the violation has occurred; 
                  (3)  List the specific provisions of this chapter that have been violated; and 
                  (4)  State that, if the repairs, construction or alterations are not completed within a reasonable time period specified by the planning and development director or his/her designee, a summons shall be issued for the owner to appear in municipal court. 
                  Each day that a violation continues shall constitute a new and separate violation. However, in the judgement of the planning and development director or his/her designee, when a violation is willful, in wanton disregard of the provisions of this chapter or constitutes a public health and safety hazard, the planning and development director or his/her designee may issue a court summons in lieu of a notice of violation.

                  It is declared to be public policy to: 
                  (1)  Recognize the desirability of joint action, under some circumstances, by the city and the property owner in resolution of existing drainage problems and prevention of worsening or recurrence of such problems; 
                  (2)  Work in a cooperative relationship with the development industry to accomplish the objective set forth in subsection (1) of this section by encouraging, through this chapter and other public actions, the incremental resolution of existing drainage problems on a priority basis in concert with private development activities; 
                  (3)  Maintain, when feasible, the natural environment of city streams through reduction of flow quantities resulting from new development and, when feasible, restore the floodplain to its natural functional purpose to resolve existing flooding problems, but recognize the necessity of using urban streams for stormwater runoff in those situations when maintenance of the natural stream environment would result in continuation or worsening of flooding conditions; 
                  (4)  Assume maintenance responsibility for the public drainage system; 
                  (5)  Encourage the construction of joint retention ponds serving several properties. The city supports, when engineering judgement so warrants, the location of such retention facilities off the site of the property under development; 
                  (6)  Encourage innovative design solutions to the effective retention of runoff. Drainage control measures to retain and regulate the rate of stormwater discharge which shall be acceptable shall include, but are not limited to, retention ponds, retention on flat roofs, and parking lots, streets, open space areas and underground storage.

                  (1)  Surface mining as defined in O.C.G.A. § 12-4-72, "The Georgia Surface Mining Act of 1968". 
                  (2)  Granite quarrying and land clearing for such quarrying; 
                  (3)  Such minor land-disturbing activities as home gardens and individual home landscaping, repairs, maintenance work, fences, and other related activities, which result in minor soil erosion. 
                  (4)  The construction of single-family residences when such construction disturbs less than one acre and is not a part of a larger common plan of development or sale with a planned disturbance of equal to or greater than one acre and not otherwise exempted under this paragraph; provided, however, that construction of any such residence shall conform to the minimum requirements as set forth in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 and this paragraph. For single-family residence construction covered by the provisions of this paragraph, there shall be a buffer zone between the residence and any state waters classified as trout streams pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of the Georgia Water Quality Control Act. In any such buffer zone, no land-disturbing activity shall be constructed between the residence and the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action from the banks of the trout waters. For primary trout waters, the buffer zone shall be at least 50 horizontal feet, and no variance to a smaller buffer shall be granted. For secondary trout waters, the buffer zone shall be at least 50 horizontal feet, but the director may grant variances to no less than 25 feet. Regardless of whether a trout stream is primary or secondary, for first order trout waters, which are streams into which no other streams flow except for springs, the buffer shall be at least 25 horizontal feet, and no variance to a smaller buffer shall be granted. The minimum requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b) and the buffer zones provided by this paragraph shall be enforced by the local issuing authority. 
                  (5)  Agricultural operations as defined in O.C.G.A. § 1-3-3, definitions to include: 
                  a.  Raising, harvesting or storing of products of the field or orchard; 
                  b.  Feeding, breeding or managing livestock or poultry; 
                  c.  Producing or storing feed for use in the production of livestock, including, but not limited to, cattle, calves, swine, hogs, goats, sheep and rabbits, or for use in the production of poultry, including, but not limited to, chickens, hens and turkeys; 
                  d.  Producing plants, trees, fowl or animals; and 
                  e.  The production of aqua culture, horticultural, dairy, livestock, poultry, eggs and apiarian products, farm buildings, and farm ponds. 
                  (6)  Forestry land management practices, including harvesting; provided, however, that when such exempt forestry practices cause or result in land disturbing or other activities otherwise prohibited in a buffer, as established in subsections 26-423(15) and (16) of this article, no other land disturbing activities, except for normal forest management practices, shall be allowed on the entire property upon which the forestry practices were conducted for a period of three years after completion of such forestry practices. 
                  (7)  Any project carried out under the technical supervision of the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) United States Department of Agriculture. 
                  (8)  Any project involving less than one acre of disturbed area; provided, however, that this exemption shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity within a larger common plan of development or sale with a planned disturbance of equal to or greater than one acre or within 200 feet of the bank of any state waters. For the purposes of this subsection, the term "state waters" excludes channels and drainage ways that have water in them only during and immediately after rainfall events and intermittent streams which do not have water in them year-round; provided, however, that any person responsible for a project which involves less than one acre, which involves land-disturbing activity, and which is within 200 feet of any such excluded channel or drainage way, must prevent sediment from moving beyond the boundaries of the property on which such project is located. Nothing contained herein shall prevent the local issuing authority from regulating any such project which is not specifically exempted by subsections (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (9) or (10) of this section. 
                  (9)  Construction or maintenance projects, or both, undertaken or financed in whole or in part, or both, by the department of transportation, the Georgia Highway Authority, or the state road and tollway authority; or any road construction or maintenance project, or both, undertaken by any county or municipality; provided, however, that construction or maintenance projects of the department of transportation or state road tollway authority which disturb one or more contiguous acres of land shall be subject to provisions of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7.1; except where the department of transportation, the Georgia Highway Authority, or the state road and tollway authority is a secondary permittee for a project located within a larger common plan of development or sale under the state general permit, in which case a copy of a notice of intent under the state general permit shall be submitted to the local issuing authority, the local issuing authority shall enforce compliance with the minimum requirements set forth in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 as if a permit had been issued, and violations shall be subject to the same penalties as violations by permit holders. 
                  (10)  Any land-disturbing activities conducted by any electric membership corporation or municipal electrical system or any public utility under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Public Service Commission.

                  DIVISION 3. - MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR EROSION, SEDIMENTATION, AND POLLUTION CONTROL USING BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES 

                  Sec. 26-421. - General provisions. 
                  Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the ordinance and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of sections 26-432 and 26-433 of this article. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit. 
                  (Ord. No. 2018-02, § 1, 2-26-2018) 
                  Sec. 26-422. - Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
                  Minimum requirements and best management practices: 
                  (1)  Best management practices as set forth in sections 26-432 and 26-433 of this article shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with subsection (2) of this section or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to subsection O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
                  (2)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land-disturbing activities occur. 
                  (5)  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsections 26-423(15), (16) and (17), in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c).

                  Sec. 26-423. - Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia adopted. 
                  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  (7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in runoff water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in this article; 
                  (15)  Except as provided in paragraph (16) of this section, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the groundwater table year-round; for which groundwater is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines.

                  Sec. 26-432. - Application requirements. 
                  Application requirements are as follows: 
                  (1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the City of Snellville without first obtaining a permit from the City of Snellville to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
                  (2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the department of planning and development and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in section 26-433 of this article. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of sections 26-422 and 26-423 of this article will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by three copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
                  (3)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a), half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  (4)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by subsections 26-423(15) and (16) have been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per subsection 26-432(6), have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
                  (5)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this article section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
                  (6)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations.

                  Sec. 26-441. - Inspection and enforcement. 
                  (a)  The city inspector will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article.

                  (d)  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
                  (e)  The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). The district or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
                  (f)  The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within 90 days after notification by the division, the division shall revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority.

                  Variances from the above buffer and setback requirements may be granted in accordance with the following provisions: 
                  (1)  The project involves the construction of one single-family home for residential use by the owner of the subject property on a parcel that was platted prior to the effective date of this article, and its shape, topography or other existing physical condition prevents land development consistent with this article, and the department finds and determines that the requirements of this article prohibit the otherwise lawful use of the property by the owner, the board of appeals may grant a variance from the buffer and setback requirements hereunder, provided such variance requires mitigation measures to offset the effects of any proposed land development on the parcel. 
                  (2)  Except as provided above, the board of appeals shall grant no variance from any provision of this article without first conducting a public hearing on the application for variance and authorizing the granting of the variance by an affirmative vote of the board of appeals. The city shall give public notice of each such public hearing in a newspaper of general circulation within the city. The city shall require that the applicant post a sign giving notice of the proposed variance and the public hearing. The sign shall be of a size and posted in such a location on the property as to be clearly visible from the primary adjacent road right-of-way. 
                  Variances will be considered only in the following cases: 
                  a.  When a property's shape, topography or other physical conditions existing at the time of the adoption of this article prevents land development unless a buffer variance is granted. 
                  b.  Unusual circumstances when strict adherence to the minimal buffer requirements in the ordinance would create an extreme hardship. 
                  Variances will not be considered when, following adoption of this article, actions of any property owner of a given property have created conditions of a hardship on that property. 
                  (3)  At a minimum, a variance request shall include the following information: 
                  a.  A site map that includes locations of all streams, wetlands, floodplain boundaries and other natural features, as determined by field survey; 
                  b.  A description of the shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property; 
                  c.  A detailed site plan that shows the locations of all existing and proposed structures and other impervious cover, the limits of all existing and proposed land disturbance, both inside and outside the buffer and setback. The exact area of the buffer to be affected shall be accurately and clearly indicated; 
                  d.  Documentation of unusual hardship should the buffer be maintained; 
                  e.  At least one alternative plan, which does not include a buffer or setback intrusion, or an explanation of why such a site plan is not possible; 
                  f.  A calculation of the total area and length of the proposed intrusion; 
                  g.  A stormwater management site plan, if applicable; and, 
                  h.  Proposed mitigation, if any, for the intrusion. If no mitigation is proposed, the request must include an explanation of why none is being proposed. 
                  (4)  The following factors will be considered in determining whether to issue a variance: 
                  a.  The shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property; 
                  b.  The locations of all streams on the property, including along property boundaries; 
                  c.  The location and extent of the proposed buffer or setback intrusion; and, 
                  d.  Whether alternative designs are possible which require less intrusion or no intrusion; 
                  e.  The long-term and construction water-quality impacts of the proposed variance; 
                  f.  Whether issuance of the variance is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment.

                  (1)  The flood hazard areas of the City of Snellville are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare; 
                  (2)  Flood hazard areas can serve important stormwater management, water quality, streambank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation and ecological purposes when permanently protected as undisturbed or minimally disturbed areas; 
                  (3)  Effective floodplain management and flood hazard protection activities can: (1) protect human life and health; (2) minimize damage to private property; (3) minimize damage to public facilities and infrastructure such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; and (4) minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; and 
                  (4)  Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a) have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the City of Snellville, Georgia, does ordain this article and establishes this set of floodplain management and flood hazard reduction policies for the purpose of regulating the use of flood hazard areas. It is determined that the regulation of flood hazard areas and the prevention of flood damage are in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety, as well as to private and public property.

                  (1)  Restricting or prohibiting uses activities which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to flooding or erosion hazards or in flood heights or velocities; 
                  (2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction or renovation; 
                  (3)  Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; 
                  (4)  Controlling filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage; 
                  (5)  Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and 
                  (6)  Protect the stormwater management, water quality, streambank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation and ecological functions of natural floodplain areas.

An application for a development permit which proposes any encroachment into or alteration of a floodway shall require submittal to the department complete plans and engineering calculations as required by this article for "no rise" certification. The department shall review and authorize such encroachments prior to the issuance of a development permit and shall obtain from the applicant an engineering "no-rise" certification signed by a professional engineer stating that the proposed development will not create any change to the pre-project base flood elevations, floodway elevations, or floodway widths. If the applicant proposes to revise the floodway boundaries or base flood elevations, no permit authorizing an encroachment into or the alteration of the floodway shall be issued by the department until an affirmative conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) or conditional letter of map amendment (CLOMA), whichever is applicable, is issued and "no rise" certification is approved by the department. An application for a map revision shall be submitted first to the department. As-built plans and calculations shall be required to be provided to the department by the applicant at the time of completion of the encroachment. Payment of any review fees associated with the review and approval of the encroachment shall be the responsibility of the applicant. Final plats or certificates of occupancy shall not be issued by the department until an affirmative letter of map revision (LOMR) or letter of map amendment (LOMA), whichever is applicable, is issued.

                  (2)  Encroachments for bridges, culverts, roadways and utilities within the regulatory floodway may be permitted provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase to the pre-project base flood elevations, floodway elevations, or floodway widths during the base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
                  (3)  In areas where the floodplain has been established but the base flood elevation (BFE) and/or the floodway has not been established on FIS maps, no encroachments into areas of special flood hazard, including fill or structures, shall be authorized unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided to the department demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the floodplain more than 0.01 foot at any point. The study shall be submitted as a revision/amendment to the FIS maps showing the BFE and the floodway. Approval of the revision/amendment must be received before the final plat can be approved or a certificate of occupancy can be issued. 
                  (4)  In areas beyond the limits of study on the flood boundary and floodways maps or FIRM, which contains a watercourse, and have greater than 100 acres of surface drainage area above the property, no increase in flood elevations off-site shall be authorized.

                  (a)  No construction or structures, including grading, filling, cutting or displacement of earth shall be allowed within the base flood or future conditions floodplain that could result in any of the following: 
                  (1)  Raise the base flood or future conditions flood elevation equal to or more than 0.01 foot. 
                  (2)  Reduce the base flood or future conditions flood storage capacity. All compensation shall occur either within the boundaries of ownership of the property being developed, or within a permanent, recorded flood control easement (which shall be a part of the departmental record), and shall be within a reasonable proximity to the location of the encroachment. Acceptable means of providing required compensation include: lowering of natural ground elevations within the floodplain; or lowering of adjoining land areas to create additional floodplain; or raising of the future conditions flood elevation within the boundaries of ownership of the property being developed. All cut areas are to be graded to a slope of no less than two percent. In no case shall any required compensation be provided via bottom storage or by excavating below the elevation of the top of the natural (pre-development) stream channel unless such excavation results from widening or relocation of the stream channel. A step-backwater analysis will be required to verify no rise conditions, flood storage volumes and flow characteristics. 
                  (3)  Change the flow characteristics of the waters of the base flood or future conditions flood as they pass both the upstream and the downstream boundaries of the property. Verification shall be provided via a step-backwater analysis. 
                  (4)  Create hazardous or erosion-producing velocities, or result in excessive sedimentation. 
                  (b)  All proposed development shall have public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage. 
                  (c)  Any significant changes or revisions to the flood data adopted herein and shown on the the City of Snellville FIRM shall be submitted as a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) or conditional letter of map amendment (CLOMA), whichever is applicable. The CLOMR submittal shall be subject to approval by the department using the community consent forms before forwarding the submittal package to FEMA for final approval. The responsibility for forwarding the CLOMR to FEMA and for obtaining the CLOMR approval shall be the responsibility of the applicant. Within six months of the completion of construction, the applicant shall submit as-built surveys for a final letter of map revision (LOMR). A letter of map revision (LOMR) or letter of map amendment (LOMA) must be issued before the final plat can be approved or a certificate of occupancy can be issued. Significant changes or revisions shall be defined as any change to the City of Snellville FIRM easily observed when plotted at a scale of one inch = 500 feet. The changes or revisions may be due to, but are not limited to more current and/or superior topographic information or compensatory cut and fill grading done as a part of the development.

Cross-sections (which may be supplemented by the applicant) and flow information from the existing FIS will be obtained whenever available. Where applicable, computations will be shown duplicating FIS results and then computations will be rerun with the proposed modifications to determine the new base flood and future conditions flood profiles. 
                  (3)  Floodplain storage calculations based on cross-sections (at least one every 100 feet) showing existing and proposed floodplain conditions must be provided to show that future conditions floodplain storage capacity will not be diminished by the development. 
                  (4)  If changes to the base flood or future conditions flood elevation are proposed, profiles of the channel showing the existing and proposed base flood and future conditions flood elevations must be provided. 
                  (5)  The study shall include a preliminary plat, grading plan, or site plan, as appropriate, which shall clearly define all future conditions floodplain encroachments. 
                  (6)  The floodway shall be determined when any encroachment in the floodplain is proposed or a detailed study is performed to determine flood profiles. 
                  (7)  Detailed flood studies in areas where the floodplain has been established but the base flood elevation (BFE) and/or the floodway has not been established and in areas beyond the limits of study on the FIRM, which may contain a watercourse, and have greater than 100 acres of surface drainage area above the property, shall be submitted showing the base flood elevations, future conditions flood elevations, and the floodway. Approval of the study must be received before the final plat of the affected lots can be approved or a certificate of occupancy can be issued.

Unless flight by such person or other circumstances make it impractical, a law enforcement officer shall, prior to any arrest for an offense under this section, afford the person an opportunity to dispel any alarm or immediate concern which would otherwise be warranted by requesting the person to identify himself and explain his presence and conduct.

                  Sec. 38-140. - Findings and intent. 
                  (a)  Repeat sexual offenders, sexual offenders who use physical violence, and sexual offenders who prey on children are sexual predators who present an extreme threat to the public safety. Sexual offenders are extremely likely to use physical violence and to repeat their offenses, and most sexual offenders commit many offenses, have many more victims than are ever reported, and are prosecuted for only a fraction of their crimes. This makes the cost of sexual offender victimization to society at large, while incalculable, clearly exorbitant. 
                  (b)  It is the intent of this article to serve the city's compelling interest to promote, protect and improve the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city by creating areas around locations where children regularly congregate in concentrated numbers wherein certain sexual offenders and sexual predators are prohibited from establishing temporary or permanent residence.

                  (b)  Measurement of distance.

                  (c)  Penalties.

                  (d)  Exceptions. A person residing within 2,500 feet of any school, designated public school bus stop, day care center, park, playground, or other place where children regularly congregate does not commit a violation of this section if any of the following apply: 
                  (1)  The person established the permanent residence or temporary residence and reported and registered the residence pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 42-1-12 and had an ownership or leasehold interest in the property, all prior to May 1, 2006.

                  Sec. 38-152. - Legislative intent. 
                  (a)  The mayor and city council finds and declares that it is the right of every person to be secure and protected from fear, intimidation, and physical harm caused by the activities of violent groups and individuals. It is not the intent of this article to interfere with the exercise of the constitutionally protected rights of freedom of expression and association. The mayor and city council recognizes the constitutional right of every citizen to harbor and express beliefs on any lawful subject whatsoever, to associate lawfully with others who share similar beliefs, to petition lawfully constituted authority for a redress of perceived grievances, and to participate in the electoral process. 
                  (b)  The mayor and city council, however, further finds that the city is in a state of crisis which has been caused by violent street gangs whose members threaten, terrorize, and commit a multitude of crimes against the peaceful citizens of their neighborhoods. These activities, both individually and collectively, present a clear and present danger to public order and safety and are not constitutionally protected. 
                  (c)  The mayor and city council finds that there are criminal street gangs operating in the city and that the number of gang related crimes is increasing. It is the intent of the mayor and city council in enacting this article to seek the eradication of criminal activity by street gangs by focusing upon patterns of criminal gang activity and upon the organized nature of street gangs which together are the chief source of terror created by street gangs. 
                  (d)  The mayor and city council further finds that an effective means of punishing and deterring the criminal activities of street gangs is through forfeiture of the profits, proceeds, and instrumentalities acquired, accumulated, or used by street gangs.

Failure to submit such books or records within 30 days after demand is made therefore shall be grounds for revocation of the regulatory fee certificate and the right to do business in the city. Adequate records shall be kept in the city or made available in the city for examination by the designated city agents. If, after examination of the books or records, it is determined that a deficiency exists as a result of improper designation of a dominant line of a business, profession or occupation, a penalty of ten percent of the deficiency and an additional interest of one percent per month of the amount of the deficiency shall be assessed.

                  Failure of any person to pay an applicable administrative fee, regulatory fee or occupation tax, or any part thereof, before it becomes delinquent, or failure to permit inspection of books as required in section 54-176 shall result in any business tax certificate or regulatory fee certificate granted by the city under this article permitting such person to do business in the city for the current year being automatically revoked without any further action required by the city. No new occupation tax certificate or regulatory fee certificate shall be granted by the city for the operation of a business for which any part of the occupation tax or fees required by this article are unpaid, nor shall such certificates be issued to a person who has failed to submit adequate records for inspection as required in section 54-176.

The defendants at execution shall have the rights of defense by affidavit of illegality of the tax or otherwise as provided by the City Charter and state law in regard to tax executions.

If at any time after the entry of the nulla bona has been made, the person against whom the execution is made pays the tax in full, together with all interest, penalties and costs accrued on the tax, such person may collect any fees and charges for services and goods due such person as though such person had never defaulted in the payment of the taxes.

Operators collecting the tax shall be allowed a percentage of the tax due and accounted for and shall be reimbursed in the form of a deduction in submitting, reporting and paying the amount due, if the amount is not delinquent at the time of payment. The rate of the deductions from state tax shall be the same rate authorized for deduction from state tax under the Georgia Retailers' and Consumers' Sales and Use Tax Act, approved February 20, 1951 (1951 Ga. Laws, page 360), as now or hereafter amended. 
                  (f)  Extension of time for filing a return and paying tax. For a good cause, the city clerk, may extend no more than one month, the time for making any return or payment of the tax. No further extension of time may be granted.

The police dispatcher shall make calls for wrecker service on a rotating basis from the appropriate call list when a specific service is requested. Each list requires specific equipment as is listed below.

A standard duty wrecker is a wrecker which has at least a 10,000-pound minimum gross vehicle weight (GVW) rating, equipped with an 8,000-pound P.T.O. mechanically-driven power winch, crane and boom having dual wheels or of equal capabilities.

                  (b)  For documentation purposes, the police dispatcher shall maintain tour logs which include a standard duty log, a heavy duty log, an owner request log and an emergency call log. Each log shall include wrecker call time, date, location, police officer making the request and police dispatcher on duty. In addition, the owner request log shall indicate the name and address of the party making the specific request. 
                  (c)  A wrecker service on either rotating call list that has been called by the department and canceled will receive the next rotating call. 
                  (d)  In case of emergency (i.e., trapped person or major intersection blocked), the nearest qualified wrecker will be called along with the Gwinnett County Fire Rescue. Emergency status shall be determined by the Gwinnett County Fire Rescue or Watch Commander on the scene.

Response time shall be measured from the time the wrecker service operator accepts the call for service from the police dispatcher. 
                  a.  In any 12-month period, if a wrecker service is found to be in noncompliance with the response time standards of this division, the wrecker service shall be notified by the Snellville Police Department and provided with written notice of such noncompliance and removed from the appropriate call lists according to the following schedule: 
                  1.  First offense: Two rotations off list; 
                  2.  Second offense: Five rotations off list; 
                  3.  Third offense: Ten rotations off list; 
                  4.  Fourth offense: Removal from both lists. 
                  (g)  When a wrecker service is unavailable for calls for an extended period, the wrecker service operator shall inform the chief of police or designee of the period of time during which said service is unavailable and the following procedure applies:

                  DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

                  Sec. 62-31. - Title. 
                  This article shall be known as the "Illicit Discharge and Illegal Connection Ordinance." 
                  (Ord. of 6-28-2004(4)) 
                  Sec. 62-32. - Authority. 
                  The authority for this article is based on home rule provisions of the Georgia Constitution, Article IX, Section 2, Paragraph 3(a)(6). 
                  (Ord. of 6-28-2004(4)) 
                  Sec. 62-33. - Findings. 
                  It is hereby determined that: 
                  (1)  The municipal separate storm sewer system was designed and installed to manage stormwater so as to prevent localized flooding, damage to property and risk to public safety; 
                  (2)  The municipal separate storm sewer system was not designed or installed as a receiving system for non-stormwater discharges; 
                  (3)  Discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system that are not composed entirely of stormwater contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters; 
                  (4)  These non-stormwater discharges occur due to spills, dumping and improper connections to the municipal separate storm sewer system from residential, industrial, commercial or institutional establishments; 
                  (5)  These non-stormwater discharges not only impact local waterways individually, but geographically dispersed, small volume non-stormwater discharges can have cumulative impacts on receiving waters; 
                  (6)  The impacts of these non-stormwater discharges adversely affect public health and safety, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters; 
                  (7)  These impacts can be minimized through the regulation of spills, dumping and discharges into the municipal separate storm sewer system; 
                  (8)  Localities in the State of Georgia are required to comply with a number of state and federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of nonpoint source pollution caused by non-stormwater discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system; 
                  (9)  The Clean Water Act requires the management and maintenance of the municipal separate storm sewer system and the management of discharges to that system; 
                  (10)  Therefore, in order to prohibit such non-stormwater discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system, it is determined that the regulation of spills, improper dumping and discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety, and the environment. 
                  (Ord. of 6-28-2004(4)) 
                  Sec. 62-34. - Purpose and intent. 
                  The purpose of this article is to protect the public health, safety, environment and general welfare through the regulation of non-stormwater discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system to the maximum extent practicable as required by federal law. This article establishes methods for controlling the introduction of non-stormwater discharges into the municipal separate storm sewer system in order to comply with requirements of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit process. The objectives of this article are to: 
                  (1)  Comply with all Georgia Department of Natural Resources (DNR) and Federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) stormwater regulations developed pursuant to the Clean Water Act; and 
                  (2)  Prohibit illicit discharges and illegal connections to the municipal separate storm sewer system; and 
                  (3)  Prevent non-stormwater discharges, generated as a result of spills, inappropriate dumping or disposal, to the municipal separate storm sewer system; and 
                  (4)  To establish legal authority to carry out all inspection, surveillance, monitoring and enforcement procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this article.

                  Sec. 62-82. - Findings. 
                  The City of Snellville Mayor and City Council make the following findings of fact: 
                  (1)  Snellville is authorized by the Georgia Constitution of 1983, including, without limitation, Article IX, Section II, Paragraph III thereof and O.C.G.A. § 36-82-62 to provide stormwater management services throughout Snellville. 
                  (2)  In order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public, the government of Snellville hereby exercises its authority to establish a stormwater utility enterprise fund and establish rates for stormwater management services. 
                  (3)  In promulgating the regulations contained in this section, Snellville is acting pursuant to authority granted by the Constitution of the State of Georgia and the City Charter of Snellville to provide for stormwater collection and disposal. 
                  (4)  Improper management of stormwater runoff may cause erosion of lands, threaten businesses and residences, and other facilities with water damage and may environmentally impair the rivers, streams and other bodies of water within Snellville. 
                  (5)  A system for the collection, conveyance, storage, treatment and disposal of stormwater provides services to all properties within Snellville and surrounding areas. 
                  (6)  Snellville presently owns and operates stormwater management systems and facilities, which have been developed over many years. The future usefulness and operational function of the existing stormwater management systems and facilities owned and operated by the city, and the additions and improvements thereto, rests on the ability of the city to effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use, and enhance stormwater systems and facilities within the city in concert with the management of other water resources within the city. In order to do so, the city must have both a comprehensive stormwater management program as well as an adequate and stable funding source for its comprehensive program operation and drainage-related capital improvement needs. 
                  (7)  Failure to effectively manage stormwater can adversely affect the operations of the sanitary sewer system operated by the county thereby increasing the likelihood of infiltration and inflow into the sanitary sewer system. 
                  (8)  Failure to effectively manage stormwater contributes to the potential degradation of the surface water quality in area water bodies. 
                  (9)  The city is required under federal and state regulations [i.e. National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Phase I Stormwater Permit under which the City operates] to provide enhanced management of stormwater runoff quality to mitigate the impacts of pollutants which may be discharged from the public municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) and stormwater conveyance system into State of Georgia or United States' waters. Therefore, it is appropriate for the city to impose a stormwater user fee charge upon all improved properties that may discharge, directly or indirectly, into the public MS4 and stormwater conveyance system, whether the property is private or public in nature. 
                  (10)  Compliance with the regulatory obligations of the NPDES Phase I Stormwater Permit, Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District and along with other city stormwater program activities will affect the cost of providing stormwater management services above what is currently being spent for water quality management, drainage system maintenance, flood control and other program activities. 
                  (11)  The cost of operating and maintaining the Snellville stormwater management system and financing necessary repairs, replacements, improvements and extensions thereof should, to the extent practicable, be allocated in relationship to the services received from the system. 
                  (12)  The professional engineering, and financing analysis and related documents prepared by the city's consulting stormwater engineer properly assesses and defines the city's stormwater management program problems, needs, goals, priorities as well as the stormwater management program funding strategy. 
                  (13)  Given the stormwater management program problems, needs, goals, priorities and funding strategy identified in the aforementioned professional engineering and financing analysis, it is appropriate to authorize the formation of an organizational and accounting entity dedicated specifically to the management, maintenance, protection, control, regulation, use, and enhancement of stormwater management systems within the city in concert with other water resource management programs. 
                  (14)  Stormwater management is applicable and needed throughout the incorporated areas of the city. While specific service and facility demands may differ from area to area at any given point in time, a stormwater management service area encompassing all lands and water bodies within the incorporated areas of the city is consistent with the present and future needs of the community. 
                  (15)  The stormwater needs in the city include, but are not limited to, protection of the public health, safety, and welfare of the community. Provision of stormwater management services renders and/or results in both a service and a benefit to all properties, property owners, citizens, and residents of the city in a variety of ways. 
                  (16)  The stormwater management services rendered may differ depending on many factors and considerations, including but not limited to location, demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater management systems and programs, and risk exposure. It is practical and equitable to allocate the cost of stormwater management among the owners of improved properties in proportion to the long term demands the properties impose on the city's stormwater management services which result in services to such properties and the owners thereof. 
                  (17)  A stormwater management program (SWMP) provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering stormwater management services throughout the city, and the most equitable means to regulate the use of a higher level of stormwater management services within the city through stormwater user fee charges, user fees and other mechanisms. 
                  (18)  A schedule of stormwater utility user fee charges based in part on the area of impervious surface located on each improved property is the most appropriate and equitable means of allocating the cost of stormwater management services throughout the city. Such user fee charges may be complemented by other types of charges which address specific needs, including, but not limited to, special service fees, special assessments, revenue bonds, use of proceeds from special purpose local option sales taxes and other forms of revenue, as deemed appropriate by the mayor and city council. 
                  (19)  The existence of privately owned and maintained on-site or off-site systems, facilities, activities or assets which reduce or otherwise mitigate the impact of a particular property on the city's SWMP, and the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and/or stormwater management systems and facilities, should be taken into account to reduce the user fee charge on that property either in the form of a direct reduction or credit, and such reduction or credit should be conditional upon continuing provision of such services, systems, facilities, activities or assets in a manner complying with the standards and codes as determined by the stormwater utility manager. Reductions or credits for privately owned and maintained stormwater management systems, facilities, activities or assets shall be generally proportional to the affect that such systems have on the peak rate of runoff from the property. 
                  (20)  The area of impervious surfaces on each improved property is the most important factor influencing the cost of the stormwater management services provided by the city or to be provided by the city in the future, and the area of impervious surfaces on each property is therefore the most appropriate parameter for calculating a periodic stormwater user fee charge. 
                  (21)  It is imperative that the proceeds from all user fee charges for stormwater management services, together with any other revenues raised or otherwise allocated specifically to stormwater management services, be dedicated solely to those purposes, and such proceeds of user fee charges and revenues shall therefore be deposited into the enterprise accounting fund of the city stormwater utility and shall remain in that fund and be dispersed only for stormwater management capital, operating and non-operating costs, lease payments and debt service of bonds or other indebtedness for stormwater management purposes.

                  Sec. 62-83. - Definitions. 
                  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Act means and refers to the Clean Water Act as amended by the Water Quality Act of 1987 (33 U.S.C. § 1251 et seq.), as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency pursuant thereto. 
                  Credit means a reduction in the amount of a stormwater user fee charge to the owner of a particular property for the existence and use of privately owned, maintained and operated on-site or off-site stormwater systems or facilities, or continuing provision of services or activities that reduce or mitigate the city's cost of providing stormwater management services for that particular property. 
                  Customers of the stormwater utility shall include all persons, properties, and entities serviced by and/or benefiting from the services provided by the city's SWMP and the stormwater utility. These services include, but are not necessarily limited to, the stormwater utility's administration, management, maintenance, expansion, and improvement of the public stormwater management systems for the handling of stormwater runoff from private and public properties, and the regulation of the public and private stormwater management systems, controls, facilities, and activities. 
                  Improved property means property altered from its natural state by construction or installation of more than 500 square feet of impervious surfaces. 
                  Hydrologic response defines the manner and means whereby stormwater collects, remains, infiltrates, and is conveyed from a property. Hydrologic response is dependent on several factors including, but not limited to, the presence of impervious surface, the parcel's size, the parcel's shape, the parcel's vegetative canopy, the parcel's groundwater, the parcel's antecedent moisture and the parcel's geologic condition. 
                  Impervious surface means those areas which prevent or impede the infiltration of stormwater into the soil in the manner in which it entered the soil, in natural conditions, prior to development. Common impervious surfaces include, but are not limited to, rooftops, buildings or structures, sidewalks, walkways, patio areas, driveways, parking lots, storage areas, awnings and other fabric or plastic coverings, and other surfaces which prevent or impede the natural infiltration of stormwater runoff which existed prior to development. 
                  Public water influence zone means those areas lying downstream of a culvert, or other stormwater management conveyance system. On the downstream side of the conveyance system, the public water influence zone will extend for a length of six times the diameter (or width) of the culvert from which runoff is being discharged (Field Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia, Third Edition, pg. 99), and within the horizontal limits set forth in the aforementioned field manual. For example, if a 48-inch diameter culvert is discharging to a private property, the public water influence zone shall extend 24 feet (six times 48-inches) from the end of the culvert and for the specified width (i.e. typically the width of the creek). The Snellville Stormwater Utility may perform maintenance and/or capital construction activities only within that portion of the public water influence zone which the city has an ownership interest in, or for which a dedicated easement has been granted to, and accepted by the city for such purpose. 
                  Service area means the entire land area within the corporate limits of the city. 
                  Stormwater management services mean all services provided by the city which relate to: 
                  (1)  Transfer, control, conveyance or movement of stormwater runoff through the incorporated portions of the city; 
                  (2)  Maintenance, repair and replacement of existing stormwater management systems and facilities; 
                  (3)  Planning, development, design and construction of additional stormwater management systems and facilities to meet current and anticipated needs; 
                  (4)  Regulation of the use of stormwater management services, systems and facilities; and 
                  (5)  Compliance with applicable state and federal stormwater management regulations and permit requirements. 
                  (6)  Education of the public as to stormwater issues. 
                  (7)  Inspection and monitoring of water quantity or quality to require compliance with state or local standards and stormwater management programs. 
                  (8)  Such other services as the stormwater utility manager may deem appropriate. 
                  Stormwater management services may address the quality of stormwater runoff as well as the quantity thereof. 
                  Stormwater management systems and facilities mean those natural and manmade channels, swales, ditches, rivers, streams, creeks, branches, reservoirs, ponds, drainage ways, inlets, catch basins, pipes, headwalls, storm sewers, lakes and other physical works, properties and improvements which transfer, control, convey, detain, retain, treat or otherwise influence the movement of stormwater runoff. 
                  Stormwater user fee charge means the periodic user fee charge imposed pursuant to this article by the Snellville Stormwater Utility for providing stormwater management services. This term shall exclude special charges to the owners of particular properties for services, systems or facilities related to stormwater management, including, but not limited to, charges for development plan review, inspection of development projects, on-site stormwater control systems and other stormwater management services provided by Snellville for which a corresponding fee is collected for the service rendered. 
                  Stormwater utility manager means the person appointed or hired by the city manager or the entity selected by the mayor and city council to administer the provisions of this article. 
                  Undeveloped land means land in its unaltered natural condition or which is modified to such a minimal degree as to have a hydrologic response comparable to land in an unaltered natural condition shall be deemed undeveloped. Undeveloped land shall have minimal impervious surface, which impedes the infiltration of stormwater runoff or causes stormwater runoff to collect, concentrate or flow in a manner materially different from what would occur if the land were in an unaltered natural condition. For purposes of this article, undeveloped land includes property altered from its natural condition by the creation or installation of 500 square feet or less of impervious surface. 
                  User is defined as any person who uses property, which maintains connection to, discharges to, or otherwise receives services from the city for stormwater management.

                  Sec. 62-84. - Stormwater utility and enterprise fund established. 
                  (a)  There is hereby established a stormwater utility to be known as the Snellville Stormwater Utility, which shall be responsible for stormwater management services throughout the incorporated areas of the city, and which shall provide for the management, protection, control, regulation, use and enhancement of the city's stormwater management services. 
                  (b)  There is hereby established a stormwater utility enterprise fund in the city budgeting and accounting systems for the purpose of dedicating and protecting all funding applicable to the purposes and responsibilities of the Snellville SWMP and Stormwater Utility, including, but not limited to, rates, charges, and fees as may be established by the city council from time to time, and other funds that may be transferred or allocated to the Snellville Stormwater Utility. All revenues and receipts of the stormwater utility shall be placed in the stormwater utility enterprise fund and shall be used solely for stormwater management services. All expenses and capital investments of the stormwater utility shall be paid from the stormwater utility enterprise fund; provided, however, that other revenues, receipts and resources not accounted for in the stormwater utility enterprise fund may be applied to stormwater management services as deemed appropriate by the city. 
                  (c)  The city shall place responsibility with the stormwater utility manager for operation, maintenance and regulation of the SWMP and stormwater management services performed, owned and operated or maintained by Snellville, and other related assets, including, but not limited to, properties, other than road rights-of-way, upon which such stormwater management systems and facilities are located, easements, rights-of-entry and access and certain equipment used solely for stormwater management. The stormwater utility manager shall have discretion in carrying out the duties and responsibilities under this article.

                  Sec. 62-85. - Scope of responsibility for stormwater management systems and facilities. 
                  (a)  The city owns or has rights established by written agreements which allow it to operate, maintain, improve and access those stormwater management systems and facilities which are located: 
                  (1)  Within public road rights-of-way; 
                  (2)  On private property but within easements granted to, and accepted by the city, or are otherwise permitted to be located on such private property by written agreements for rights-of-entry, rights-of-access, rights-of-use or other permanent provisions for operation, maintenance, improvement and access to the stormwater management system facilities located thereon; 
                  (3)  On private property but within a public water influence zone; 
                  (4)  On land dedicated to, and accepted by, the city solely for the operation, maintenance, improvement and access to the stormwater management systems and facilities located thereon; or 
                  (5)  On public land which is owned by the city and/or land of another governmental entity upon which the city has agreements providing for the operation, maintenance, improvement and access to the stormwater management systems and facilities located thereon. 
                  (b)  Operation, maintenance and/or improvement of stormwater management systems and facilities which are located on private or public property not owned by the city, and for which there has been no written agreement granting easements, rights-of-entry, rights-of-access, rights-of-use or other form of dedication thereof to the city for operation, maintenance, improvement and access of such stormwater management and systems and facilities shall be and remain the legal responsibility of the property owner, except as otherwise provided for by the state and federal laws and regulations. 
                  (c)  It is the express intent of this article to protect the public health, safety and welfare of people and property in general, but not to create any special duty or relationship with any individual person, or to any specific property within or outside the boundaries of the city. The city expressly reserves the right to assert all available immunities and defenses in any action seeking to impose monetary damages or equitable remedies upon the city, its elected officials, officers, employees and agents arising out of any alleged failure or breach of duty or relationship. 
                  (d)  If any permit, plan approval, inspection or similar act is required by the city as a condition precedent to any activity or change upon property not owned by the city pursuant to this or any other regulatory ordinance, regulation or rule of the city, or under federal or state law, the issuance of such permit, plan approval or inspection shall not be deemed to constitute a warranty, express or implied, nor shall it afford the basis for any action, including any action based on failure to permit, negligent issuance of a permit, negligent plan approval, or negligent maintenance of any permitted stormwater management system or facility not expressly dedicated to and accepted by the city for further maintenance in an action seeking the imposition of money damages or equitable remedies against the city, its commissioners, officers, employees or agents.

                  Sec. 62-86. - Stormwater user fee charges. 
                  (a)  It shall be the policy of the city that user fee charges for stormwater management services to be provided by the stormwater utility in the designated service areas shall be equitably derived through methods which have a demonstrable relationship to the varied demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater management services by individual properties and/or the level of service rendered by, or resulting from, the provision of stormwater management services. Stormwater user fee charge rates shall be structured so as to be uniform within the customer class, and the resultant user fee charges shall bear a substantial relationship to the cost of providing stormwater management services. User fee charge rates shall be in addition to other rates, charges, or fees employed for stormwater management within the incorporated areas of the city, including, but not limited to, plan review and inspection fees, fees for special services, fees in lieu of regulatory requirements, system development charges and special assessments. 
                  (b)  To the extent practicable, credits against stormwater user fee charges shall be provided for on-site stormwater control systems and activities constructed, operated, maintained and performed to the city's standards by public and private property owners which eliminate, mitigate or compensate for the impact that the property or person may have upon stormwater runoff discharged to public stormwater management systems and facilities or to private stormwater management systems and facilities which impact the proper function of public stormwater management systems and facilities.

                  Sec. 62-87. - Stormwater user fee charges authorized. 
                  (a)  The stormwater utility manager is authorized to impose a service charge on each user of the stormwater system pursuant to the terms of this section. The stormwater user fee charge and rate structure may be amended from time to time by official action of the mayor and council. The stormwater utility manager shall review the stormwater user fee charge and rate structure on an annual basis and any rate changes will be approved by the mayor and council. 
                  (b)  For purposes of this article, an ERU shall be equivalent to 3,800 square feet of impervious property. ERU or "Equivalent Runoff Unit" shall mean the average impervious area of a single-family detached residential dwelling unit located within the city as periodically determined and established as provided in this article. ERU rate shall mean the dollar value periodically determined and assigned to each ERU as a charge for stormwater services, and expressed as a dollar value per ERU per month. 
                  (c)  The stormwater user fees provided in this article shall be applied and computed for each user during the customary billing periods. 
                  (d)  Subject to the exemptions provided for in section 62-92 and the credits provided for in section 62-93, the ERU rate to be applied to all properties shall be $3.10/ERU /month. 
                  (e)  Any changes to the stormwater user fee shall be accomplished by adoption of a resolution of the mayor and council. 
                  (f)  No revenues generated by the stormwater enterprise user fee shall be used for any purpose other than stormwater expenses. 
                  (g)  The stormwater fee for single-family residential property shall be the following percentage of the ERU rate: 

                   
                  (h)  Commercial properties shall be billed one ERU for each 3,800 square feet, or portion thereof, of impervious surfaces located on the property to establish the total number of ERUs for billing. Fractional ERUs for commercial properties will be rounded to two decimal places to establish the actual number of ERUs for billing. If a commercial property has less than 1.00 ERU, then the user will be billed a minimum of 1.00 ERU.

                  (a)  All property owners of improved property within the incorporated areas of Snellville shall provide, manage, maintain, and operate on-site stormwater management systems sufficient to collect, convey, detain, and discharge stormwater runoff in a safe manner consistent with all applicable city development regulations, ordinances, and state and federal laws. 
                  (b)  The stormwater utility manager or their designee, is authorized to enter and inspect properties and facilities at reasonable times upon reasonable notice to the property owner as often as may be necessary to determine compliance with this article. For the purposes of this section, reasonable notice shall mean at least 24 hours' written notice, which notice may be posted in a prominent location on the property, and a phone call to the property owner on the day of the proposed inspection. 
                  (1)  The stormwater utility manager or their designee shall first attempt to obtain the permission of the property owner prior to entering on to any private property. In the event permission is expressly denied, the stormwater utility manager or their designee shall proceed under the provisions of subsection (b)(8) below. 
                  (2)  If a property or facility has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry onto or into its premises, as the case may be, the owner or operator shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access to representatives of the City of Snellville. 
                  (3)  The owner or operator shall allow the stormwater utility manager, or their designee, ready access to those certain parts of the premises necessary for the purposes of inspection, sampling, photography, videotaping, examination and copying of any records that are required under the conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater. 
                  (4)  The stormwater utility manager, or their designee, shall have the right to set up on any property or facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the stormwater utility manager, or their designee, to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of flow discharges. 
                  (5)  The stormwater utility manager or their designee may require the owner or operator to install monitoring equipment and perform monitoring as necessary, and make the monitoring data available to the city. This sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition. All devices used to measure flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy. 
                  (6)  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to reasonable access to the property or facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the owner or operator at the written request of the public works director, or their designee and shall not be replaced until such time as the inspection and/or sampling, along with any necessary follow-up inspection and/or sampling is complete. 
                  (7)  There shall be no unreasonable delays in allowing the stormwater utility manager, or their designee access to a facility. 
                  (8)  If the stormwater utility manager, or their designee has been refused access to any part of the premises from which stormwater is discharged, and the stormwater utility manager, or their designee is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this article, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this article or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, environment and welfare of the community, then upon obtaining the written approval of the city manager the stormwater utility manager, or their designee may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction. 
                  (c)  When the stormwater utility manager determines that a violation exists, the stormwater utility manager shall send a notice of violation by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the owner or owners of the property described, as their name and address are shown on the latest ad valorem tax records of the county property appraiser. This notice shall be deemed complete and sufficient when so addressed and deposited in the United States mail with proper postage prepaid. The notice of violation shall inform the property owner that a violation of this article exists on the identified property with the description of the violation, that the property owner is responsible for maintaining the identified private stormwater system, that the property owner may allow the city access to the property to abate any public nuisance at the expense of the property owner, and that formal enforcement action will be taken if the violation is not corrected within the time period indicated on the notice. The stormwater utility manager shall determine a reasonable period of time for correction of the violation. In determining a reasonable period of time, the stormwater utility manager shall consider the following: practicality and ease of correction; the owner's ability to correct the violation; the severity of the violation; the nature, extent, and probability of danger to the public, and other relevant factors. Notice, as required under this provision, shall not be required: (a) when the stormwater utility manager determines that the violation presents an imminent endangerment to persons or property; (b) when a notice of violation has been sent to the same property owner or owners for the same violation within the previous three months; or (c) when notice by certified mail cannot be effected on the owners of record. The notice of violation shall contain substantially the following information and may be in the following form or other appropriate form: Notice of Violation: name of owner; address of owner; description of property; inspection date; determination made by the stormwater utility manager that the condition on the property is creating adverse conditions so as to constitute a violation of the this article; describe the conditions that caused the property to be in violation and any recommended actions that may be necessary to remedy the nuisance; specify a reasonable time period to proceed and remedy the nuisance; or provide written permission to the city to enter the site and abate the nuisance at owner's expense. Within the reasonable period of time for compliance specified in the notice of violation, the property owner shall either cure the violation or file a written request with city for a hearing before the city manager pursuant section 62-89 to show that the condition alleged in the notice does not exist or that such condition does not constitute a public nuisance in violation of the article. 
                  (d)  Alternately, in the event a public nuisance is deemed to exist by the stormwater utility manager or if a property owner fails to cure a violation pursuant to subsection (c) above, the city may elect to sue in a court of competent jurisdiction to abate such public nuisance. In the event a public nuisance is found by the court to exist, which the property owner fails to abate within such reasonable time as allowed by the court, the city may enter upon the property and cause work as is reasonably necessary to be performed, with the actual cost thereof assessed against the property owner in the same manner as a tax levied against the property. From date of filing of such abatement action, the city shall have lien rights which may be perfected, after judgment, by filing a notice of lien on the general execution docket of the Clerk of Gwinnett Superior Court.

                  Sec. 62-89. - Appeals. 
                  (a)  An appeal to the city manager may be taken by any property owner or customer aggrieved by any decision of the stormwater utility manager made pursuant to the provisions of this article. The appeal shall be taken within 30 days of the decision of the stormwater utility manager by filing with the city manager a notice of appeal in writing specifying the grounds thereof. Upon the filing of the notice of appeal, the stormwater utility manager shall forthwith transmit to the city manager all documentation constituting the record upon which the decision appealed from was taken. 
                  (b)  The city manager shall fix a reasonable time for hearing the appeal and give written notice, indicating the place, date and time of the meeting to hear the appeal, to the appellant at least ten days prior to the meeting date; provided, however, that such meeting may take place at any time agreed to in writing by the appellant. The meeting shall be open to the public, and the notice of such meeting shall be posted conspicuously at the place for notices in City Hall. After hearing the evidence, the city manager shall provide a written decision to the appellant. If the city manager's decision results in a refund or credit due to the property owner, then such refund or credit shall be calculated retroactive to the date of the initial appeal. 
                  (c)  The decision of the city manager may be appealed to the board of zoning appeals which shall administer the appeal in the manner set forth in article 13 of the development regulations for the City of Snellville. Any decision by the board of zoning appeals shall be final, and there shall be no further administrative action by the city. Any person aggrieved or dissatisfied with the decision of the board of zoning appeals may appeal that decision to the Superior Court of Gwinnett County by Writ of Certiorari.

                  f)  Agriculture, horticulture, silviculture, and/or pasture uses, provided that all applicable best management practices are used to minimize environmental impacts and such activities are not conducted within primary conservation areas; 
                  g)  Pastureland for horses and other grazing livestock used solely for recreational purposes. Equestrian facilities, including commercial facilities, shall be permitted but may not consume more than 25 percent of the minimum required greenway land. Outdoor riding arenas are permitted. Rodeo facilities, indoor arenas, seating areas, and facilities for audiences are specifically excluded; 
                  h)  Neighborhood uses such as village greens, commons, picnic areas, community gardens, trails, and similar low-impact passive recreational uses specifically excluding motorized off-road vehicles, rifle ranges, and other uses similar in character and potential impact as determined by the department of planning and development; 
                  i)  Golf courses may comprise up to 50 percent of the minimum required open space, but shall not include driving ranges or miniature golf. Golf course parking areas and any associated structures shall not count toward the minimum required area of open space; 
                  j)  Other conservation-oriented uses compatible with the purposes of this regulation. 
                  4.  Prohibited uses of open space shall include the following:

                  e)  Land area devoted to public or private streets or any land that has been, or is to be, conveyed to a public agency via a purchase agreement for such uses as parks, schools, or other public facilities shall not be credited. 
                  6.  Ownership. Open space shall be owned in fee-simple by a mandatory property owner's association; or other entity approved in advance by the mayor and city council during their normal course of business. The developer shall record the deed to the open space prior to, or concurrent with, the recording of the first final subdivision plat. An access easement following the alignment of future public streets is acceptable. However, "pocket parks" or "greens" may be deeded concurrent with the unit or phase of the final subdivision plat of which it is a part. 
                  7.  Property owner's association. The property owner's association bylaws or covenants, at a minimum, shall contain the following provisions: 
                  a)  Governance of the association by the Georgia Property Owner's Association Act (O.C.G.A. § 44-3-220 et seq.) or a successor to that Act that grants lien rights to the association for maintenance expenses and tax obligations. 
                  b)  Responsibility for maintenance of the open space. 
                  c)  Responsibility for insurance and taxes. 
                  d)  Automatic compulsory membership of all lot purchasers and their successors; and compulsory assessments.

                  f)  Guarantee that the association will not be dissolved without the advance approval of the mayor and city council. 
                  8.  Conservation surety. Open space delineated in the concept plan, except for "pocket parks" or "greens," shall be permanently protected by the conveyance of (i) a covenant or scenic easement which runs in perpetuity under O.C.G.A. § 44-5-60 in favor of any corporation, trust, or other organization holding land for the use of the public or certain governmental entities; or (ii) a conservation easement running in perpetuity to a third party "qualified organization" recognized by Federal Treasury Regulation section 1.170A-14(c)(1). Qualified organizations recognized by this treasury regulation include, but may not be limited to: governmental entities, certain publicly supported charities, local and national land trusts, or other conservation groups that are organized or operated primarily or substantially for one of the conservation purposes specified in the Internal Revenue Code. Governmental entities qualifying to be named in covenants under O.C.G.A. § 44-5-60 or to receive conservation easements under the treasury regulation referred to above for purposes of this ordinance shall include the federal government, the State of Georgia, Gwinnett County, or political subdivisions or authorities of the State of Georgia or Gwinnett County.

The developer shall record the necessary legal instrument to accomplish protection of the open space prior to, or concurrent with, the recording of the final subdivision plat. 
                  The instrument for permanent protection shall include clear restrictions on the use of the open space. These restrictions shall include all restrictions contained in this article, as well as any further restrictions the applicant chooses to place on the use of the open space or the mayor and council impose as a condition of zoning. 
                  9.  Maintenance. The property owner's association, or other entity approved in advance by the mayor and city council, shall be responsible for the continuous maintenance of buffers, open space and recreation areas. 
                  An open space management plan shall be prepared and submitted prior to the issuance of a site development permit. The open space management plan shall: 
                  a)  Allocate responsibility and guidelines for the maintenance and operation of the open space and any facilities located thereon, including provisions for ongoing maintenance and for long-term capital improvements; 
                  b)  Estimate the costs and staffing requirements needed for maintenance and operation of, and insurance for, the open space and outlines the means by which such funding will be obtained or provided; 
                  c)  Provide that any changes to the plan be approved by the mayor and council; and 
                  d)  Provide for enforcement of the plan. 
                  In the event the party responsible for maintenance of the open space fails to maintain all or any portion in reasonable order and condition, the City of Snellville may assume responsibility for its maintenance and may enter the premises and take corrective action, including the provision of extended maintenance. The costs of such maintenance may be charged to the Homeowner's Association, or to the individual property owners that make up the Homeowner's Association, and may include administrative costs and penalties. Such costs shall become a lien on all subdivision properties. 
                  10.  Tax assessment of open space: Once a legal instrument for permanent protection has been placed upon the open space, the City of Snellville shall reassess the open space at a lower value to reflect its more limited use.

                  6.4.4. - Other dead end streets. 
                  a.  A dead end street shall be provided to the boundary of a subdivision where necessary to provide access to a land-locked abutting property, for planned continuity of future circulation, for improved access for public safety vehicles, or for the extension of public water or other utilities to neighboring lands. Such dead end streets shall be designed so as to allow their reasonable extension, and shall be located so as to be reasonably incorporated into a street design for the neighboring property. The stub street requirement may be waived by the director of planning and development or his/her designee, in consultation with the director of the departments of public safety and the Gwinnett County Department of Public Utilities. 
                  b.  Dead end streets on abutting property shall be extended into a proposed subdivision and incorporated into the street design of the development. This requirement may be modified by the director of planning and development or his/her designee in cases of serious topographical hardship or dissimilar zoning which would create unacceptable land use conflicts between the two developments. This modification may be conflicts between the two developments. This modification may be conditioned on the provision of easements necessary for the extension of public utilities, the provision of cul-de-sac or other permanent turnaround on the dead end street, or the removal of the dead end street back to its nearest intersection. 
                  c.  Where a dead end street (other than a cul-de-sac) serves more than three lots, the developer shall be required to provide a temporary vehicular turnaround within the right-of-way. This requirement may be waived if extension of the dead end street is approved and under construction prior to its inclusion in a final plat. 
                  d.  Where a street dead ends at the property boundary and the street exceeds 1,000 feet in length, a permanent cul-de-sac shall be required. In this situation, right-of-way to the property boundary shall be required, but the pavement shall not be extended to the property boundary beyond the edge of the paved cul-de-sac turnaround. In no case shall a dead end street exceed 2,000 feet in length unless approved by the department due to unusual topographic conditions or property configuration.

                  6.5.6. - Street lights. 
                  The installation of all street lighting fixtures within city right-of-way must be approved by the department prior to such installation. 
                  a.  Within residential subdivisions, decorative street lighting approved by the director of the department of planning and development shall be used. Payment for the light pole, fixture and installation, and one year's power shall be supplied by the developer prior to final plat approval. 
                  b.  The following lighting standards shall be used. 
                  (1)  General provisions. 
                  (a)  Any lighting used to illuminate parking areas, access drives or loading areas shall be of such design or level of illumination so as to minimize the amount of ambient lighting perceptible from adjacent properties and that would impair the vision of motorists. 
                  (b)  Exterior architectural, display and decorative lighting visible from the street shall be generated from concealed, low-level light fixtures. 
                  (c)  Entrances into developments from a street may be lighted for traffic safety reasons provided such lighting does not exceed the foot candle requirements for lighting walkways and streets. 
                  (d)  The City of Snellville Mayor and Council will have the discretion to allow limited flexibility as to variations in the minimum and average levels if the proposed levels are below the ordinance standards, depending on site and traffic conditions. The city council will not allow flexibility for proposed levels which exceed the maximum levels, unless such levels strictly conform to the recommended levels within the IESNA Lighting Handbook, the accepted industry standards. 
                  (2)  Nonresidential lighting standards. 
                  (a)  All lighting fixtures designed or placed so as to illuminate any portion of a site shall meet the following requirements: 
                  (1)  Fixture (luminaries). Any lighting fixture shall be a cutoff luminary whose source is completely concealed with an opaque housing. Fixtures shall be recessed in the opaque housing. Drop dish refractors are prohibited. The wattage shall not exceed 420 watts/480V per light fixture. LED light sources shall have a color temperature of 4,000 Kelvin, 70 CRI, and initial lumens of 5,890. Provision includes lights on mounted poles as well as architectural display and decorative lighting visible from a street or highway. Wall pack lighting shall be cut-off down directional a maximum of 250 watts. Canopy lighting shall be cut-off luminaries with a maximum lamp wattage of 400 watts. 
                  (2)  Light source (lamp). Only light emitting diodes (LED), incandescent, fluorescent, metal halide, mercury vapor, natural gas, or color corrected high-pressure sodium (CRI of 60 or better) light may be used. The same type must be used for the same or similar type of lighting on any one site. 
                  (3)  Mounting. Fixtures must be mounted in such a manner that the cone of the light is not directed at any property line of site. The minimum mounting height for a pole is 12 feet. The maximum mounting height for a pole is 25 feet, excluding a three-foot base. Any fixture and pole locating within 20 feet of a residential zoning shall be type four or forward throw distribution. 
                  (4)  Illumination levels. All site lighting shall be designed so that the level of illumination as measured in foot-candles (fc) at any one point meets the following standards. Minimum and maximum levels are measured at any one point. Average level is not to exceed the calculated value, and is derived using only the area of the site included to receive illumination. Points of measure shall not include the area of the building or areas, which do not lend themselves to pedestrian traffic. Also if the major portion of the lighting design is to be in the front of a building, the average level should not be affected by adding a light or two in the back of the same building, which would raise the average of the intended area for lighting. 
                  (5)  Light shields shall be required upon the determination of the zoning enforcement officer. 
                  (6)  Future renovations, upgrades, or additions to such facilities in use prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this section derives shall not exceed existing illumination levels below. The entire site must be bought into conformance with this article should a renovation, upgrade, or addition occur. 
                  Illumination levels are as follows: 

                   
                  (b)  Requirements. 
                  (1)  A site lighting plan shall be submitted at one inch = 20 foot scale minimum. 
                  (2)  Site lighting plans shall include: 
                  (a)  Location and mounting information for each light; 
                  (b)  Illumination calculations showing light levels in foot candles at points located on a ten-foot center grid, including an illustration of the areas masked out per the requirements above regarding points of measurements; 
                  (c)  A fixture schedule listing fixture design, type of lamp, distribution and wattage of each fixture, and number of lumens after using 85 percent depreciation for both metal halide and high pressure sodium of initial output; (85 percent depreciation not applicable to recreational lighting); 
                  (d)  Manufacturer's photometric data for each type of light fixture, including initial lumens and mean depreciation values; 
                  (e)  An illumination summary, including the minimum average and maximum foot candle calculations ("array values") and the total number of array points (points used on the ten-foot grid calculations); 
                  (f)  Copies of all nema (fixture distribution) types with photometric reports in the form of independent testing laboratory submittals. Note: No isocandela curve reports will be accepted; and 
                  (g)  Photometric calculations shall be initial and maintained with aiming diagrams and mounting heights. 
                  (3)  Public or private outdoor recreational lighting. 
                  (a)  Light level on the playing field-quantity of illumination. The illumination level must satisfy the requirements of the players, as well as the spectators. The recreational facility shall be designed such that the maintained lighting level does not exceed the IESNA recommendations by more than 15 percent, as approved by the planning director or designee, for the specific sport and the level of play at the facility. 
                  (b)  Uniformity ratio. The uniformity ratio shall be in conformance with IESNA recommendations, for the specific type of field to be illuminated. 
                  (c)  Spill and glare control. 
                  (1)  Spill control. Illumination levels beyond the property line of the recreational facility, attributable to the recreational facility lighting system, shall not exceed the values (given in Table 1) on an adjacent residential property line or 150 feet, whichever is closer. Maximum values are given for both initial horizontal foot candles and initial vertical foot candles. Horizontal readings shall be measured at 36 inches above grade. Vertical foot candles readings shall be measured at 36 inches above grade with the meter aimed, in succession, at each light bank and the maximum foot candle reading recorded. 
                  (2)  Glare control. The luminaries shall be installed to operate, such that the candela value from an individual fixture does not exceed 12,000 candela at the angle above nadir shown in the table below. Different angles are used to more closely reflect the spill and glare concerns for the different environmental zones found throughout the City of Snellville. For further clarification, the value of 12,000 candela is used, as it closely approximates the intensity of light coming from a low beam headlight. 
                  Environmental Zones  (as defined in IESNA RP-33-99) 

                   

                   
                  (d)  Continuation of nonconforming sports lighting. The lawful use of existing lighted outdoor recreational facilities may be continued. Future renovations or upgrades to such facilities in use prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this section derives shall not exceed existing illumination levels beyond the perimeter of the recreational facility.

                  --- (5) --- 
                  Editor's note— An ordinance adopted June 28, 2004, deleted former art. 8 of the development regulations in its entirety and added new provisions as art. 8 to read as herein set out. Former art. 8, 8.1—8.9, pertained to similar subject matter and derived from an ordinance adopted March 22, 2004. 

                  8.1 - SITE GRADING 
                  8.1.1. - [Standards.] 
                  Grading shall be conducted in accordance with the lines and grades shown on the approved grading plan. 
                  (Ord. of 6-28-2004(5)) 
                  8.1.2. - [Grading plans.] 
                  Grading plans shall show existing and proposed contour lines at an interval of no more than two feet. Grading plans shall outline the areas, including dimensions, that are required to remain undisturbed (i.e., tree protection areas, buffer, etc.) and shall indicate protective fencing or staking to be placed surrounding such areas. 
                  (Ord. of 6-28-2004(5)) 
                  8.1.3. - [Property within jurisdiction of Metropolitan River Protection Act.] 
                  If the property is within the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan River Protection Act, the grading shall be consistent with the river corridor certificate approved for the project. 
                  (Ord. of 6-28-2004(5)) 
                  8.1.4. - [Embankments.] 
                  Embankments shall be placed in uniform layers not to exceed a compacted thickness of six inches per layer and shall be compacted to a density of 95 percent of the maximum laboratory dry weight per cubic foot as determined by AASHTO Method T-99 in all areas where structure, parking lots and drives, streets, and utilities are to be placed. All other embankments are to be compacted to at least 85 percent. 
                  (Ord. of 6-28-2004(5)) 
                  8.1.5. - [Slopes for cut or fill.] 
                  The maximum slopes for cut or fill shall be 2:1 (two feet of horizontal run for each foot of rise or fall), except 1) for earthen dam embankments, 2) for rock cuts, 3) where certified by a professional geotechnical engineer, or 4) as discussed in section 8.1.6 below. Earthen dam embankments shall be 3:1 maximum unless a modification application is approved. The intent of the earthen dam embankment slope regulation is to provide for public safety, soil stability, and dam maintenance considerations. The depth of cut referred to herein shall be the maximum cut or fill that shall be allowed to occur in any one section of cut or fill. The slope of cut or fill shall be uniform throughout for each section of cut or fill unless benching is approved by the department. When a cut is made in rock that requires blasting, the slope may be steeper if presplitting is employed and upon submission of a geotechnical report which substantiates the integrity of the rock in the steeper condition, subject to the review and approval of the director of planning and development or his/her designee. (Note: No blasting shall occur unless a permit has been obtained from the Gwinnett County Fire Marshall's office.) Refer to the standard drawings for grading section and retaining wall details.

                  8.1.6. - [Stabilizing slopes.] 
                  While most soils in the area can be safely stabilized at a 2:1 slope, some soils exhibit a low shearing resistance and a low cohesiveness. These soils typically are micaceous silts and sandy soils with little or no clay. If the 2:1 slope shows evidence of shearing, non-cohesiveness, sliding, or inability to maintain compaction, the slope shall be stabilized at 3:1 or by using such mechanical methods as needed (such as retaining walls or "grow mats" stapled in place) to maintain slope, height, and integrity. 
                  (Ord. of 6-28-2004(5)) 
                  8.1.7. - [Lot to lot drainage.] 
                  A grading plan showing building pad locations shall be completed for residential subdivisions, unless a modification application is approved, having a zoning that requires a lot size of less than 12,000 square feet or less or a density of four units per acre or more. The intent of this regulation is to ensure adequate lot to lot drainage. Granting a modification will not nullify the intent of these regulations when the layout has a minimum lot area of 14,520 square feet and a minimum lot width of 90 feet. The grading plan may be used as a construction document prior to approval of the final plat or as a guidance document for individual lot grading after approval of the final plat.

                  8.2. - STORMWATER MANAGEMENT 
                  8.2.1. - Storm water management report required. 
                  a.  Every project shall provide a storm water management report prepared by a professional engineer currently registered in the State of Georgia. The purpose of this report shall be to formulate a plan to manage storm water runoff so that storm water runoff hazards are not created and existing runoff-related problems are not exacerbated, either upstream or downstream from or within the boundaries of the property being developed. The engineer shall be responsible for obtaining all information necessary for the report. Hydrologic analysis and detention pond hydraulics (excluding dams as defined in section 8.6 of these regulations), pipe and open channel hydraulics, culvert hydraulics and water quality best management practices shall be certified by a professional engineer registered in the State of Georgia. Flood studies for any floodplain or flood prone areas, and hydrologic and hydraulic analysis and design calculations which are performed for the design of a dam as defined in section 8.6 of these regulations, shall be certified by a professional engineer registered in the State of Georgia. 
                  b.  The storm water management report shall identify the locations and quantities of storm water runoff entering and exiting the site for both pre- and post-developed conditions. Analysis of the off-site properties shall anticipate future development in addition to addressing existing conditions. It shall contain drainage area delineation maps and other exhibits at satisfactory scale and sufficient in quantity and scope to define the boundaries of the site relative to watercourses, drainage divides, drainage structures, and other pertinent features. 
                  All culverts, pipe systems and open channel flow systems shall be sized based on all on-site upstream areas being developed per the development plans and the off-site upstream areas being fully developed per the land use plan with no detention. Upstream detention may be included when determining flows, provided the engineer calculates the reduced flows by routing the developed flows through any storm water facility included in the analysis rather than assuming the reduction will occur. The engineer shall show that detention facilities used in the analysis will remain, be properly maintained and the storage volume and outlet structure is based on current conditions. 
                  Detention facilities shall be designed using pre-development flows based on existing conditions for all upstream areas including existing on-site lakes and detention. Post-development flows, except the 100-year flow, shall be based on on-site upstream areas being developed per the development plans and existing conditions for off-site upstream areas. The 100-year flow shall be based on on-site upstream areas being developed per the development plans and the off-site upstream areas being developed per the land use plan with no detention. Upstream detention may be included if it meets the conditions as described for culverts and pipe systems. Existing conditions shall be defined as the conditions of the site at the time of application for a land disturbance permit. The existing condition includes on-site lakes and ponds. Pre-development flows shall be determined by routing the pre-development flows through these storm water facilities. Flows used to size the outlet structures for detention facilities that exceed the 25-year design flow, shall be sized as described for culverts and pipe systems. 
                  When more than 50 percent of the property of a developed project site is disturbed for either redevelopment or improvement, the storm water management report shall be prepared for the entire site and existing impervious areas shall be treated as forest in the pre-developed analysis. When 50 percent or less of the property is disturbed, detention shall be provided as required by these regulations for the disturbed area and existing impervious areas which are disturbed shall be treated as forest in the pre-developed analysis. 
                  The report shall contain drainage area delineation maps and other exhibits at satisfactory scale and sufficient in quantity and scope to define the boundaries of the site and off-site areas relative to the watercourses, drainage divides, drainage structures and other pertinent features. The Gwinnett County Geographical Information System (GIS) mapping shall be used where appropriate. 
                  c.  For the purposes of these regulations, the words "downstream" and "analysis" shall have the following meanings. The analysis of downstream conditions in the report shall address each and every point or area along the project site's boundaries at which runoff will exit the property. The analysis shall focus on the portion of the drainageway "immediately" downstream from the project. This area shall extend downstream from the project to a point in the drainage basin where the project area is ten percent of the total basin area. 
                  (1)  The report shall examine the conditions downstream of the project to a point where the project area is ten percent of the total drainage basin. 
                  (a)  The analysis must include all culverts, obstructions, existing and potential erosion problems, elevations of existing improvements, existing drainage complaints and any other existing modifications to natural conditions. The downstream watercourses and receiving conveyance shall be analyzed to ensure that the channel velocities do not exceed values recommended in the Design Manual nor does the pipe system exceed current design criteria of these regulations, and, 
                  (b)  If the existing downstream conditions are overburdened by the pre-developed flows in the stream, then the developer shall work with the city to resolve the problem. The meaning of "overburdened" shall include but not be limited to situations where 25-year velocities exceed the non-erosive velocity of the stream, habitable structures are shown to be subject to flooding for any frequency up to and including the regulatory flood and storm water facilities that cannot carry the design storm in accordance with these regulations, and, 
                  (c)  If there are any problems identified downstream that are a result of the development, then the developer shall eliminate the conditions causing the problem. 
                  (2)  Hydrographs shall be analyzed at least at two points. One study point shall be at the downstream property line where the watercourse crosses the project site's downstream property line. The second study point shall be downstream of the project at the point where the project area is ten percent of the total drainage basin. 
                  (a)  The study will compare pre-developed hydrographs with post-developed hydrographs for the two, five, ten, 25, 50 and 100-year flood frequencies, and, 
                  (b)  Comparison of peak flows shall include the timing of the hydrographs, and, 
                  (c)  Hydrographs shall be based on a 24-hour storm. 
                  (d)  The analysis shall be in accordance with the Gwinnett County Storm Water Design Manual. 
                  d.  The following criteria shall be evaluated by the engineer preparing the storm water management report and in determining whether or not detention should be required for any portion of any site: 
                  (1)  Existing land uses downstream, 
                  (2)  Anticipated future land uses downstream, 
                  (3)  Magnitude of increase in peak flows due to development, 
                  (4)  Presence of existing drainage problems, 
                  (5)  Capacity of existing and anticipated drainage systems, 
                  (6)  Creation of concentrated flows where none had occurred previously, 
                  (7)  Availability of feasible locations for detention facilities, 
                  (8)  Existing flows generated off-site which pass through the project site, and, 
                  (9)  The nature of the receiving watercourse. 
                  e.  Where detention for a proposed project is provided in a regional detention facility that was permitted prior to January 1, 2001, the developer shall provide a copy of the original study that met the regulations at the time the facility was permitted. If the approved study cannot be found, then the engineer shall provide a recreated study. The project shall be exempt from restudy and any modifications required to meet regulations effective after January 1, 2001, provided the proposed project is in keeping with the intent of the original detention study and the detention facility is maintained. 
                  f.  When a development uses an existing facility where the last approved certification and record drawing of the facility was over 18 months prior to the new development's submittal, the engineer shall provide one of the following. 
                  (1)  A new survey, drawing and certification showing that the outlet structure is constructed as approved and the flood storage and water quality volume of the facility is equal to or greater than the volume required when the facility was approved. 
                  (2)  Construction plans and calculations showing that the outlet structure will function as designed and the flood storage and water quality volume of the facility will be equal to or greater than the volume required when the facility was approved once the proposed maintenance has been performed. 
                  (3)  A new record survey, drawing, study and certification showing that the facility meets the development requirements when the facility was approved. 
                  f.  Design Criteria—General. All design related to storm water shall be in accordance with the Gwinnett County Storm Water Design Manual. 
                  g.  Evidence of acquisition of applicable non-local permits. The applicant shall certify and provide documentation that all other applicable environmental permits have been acquired for the site prior to approval of the storm water management report. 
                  (Ord. of 6-28-2004(5)) 
                  8.2.2. - Storm water detention required. 
                  a.  Whenever a storm water management report indicates that an adverse impact from storm water runoff related impact is expected to result from the development of a property, that project shall be required to provide storm water detention facilities. The meaning of "adverse impact" shall apply when pre-developed flows did not cause difficulties and post-development flows do. Difficulties shall include but not be limited to situations where 25-year velocities exceed the non-erosive velocity of the stream, habitable structures are shown to be subject to increased depth of flooding for any frequency up to and including the regulatory flood and storm water facilities that cannot carry the design storm in accordance with these regulations. 
                  b.  Stormwater detention facilities required in section 8.2.2.a shall be provided, unless the registered professional engineer currently registered in the State of Georgia certifies and provides certified documentation supporting the conclusion to the director of planning and development or his/her designee that at least one of the following is true and correct as applicable. 
                  (1)  The non-detained, post-development runoff will leave the project site as sheet flow, and will not have an adverse impact upon downstream properties. The increase for a 25-year storm should not exceed one cfs over a length perpendicular to the flow of 100 feet. 
                  (2)  The effect of detention would be to concentrate flows where sheet flow had occurred under pre-developed conditions, and any impact of increase sheet flows upon downstream properties would be less adverse than that which would result from the concentrated flows from a detention facility even if energy dissipation devices were employed. 
                  (3)  The undetained flow will pass through downstream properties, in drainage easements obtained by the developer, to an existing detention facility that has been designed to manage the upstream property's runoff or to the point in the downstream analysis (see 8.2.1.c) which shows that detention is not required. 
                  (4)  Where the site runoff will flow directly into a stream or lake without crossing off-site properties: 
                  (a)  24-hour detention of the one-year storm is required if water quality protection is required for the project. 
                  (b)  Only peak detention for the two-year though the 25-year storm is not required if the downstream analysis using timing of the hydrographs shows no adverse impact from the exit of the site to the point immediately downstream from the project in the drainage basin where the project area is 10 percent of the total basin area. 
                  c.  Should the professional engineer conclude that storm water detention might not be necessary because of anticipated compliance with section 8.2.2.b., rigid compliance with all of the following criteria is mandatory: 
                  (1)  A storm water management report shall always be required whether or not storm water detention is required. 
                  (2)  If the applicant proposes to show that the detention requirement may be eliminated for all or a portion of a project, then a pre-submittal conference with the Department staff is required prior to preparation and submittal of construction plans for the project. 
                  (3)  At the pre-submittal conference with the staff, the consultant shall be prepared to discuss the downstream analysis findings as follows: 
                  (a)  The affected stream must be analyzed downstream from the project to a point where the project area is ten percent of the total drainage basin. The analysis must include all culverts, obstructions, existing and potential erosion problems, elevations of existing improvements, and any other existing modifications to natural conditions; and, 
                  (b)  If the existing downstream conditions are overburdened by the pre-developed flows in the stream, then detention shall be required unless the developer elects to eliminate the downstream overburdened conditions at his or her expense when the development occurs; 
                  (c)  If there are any existing drainage complaints downstream, then detention shall be required unless the developer elects to minimize the conditions causing the complaint at his or her expense when the development occurs. 
                  (Ord. of 6-28-2004(5); Ord. of 4-25-2005(1)) 
                  8.2.3 - Detention design criteria—General. 
                  a.  All storm water detention design calculations shall be certified by a professional engineer currently registered in the State of Georgia. 
                  b.  All storm water detention facilities shall be designed to detain the one-year storm runoff, for the area draining to the pond, for 24 hours. For the project, this volume called the channel protection volume, shall be equal to or greater than the one-year storm runoff volume from the project. In addition, these facilities shall control the peak flow rates associated with storms having two-year, five-year, ten-year, and 25-year return frequencies so that flows from the developed site do not exceed those associated with pre-development conditions at the project boundary nor increase the peak flows downstream from the project to the point in the drainage basin where the project area is ten percent of the total basin. Where adverse impacts, as defined in section 8.2.2.a, occur during the 100-year storm, the 100-year storm shall also be regulated. 
                  c.  A variety of methods of achieving storm water management goals shall be acceptable in providing detention facilities. The type of facility provided shall be based on the following criteria: 
                  (1)  The type of development which the detention facility is being provided, 
                  (2)  The type of development which the detention facility is intended to protect, 
                  (3)  Volume of storm water to be stored, 
                  (4)  Origin and magnitude of the flows to be managed, 
                  (5)  Topographic opportunities and limitations, 
                  (6)  Safety considerations, 
                  (7)  Maintenance requirements, 
                  (8)  Aesthetic considerations, 
                  (9)  Likelihood of facility operation interfering with access to public or private facilities, 
                  (10)  Proximity of facility to property lines, utilities, buffers, etc., and; 
                  (11)  Similar site-specific constraints. 
                  d.  Detention facilities may be of any of the following types, and two or more types may be used in combination with one another: 
                  (1)  Normally-dry basins, whether excavated or created by damming a natural drainage feature, or a combination of both methods, 
                  (2)  Lakes and ponds, whether excavated or created by damming a natural drainage feature, or a combination of both methods, 
                  (3)  Parking lot facilities, 
                  (4)  Underground facilities, and 
                  (5)  Roof top facilities. 
                  e.  Reservoir routing methods shall be used for all detention facility design. The size of the orifice to detain the one-year storm for the facility shall be computed using the following orifice equation with a 24-hour draw down time from the elevation of the total channel protection volume (CPV) and an orifice coefficient of 0.60. The minimum elevation of the two-year control shall be at the maximum routed pool elevation of the one-year storm and not the pool elevation of the total one-year storm volume. 

                   
                  f.  The detention methodology used for any given project shall conform to the Gwinnett County Storm Water Design Manual. 
                  g.  Runoff coefficients and runoff curve numbers used for pre- and post-development conditions shall be consistent with those shown in the Gwinnett County Storm Water Design Manual. The USGS method shall be used where applicable to check the magnitude of peak flows when other hydrologic methods recommended in the manual are used. 
                  h.  Calculations shall be provided showing how all times of concentration or lag times were computed, both for pre- and post-developed conditions. Likewise, adequate support must be provided for all composite runoff coefficients or curve numbers used. 
                  i.  If a computer program is used for hydrologic and hydraulic analysis and design, including generating and routing hydrographs, the output from the program shall be summarized in the storm water management report, and the name and version of the program shall be indicated. Computer output sheets shall be attached to the report as required to substantiate the input parameters used in the computer evaluation. 
                  j.  The design of every detention facility of any type shall consider the effects both of inflows in excess of those the facility is designed to accommodate and of malfunctioning of the primary outlet system. A safe path for overflow condition flows shall be provided. 
                  k.  Weirs shaped like a "V" (V-notch weirs) shall be used where practical, considering structural or hydrological concerns. 
                  l.  Prior to beginning the design of the storm water detention facility, the design engineer shall submit a concept plan outlining the proposed system which will include as a minimum the following items: 
                  (1)  Pre-development and post-development drainage basin maps, 
                  (2)  Proposed site plan sketch (to scale) showing major site items, contours and all impervious areas, 
                  (3)  Locations, approximate size and type of all BMP and detention facilities. 
                  The concept plan will be reviewed and agreed upon between the director of planning and development or his/her designee and the design engineer and will form the basis for the final storm water facility design. 
                  m.  In residential subdivisions, no more than 50 percent of the basin perimeter may be a wall of any type. 
                  (Ord. of 6-28-2004(5); Ord. of 4-25-2005(1)) 
                  8.2.4. - Detention facility location criteria. 
                  a.  For purposes of these regulations, a detention facility shall be deemed to consist of the area within the maximum design ponding limits (100-year ponding limit) unless a modification application is approved, the dam (if one) including all embankment slopes and wall footings (if applicable), primary and emergency outlet works, any drainage and access easements, and any energy dissipation devices. The intent of these regulations is to ensure that the extent of the facility is defined to allow flooding, access and maintenance. Granting of a modification will not nullify these regulations. When the facility is a wet pond or lake, the area within the maximum design ponding limits is reduced to a few feet inside the normal pool elevation, and easements are provided on the perimeter properties to allow for flooding, access and maintenance around the lake. In addition, granting of the modification shall only be considered when the wet pond is an amenity and under no circumstances shall the dam and outlet structure lie on private property. 
                  b.  Detention facilities, to the greatest extent feasible, shall be located so as to minimize the amount of flow generated on-site which by-passes the facility. 
                  c.  No portion of any detention facility shall disturb any required (as opposed to voluntary) buffer, landscape strip, or tree protection area, except that natural bottom detention ponds and its appurtenant structures, which require no grading and removal of trees, may encroach into a required construction buffer. 
                  d.  The 100-year ponding limits of a detention facility shall not encroach upon a public right-of-way. 
                  e.  Detention facilities may be located within utility easements or rights-of-way, or encroach upon utility easements or rights-of-way, upon receipt by the Department of written permission from both the property and utility owners. 
                  f.  Detention facilities may be constructed within recreation areas required under section 5.9 of these regulations, if the following criteria are met: 
                  (1)  Ownership of the area will be held by a qualified property owners association, homeowners association, or other private parties. 
                  (2)  Permanent structures, such as buildings and swimming pools, will not be constructed within the boundaries of the detention facility. 
                  (3)  Detention facilities within recreation areas will be approved only if the design of the area includes recreation amenities such as ball fields, tennis courts, grassed open areas or other similar improvements. The intent is to provide recreation facilities with detention as a secondary feature. 
                  (4)  Permanent detention features shall not interfere with the intended use of the recreation amenity, (i.e., a ditch or large swale shall not traverse a ball field, an inlet structure shall not be in a tennis court, etc.). 
                  g.  If a subdivision (residential or non-residential) project is provided with an on-site detention facility not located within a recreation area as specified in 8.2.4.f. above, a property owners association shall be established for its ownership and maintenance. The facility shall be located on a single lot within the development and owned by the property owners association. The association bylaws shall be recorded concurrently with the recording of a final subdivision plat. The association bylaws shall include the same provisions as specified in subsection 5.8.1, paragraph b. of this regulation. 
                  h.  If a residential subdivision is provided with an on-site detention facility not located within a recreation area as specified in 8.2.4.g above, a mandatory property owners' association shall be established for its ownership and maintenance. The facility shall be located on a single lot within the development and owned by the property owners' association. The lot shall have a minimum of 30 feet of public road frontage and a minimum lot width of 30 feet. If the project is provided with an off-site detention facility, a mandatory property owners' association shall be established for its maintenance. The association bylaws shall be recorded concurrently with the recording of a final subdivision plat. The association bylaws shall include the same provisions as specified in subsection 5.9.1, paragraph b. of this regulation. 
                  i.  A non-residential subdivision is not required to locate an on-site detention facility on a separate lot. The property owners served by a detention facility that provides detention for more than one property owner or is located off-site shall enter into a maintenance agreement with the city for the facility's maintenance. However, if desired by the developer, the facility may be located on a separate lot if it is owned and maintained by a mandatory property owner's association.

                  8.2.5. - Detention facility easement requirements. 
                  a.  In a non-residential subdivision or project, an easement at least 20 feet in width shall be required so as to provide access to all detention facilities from a public street. 
                  b.  In a residential subdivision, an easement at least 30 feet in width shall be required so as to provide access to all detention facilities from a public street. 
                  c.  Access easement. 
                  (1)  The access easement shall be cleared, grubbed and graded so that it can be utilized by rubber-tired construction vehicles. 
                  (2)  The minimum drive width shall be 15 feet. 
                  (3)  The drive shall be grassed or paved. 
                  (4)  The maximum slope shall be 20 percent (5H:1V). 
                  (5)  Access easements may be combined with drainage easements containing an open channel; however, the combined easement shall be a minimum of 30 feet in width and shall be wide enough for the drainage channel and the drive. 
                  d.  Every normally dry detention basin, lake, or parking lot detention facility shall be completely enclosed within a drainage easement. The drainage easement shall extend at least ten feet beyond the 100-year flooding limits of the detention facility.

                  8.2.6. - Detention facility maintenance. 
                  a.  The detention storage capacity or function of any detention basin, pond or other impoundment, whether natural or man-made, shall not be removed or diminished without the express approval of the department. 
                  b.  In a residential subdivision, it shall be the responsibility of the mandatory property owners' association to maintain the operational characteristics of any facility constructed on their property for storm water detention pursuant to City requirements, to keep the access drive free of obstructions, and to maintain the facility free of obstruction, silt or debris.

                  8.7. - EXTENDED DETENTION. 
                  8.7.1. - Wet extended detention facility design requirements. 
                  Wet detention facilities shall be designed and constructed to meet the following requirements: 
                  a.  Minimum and maximum drainage area. The minimum drainage area for a wet detention facility should be at least 20 acres. The maximum drainage area should be 100 to 300 acres. The maximum drainage area of highly impervious drainage areas should be restricted to the lower end of the range (100 acres) and low density residential watersheds should be restricted to a maximum of 300 acres. 
                  b.  Storage volume of permanent pool. The permanent pool storage (Vb) shall be at least 50 percent of the water quality volume (WQV) defined in section 8.9.1. The part of the WQV (50 percent or less) not used in the permanent pool shall be detained for 24 hours and the storage volume may be used as part of the detention requirements. The WQV to be stored shall be based upon the project area. The project area compensated for in a pond shall not exceed the total drainage area draining to the pond. Off-site areas that do not drain through other water quality BMP's may be used to compensate for areas that by-pass the pond. By-passed areas shall be minimized as much as practical. Off-site areas exceeding the project site area may bypass the pond. 

                  Wet Pond Diagram 
                  c.  Depth of permanent pool. 
                  (1)  Mean depth. The mean depth (Z) of the permanent pool shall be between three feet and seven feet and is calculated by dividing the permanent pool storage volume (Vb) by the surface area (As) [(Vb)/(As) = Z]. 
                  (2)  Maximum depth. The maximum depth of the permanent pool shall be no greater than 12 feet unless a modification is approved. The intent of these regulations is to ensure that the depth of the facility is not out of proportion with the surface area of the facility. Granting of a modification will not nullify these regulations when the depth and surface area of the facility is based on existing natural topography. 
                  d.  Minimum surface area of permanent pool. The minimum surface area (As) of the permanent pool shall be 0.25 acres. The minimum ratio of surface area to drainage area used to calculate the permanent pool (Aw) in residential watersheds shall be one percent unless a modification is approved. The intent of these regulations is to ensure that the depth is minimized to increase removal efficiencies. Granting of a modification will not nullify these regulations when the depth and surface area of the facility is based on existing natural topography. As/Aw ratios in excess of three percent are desirable for nonresidential watersheds with relatively high levels of imperviousness. 
                  e.  Side slopes along the shoreline. 
                  (1)  The side slope in graded areas is recommended to be 3H:1V or flatter. When the depth of the permanent pool is greater than four feet and the slope is steeper than 4H:1V, a bench shall be provided. The bench shall be ten feet in width and is recommended to be 15 feet in width. The bench shall have a slope of 10H:1V. The bench shall be located so that the permanent pool elevation is between the top and bottom edge of the bench. See storm water standard drawing. 
                  (2)  Side slopes shall be topsoiled, nurtured or planted from two feet below to one foot above the permanent pool control elevation to promote wetland vegetative growth. Below the safety ledge, the pond side shall be sloped to meet topographic or volumetric constraints. 
                  f.  Length to width ratio of permanent pool. The minimum length: width ratio of the permanent pool shall be 2:1. The length shall be measured at the shortest flow path from the inlet to the outlet. The width shall be calculated as the surface of the pond divided by the length. In addition, the location of the outlet structure within the basin shall maximize travel time from the inlet to the outlet. Baffles or islands may be installed within the permanent pool to increase the flow path length and to minimize short-circuiting. 
                  g.  Soil permeability. In some cases where relatively permeable soils are encountered, water drawdown rates shall be minimized by either compacting the permanent pool soils during construction, incorporating clay into the soil or by installing an artificial liner. 
                  h.  Spillway and dam design. The principal spillway, emergency spillway and dam shall be designed in accordance with sections 8.2, 8.6 and 9.8 of these regulations. 
                  i.  Forebay. 
                  (1)  To facilitate major cleanout activities, a sediment forebay shall be constructed near the inlet to the permanent pool to trap coarse sediment particles. The forebay volume may be included in the permanent pool volume requirements. The forebay storage capacity shall be ten percent of the runoff from 1.2 inches of rainfall draining to the facility to accommodate sediment accumulations. The forebay should not exceed ten percent of the permanent pool. The volume shall be calculated as: 
                  FBV = (0.1)1.2(Rv)A S /12(ft 3 ) 
                  Where Rv = 0.05 +I(0.009) 
                  I = Percent impervious as a whole number 
                  A S = Total on-site area draining to facility (ft 2 ) 
                  (2)  The facility shall be dredged to ensure that all of the permanent pool storage volume is available after the upstream area has been stabilized. All temporary sediment control measures employed during land disturbing activities to trap sediment shall be located outside of state waters. 
                  (3)  The forebay shall be distinguished from the permanent pool. Options which may be used include: a lateral sill with wetland vegetation; two ponds in series; differential pool depth; rock-filled gabions or a retaining wall; or a horizontal rock filter placed laterally across the permanent pool. 
                  j.  Inlet and outlet structures. 
                  (1)  The inlet design shall dissipate flow energy and diffuse the inflow plume where it enters the forebay or permanent pool. Options which may be used include: drop manholes; energy dissipaters at the bottom of paved ditches; a lateral bench with wetland vegetation and the placement of large rock deflectors at each inlet. 
                  (2)  The outlet design shall consist of a riser with a hood or trash rack to prevent clogging and an adequate antivortex device for facilities serving large drainage areas. The outlet may be sized to achieve the flood control performance standards contained in sections 8.2, 8.6 and 9.8 of these regulations. An emergency spillway shall be provided in accordance with section 9.8.4 of these regulations. 
                  (3)  The channel which receives the discharge from the basin's outfall pipe shall be protected from erosive discharge velocities. Options which may be used include: rip rap lining of the channel; the provision of stilling basins, check dams, rock deflectors or other devices to reduce outfall discharge velocities to non-erosive levels. 
                  (4)  An orifice for any required extended detention volume shall be sized using the same criteria as required in section 8.7.2. 
                  k.  Access. Access requirements shall be as specified in section 8.2.5 of these regulations. 
                  l.  Easement requirements. Easement requirements shall be as specified in section 8.2.5 of these regulations with the change that the easement enclosing the facility shall be named a best management practice (BMP) easement. 
                  m.  Engineer's certification and record drawings. A certified record survey of each facility shall be prepared by a land surveyor currently registered in the State of Georgia. A certified record drawing of the facility shall be prepared based upon this survey. The design engineer shall certify that the facility functions hydraulically as designed. The record drawing shall be submitted to the city at least one week prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy or final plat approval (as appropriate to the project). Record drawings of off-site facilities shall be recorded at least one week prior to the recording of the subdivision final plat.

                  Extended detention facilities with wetland plantings shall be designed and constructed to meet the following requirements: 
                  a.  Maximum drainage area. The maximum drainage area for which the facility shall be allowed to be constructed should be 20 acres (DA = drainage area in acres); 
                  b.  Storage volume. The water quality volume (WQV) to be stored is defined in section 8.9.1. Up to 50 percent of the storage volume shall be detained for 24 hours and may be used for detention requirements. The remaining portion (50 percent or greater) shall be drained through a filter drain in 24 hours. The filter drain shall be the only outlet draining the WQV. 
                  S = BMP storage volume in cubic feet; 
                  DRY POND DIAGRAM 
                  c.  Minimum surface area. The facility should have a minimum surface area of one percent of the total drainage area when the volume contained in the facility equals the required BMP storage volume; 
                  d.  Side slopes along the shoreline. The side slope in graded areas shall be 3H:1V or flatter. The normal ponding surface elevation shall be defined as the elevation when the volume contained in the facility equals the required water quality volume. When the depth to the normal ponding surface is greater than four feet and the side slope is steeper than 4H:1V, a flat bench shall be provided. The bench shall be at least ten feet in width and is recommended to be 15 feet in width. The slope of the bench shall be 10H:1V. The bench shall be located so that the normal ponding surface elevation is between the top and bottom edge of the bench. See storm water standard drawing. 
                  e.  Length: width ratio. The length: width ratio shall be maximized. The length shall be measured as the shortest flow path from the inlet to the outlet. The width shall be calculated as the surface area of the pond divided by the length. 
                  f.  Depth of facility. The average cross-sectional area of the facility shall be calculated as the volume of the pond divided by the length. The water velocity shall be determined by dividing the maximum outflow rate by the average cross-sectional area. The maximum desired water velocity shall be 0.5 feet per second. 
                  g.  Spillway and dam design. The principal spillway, emergency spillway and dam shall be designed in accordance with sections 8.2, 8.6, and 9.8 of these regulations. 
                  h.  Forebay. The forebay requirements are the same as for wet extended detention (section 8.7.1.i). 
                  i.  Inlet and outlet structures. 
                  (1)  Inlet and outlet structures shall meet the same requirements as wet detention facilities.

                  Footnotes: 
                  --- (6) --- 
                  Editor's note— An ordinance adopted June 28, 2004, deleted former art. 9 of the development regulations in its entirety and added new provisions as art. 9 to read as herein set out. Former art. 9, 9.1—9.9, pertained to similar subject matter and derived from an ordinance adopted March 22, 2004. 

                  9.1. - GENERAL. 
                  9.1.1. - Purpose. 
                  The sections enumerated in this article are guidelines, and are intended to be benchmark indicators of what standards could be acceptable. They are further intended to allow alternate designs that could produce results similar to these performance standards and similar protection to the public. The objective of these performance standards is not to suggest a single methodological standard of acceptance exclusive of all others. Rather they establish what would otherwise be allowed in the absence of an acceptable alternative. 
                  (Ord. of 6-28-2004(5)) 
                  9.1.2. - Constraints. 
                  The alternative design solutions are constrained by the design requirements of article 5, the access requirements and street and right-of-way requirements and the street construction standards of article 6, and the grading, detention, drainage requirements of article 8, as well as the purpose and intent of these regulations. 
                  (Ord. of 6-28-2004(5)) 
                  9.1.3. - Documentation required. 
                  In the event that an alternative is suggested by the applicant, studies and reports conducted by professionals currently certified in the State of Georgia will be required to be submitted to and approved by the department. These studies and reports must clearly relate to the desired results and purposes expressed or implied in the applicable performance standard. Once an alternative has been approved by the department, it shall become a required standard applicable to the specific approved permit only. 
                  (Ord. of 6-28-2004(5)) 
                  9.2. - LOTS. 
                  9.2.1. - [General standards.] 
                  Lots should be designed generally such that they are no more than four times as deep as they are wide at the building setback line, unless accepted by the director. 
                  a.  The department may require notation that a house location plan (HLP) is required to be approved prior to issuance of a building permit on certain lots when particular care in locating the house or other improvements will be necessary. Such lots include, but are not limited to: 
                  (1)  A lot which presents particular or unusual difficulties for a builder to meet minimum required building setbacks; 
                  (2)  A lot upon which is located an easement of unusual configuration; 
                  (3)  A lot containing floodplain but upon which no fill or other encroachment into the floodplain is anticipated at the time the final plat is filed; 
                  (4)  A lot upon which is located all or a part of a stormwater detention facility; 
                  (5)  A lot upon which is located a buffer which was required by the zoning ordinance as a condition of zoning approval; 
                  (6)  All duplex lots; 
                  b.  The department may require notation that a residential drainage plan (RDP) is required to be approved prior to issuance of a building permit on certain lots where additional (site specific) engineering will be necessary to properly grade the lot or locate the building or other improvements. Such lots include, but are not limited to: 
                  (1)  A lot containing floodplain where fill or other encroachment into the floodplain is planned or reasonably expected; 
                  (2)  A lot containing severe topographic features interdicting the building site; 
                  (3)  A lot containing a drainage easement with a pipe discharge or other facilities, or flow characteristics which may adversely affect the location of a building or other site improvements. 
                  c.  The department may require notation that a residential drainage study (RDS) is required to be approved prior to issuance of a building permit on certain lots where particular attention to site grading will be necessary, but formal engineering is not needed. Such a RDS is conducted in the field where the effect of the site grading must be accomplished with adequate care so as not to create a drainage problem on neighboring property.

                  9.2.2. - [Side lot line requirements.] 
                  Side lot lines generally should be at right angles (90 degrees) to straight street lines or radial to curved street lines as much as practical. Side lot lines should be radial to the radius points of all cul-de-sacs. Variations of more than ten degrees shall require approval of the department, but shall be approved when appropriate to the reasonable loading pattern of the subdivision, efficient use of the land relative to topographic conditions, or provisions of improved building sites over those which would result without variation of the side lot lines.

                  The lengths, widths, and shapes of blocks shall be determined with regard to: 
                  a.  Provision of adequate building sites suitable to the special needs of the type of use contemplated, 
                  b.  Applicable zoning requirements as to lot size and dimensions, 
                  c.  Needs for convenient access, circulation, control, and safety of street traffic, 
                  d.  Limitations and opportunities of topography.

                  9.3.2. - [Pedestrian access easements.] 
                  In blocks over 1,000 feet long, the director may, when existing or proposed pedestrian circulation patterns or public gathering places so justify, require pedestrian ways or pedestrian access easements, as appropriate, through the block. 
                  (Ord. of 6-28-2004(5)) 
                  9.4. - ACCESS. 
                  A maximum number of 200 residential dwelling units shall be allowed to be constructed with only one street outlet to an existing public street. If a second access to an existing public road is not available or, in the opinion of the director of planning and development or his/her designee, could induce non-residential traffic through the development, a single entrance may be allowed if designed with a traffic signal and/or sufficient right-of-way and improvements to provide a protected left-turn lane, subject to the approval of the director of planning and development or his/her designee.

                  b.  Minimum grade of less than 1.5 percent on a local street may be approved by the department, based on adequate engineering designs, where at least 1.5 percent cannot reasonably be achieved due to topographical limitations imposed by the land. In such cases, a record drawing and such computations as necessary shall be provided after construction to establish that the street will drain in accordance with these regulations. Street sections where unacceptable pooling, excessive spread at catch basins, or other hazardous conditions occur shall be reconstructed or otherwise improved to eliminate such conditions. 
                  c.  Minimum vehicle design speeds and maximum grades allowable in the City of Snellville by street classification shall be as shown in table 9-A.

                  9.5.2. - Vertical street alignment. 
                  a.  All changes in street profile grades having algebraic difference greater than one percent shall be connected by a parabolic curve having a minimum length (L) equal to the product of the algebraic difference between the grades in percent (A) and the design constant (K) assigned to the street according to its category (i.e., L=KA). 
                  b.  Constant (K) values are shown in the table 9-B for both desirable and minimum acceptable ("hardship") conditions. In all cases, the "desirable" value shall be used, unless it cannot be achieved due to topographic conditions beyond the developer's control. In such hardship situations, the department may approve a lesser value to the extent required by the hardship situation, but in no event less than the value shown in the table as "minimum."

                  *No superelevation will be allowed on minor collectors internal to residential subdivisions. 
                  b.  Superelevation for horizontal curves shall be calculated utilizing the following formula: 

                   

                   
                  c.  Widening section along existing streets shall be designed reflecting existing curvature and superelevation, if any, unless the existing street has been included in a specific design by the County or Georgia D.O.T. which calls for different standards, in which case the project will be coordinated with the overall design. 
                  d.  Superelevation runoff. Roadway edge curves shall be provided for tangent runout (bringing edge from a normal crown to centerline elevation) and superelevation runoff (from the end of tangent runout to the point of design superelevation) in accordance with design standards of the Georgia Department of Transportation or other professional engineering standards. 
                  e.  Tangents and compound curves. Between reverse horizontal curves there shall be not less than the minimum centerline tangents shown in table 9-D unless otherwise specified by the Georgia Department of Transportation. Compound radii curves are prohibited. At least the "desirable" length shall be provided unless hardship conditions of topography or property configuration will not allow lengths greater than those shown as "minimum." For compound circular curves, the ratio of the flatter radius to the sharper radius shall not exceed 1.5 to one.

                  9.8. - STORMWATER DETENTION GUIDELINES. 
                  9.8.1. - General. 
                  a.  Stormwater detention facilities shall be designed so that their peak release rates, when combined with those of all detention bypass areas in the same basin, produce peak flowrates and flow velocities at the site's boundary line no greater than those which occurred at the same location for pre-developed conditions. 
                  b.  The positive effects of stormwater management via on-site detention facilities diminish rapidly as the distance downstream from the point of distance increases, and the smaller the facility's contribution is, as a percentage of the total runoff contributing to downstream flow, the shorter the distance downstream that the benefits are realized. Because of these limitations, on-site detention is effective at controlling flooding only when flow from the facility is a significant percentage of the total flow at the point of interest, and only if the point of interest is "immediately" downstream. The concepts of "immediately" downstream and "significant percentage of total flow are inseparable." The portion of a receiving watercourse (one which receives and conveys runoff from a site) which lies downstream from the site to the point where the project area is ten percent of the total drainage area, shall generally be considered to constitute that portion of the watercourse which is "immediately" downstream. However, the total flow in the receiving watercourse may become very large, relative to the flow contributed by the project site, within a much shorter distance. For this reason, the "significant percentage" test must also always be applied. For purposes of these Regulations, the flow from a site represents a "significant percentage" of the total flow in a watercourse only when the ratio of the peak flow rate from the site to the peak flowrate in the watercourse (including the contribution from the project site) is greater than five percent. 
                  c.  Peak flowrate control shall normally be provided for the two-year, five-year, ten-year, and 25-year frequency storm events. However, under certain conditions, the 100-year event must also be detained to the pre-developed rate. Such control of the 100-year event shall be provided when failure to do so would result in flooding of other habitable dwellings, property damage, or public access and/or utility interruption. 
                  d.  For any stormwater analysis, the composite "C" (Rational Method) or CN (SCS Method) used for analysis of pre-development conditions shall not exceed 0.25 or 60, respectively, unless prior approval has been obtained from the department. A pre-design conference between the design engineer and appropriate department personnel, which may in certain straightforward cases be conducted via the telephone, is required. 
                  e.  Rational method runoff coefficients used for analysis of pre- and post development conditions shall be consistent with those shown in the Gwinnett County Storm Water Design Manual. 
                  f.  In circumstances where previously exempt sites (i.e. residential) are being converted to commercial developments or where existing commercial, industrial or institutional developed sites with inadequate or non-existent storm water detention facilities are being expanded, improved or renovated, the site shall be brought into conformity to these requirements assuming the site to be undeveloped with a runoff coefficient no greater than 0.25 or a CN no greater than 55. The director of planning and development or his/her designee may take existing site conditions and other pertinent facts into consideration to grant partial relief from full compliance or to impose stricter undeveloped site conditions if in his opinion these circumstances so warrant.

                  9.8.2. - Dam design and construction criteria. 
                  a.  Detention facilities which take the form of normally-dry basins, ponds, or lakes usually are created by damming a drainageway or watercourse. Such dams can take a variety of different forms, the most common being earthen embankments and reinforced concrete walls. Each type of dam has different characteristics, and the selection of the most appropriate type for a particular site should be made by a professional engineer and based on the physical features of the dam site, the purpose of the dam, the type of impoundment, safety, and maintenance requirements. 
                  b.  For purposes of these regulations, dams will be addressed separately for each of the three most frequently encountered types of detention facilities: normally-dry basins, ponds, and lakes. A normally-dry basin is one designed to impound stormwater runoff for only a brief period of time following a storm event. The vast majority of the time the basin will be completely dry except for any normal stream flows which pass through unimpeded. Lakes and ponds, on the other hand, are designed to impound a body of water at least several feet in depth on a more-or-less permanent basis. Lakes and ponds vary from one another only in terms of magnitude. The magnitude of a lake is determined primarily from the height of its dam, the size of its contributing drainage area, and the volume of water it is capable of impounding. For purposes of these regulations, a pond is any lake having a dam height of less than nine feet and which is incapable of impounding more than 20 acre-feet of water. 
                  c.  All dam design is to be certified by a professional engineer currently registered in the State of Georgia. 
                  d.  Dams for normally-dry detention basins shall conform to the following: 
                  (1)  Dams for normally-dry detention basins may be constructed of earth, reinforced concrete, mortared granite rubble, or other suitable materials. 
                  (2)  The design of any concrete or rubble wall over five feet in height shall be certified by a structural engineer currently registered as a professional engineer in the State of Georgia, and the structural design shall be based on soil tests certified by a geotechnical engineer currently registered as a professional engineer in the State of Georgia. 
                  (3)  Any non-earthen structure shall be designed to prevent piping failure through its subgrade and abutments. 
                  (4)  The construction of walls over five feet in height shall be monitored and approved by a qualified materials testing company. 
                  (5)  Earthen dams for normally-dry detention basins shall have a top width of no less than eight feet. 
                  (6)  For earthen dams for normally-dry detention basins, there shall be at least 1½ feet of vertical separation between the 100-year ponding elevation in the basin and the low point on the top of the dam. One foot of this distance is to provide a margin of safety against overtopping of the dam and the other six inches is to allow for settlement. No separation is required for a non-earthen dam, if it has been designed to overtop safely. 
                  (7)  More stringent design and construction criteria shall be used for dams for normally-dry detention basins whenever the probable consequences of dam failure are severe. 
                  e.  Dams for ponds shall conform to the following: 
                  (1)  Any engineer responsible for the design of a dam for a pond is expected to be knowledgeable of the criteria contained within the Georgia Safe Dams Act, Georgia Department of Natural Resources "Rules for Dam Safety" publication, and the U.S.D.A. Soil Conservation Service's Technical Release No. 60 "Earth Dams and Reservoirs." The provisions of each are to be applied wherever applicable. Applicability shall be determined based upon site-specific constraints and downstream conditions. Consultation with appropriate department personnel both prior to and throughout the design process is encouraged. 
                  f.  Dams for lakes shall conform to the following: 
                  (1)  Any engineer responsible for the design of a dam for a lake shall be a professional engineer currently registered in the State of Georgia and is expected to be thoroughly familiar with the criteria contained within the Georgia Safe Dams Act, Georgia Department of Natural Resources "Rules for Dam Safety" publication, and the U.S.D.A. Soil Conservation Service's Technical Release No. 60 "Earth Dams and Reservoirs." All design is to be in accordance with the applicable requirements contained in each of the above referenced publications.

                  9.8.3. - Detention facility outlet devices. 
                  a.  Because of the variables that may be associated with the choice of an outlet device for any given condition, the design consultant is responsible for the selection of the device, subject to the review and approval of the department. 
                  b.  The department will include in its consideration the ease of maintenance, longevity of the system, freedom from congestion, practicality, and aesthetics in its review of the outlet device. The consultant should be guided by the departmental preference of vertical weir designs since they have proven to generally meet most of the considerations expressed herein. 
                  c.  No orifice shall be smaller than three inches in diameter. An orifice smaller than 15 inches in diameter shall be protected by a trash rack. A trash rack protecting an orifice shall have surface area of at least ten square feet. Design shall be in accordance with the Gwinnett County Storm Water Design Manual. No opening in the trash rack shall have an area more than one-half the size of the area of the orifice being protected. Two-stage trash racks, or screens having progressively smaller openings placed in series, are suggested. To facilitate outlet operation, curved or inclined trash racks designed to allow debris to rise with the water level are preferred. In all cases, trash racks shall be either hinged or removable to facilitate maintenance operations. 
                  d.  If the primary detention facility outlet is a conduit through a dam, and there is not an orifice, weir-box, or other flow-control device affixed to the upstream end, then the conduit shall be analyzed for both inlet and outlet control conditions. If an orifice or weir-box is affixed, then the conduit shall be analyzed to determine if any flows will occur for which outlet control conditions in the conduit, rather than the hydraulic characteristics of the flow-control structure, will determine the total flows occurring. In any case where the conduit through the dam is less than 15 inches in diameter, the trash rack provisions of "c" above shall be followed. 
                  e.  Unless the 100-year maximum flow velocity in a conduit through a dam forming a pond or a lake is less than ten feet per second, and the hydraulic grade line for the 100-year condition is at or below the crown of the conduit for at least 90 percent of its length, the conduit must be equal or superior to class V reinforced concrete pipe in its structural characteristics.

                  9.8.4. - Emergency overflow requirements. 
                  a.  For every type of detention facility, a planned safe flowpath must be provided for conveyance of flows of water in excess of those for which the detention facility was designed. In many instances, this function can be provided through installation of an emergency spillway. Emergency spillways are usually excavated open channels, either vegetated or paved with reinforced concrete. 
                  b.  Every earthen dam shall be provided with an open-channel emergency spillway, unless all of the following apply: 
                  (1)  The principal spillway is a closed conduit having a cross-sectional area that can pass 125 percent of the 100-year storm routed peak discharge. 
                  (2)  The principal spillway is a closed conduit having a cross-sectional area of at least one square foot per each three acres of drainage area, or a maximum of twenty square feet of surface area, whichever is less. 
                  (3)  The principal spillway capacity is at least equal to the capacity required for an open-channel emergency spillway. 
                  (4)  The low point of the dam crest is not in a fill section except for roadway embankments. 
                  (5)  A trash rack or other debris protection is provided on the outlet control. 
                  c.  Any portion of any emergency spillway excavated into a dam embankment or other fill section must be paved. Pavement material shall be either reinforced concrete or asphalt, as dictated by the design life of the dam and the potential consequences of its failure. Any portion of any emergency spillway excavated into natural ground shall be vegetated in accordance with the practices described in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia." 
                  d.  In determining the necessary dimensions of an open-channel spillway for a normally-dry basin, a pond, or a lake, the methodology contained in the "Earth Emergency Spillway Design Data" section of the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" should be used. 
                  e.  Emergency spillway capacity for earthen dams shall be as follows: 
                  (1)  For normally-dry detention basins, ponds, and lakes, having a dam height of less than nine feet, and which are incapable of impounding more than 20 acre-feet of water, and for which the probable sequences of dam failure are not severe, an emergency spillway shall be provided. Its capacity shall be at least equal to the difference between the routed 100-year peak flow out of the detention facility assuming the principal spillway is blocked. 
                  (2)  For normally-dry detention basins, ponds, and lakes, having a dam height of nine feet or more and which are capable of impounding 20 acre-feet or more of water, an emergency spillway shall be provided. Its capacity shall be at least equal to the greater of either the routed 100-year peak flowrate out of the facility assuming the principal spillway is blocked, or the routed one-fourth PMF hydrograph out of the facility. In cases when state or federal regulations may require greater spillway capacity, those more stringent regulations shall govern. 
                  f.  Emergency overflow for non-earthen dams may take the form of planned structure overtopping. In such cases, however, care must be taken to prevent flows from eroding supporting soils along the toe of or immediately downstream from the dam so as to cause it to be undermined. The profile of the top of the dam shall be so designed as to prevent flows along the ends of the structure that might result in abutment erosion.

                  9.8.5. - Parking lot detention facilities. 
                  a.  Parking lot detention facilities shall generally be of one of the two following types: 
                  (1)  Depressed areas of pavement at drop inlet locations; and, 
                  (2)  Ponding areas along sections of raised curbing. The curbing in these areas is usually higher than a standard curbed section. 
                  b.  The detention methodology utilized for all parking lot detention facility design shall conform to the Gwinnett County Storm Water Design Manual. 
                  c.  Parking lot detention areas shall be located so as to restrict ponding to areas other than parking spaces near buildings, and to not encroach upon entrance drives. 
                  d.  The maximum depth of detention ponding in a parking lot, except at a flow control structure, shall be six inches for a ten-year storm, and nine inches for a 100-year storm. The maximum depth of ponding at a flow control structure shall be 12 inches for a 100-year storm. 
                  e.  In truck parking areas, the maximum depth of ponding shall be 12 inches for the ten-year storm. 
                  f.  Detention ponding areas are to be drained within 30 minutes after the peak inflow occurs. 
                  g.  Parking lot detention areas shall have a minimum surface slope of one percent, and a maximum slope of five percent.

                  9.8.6. - Underground and rooftop detention facilities. 
                  The design of underground or rooftop detention facilities shall be in accordance with current engineering standard practice, and shall conform to the general spirit and intent of this article. In the case of rooftop detention, permissible structural loads and weatherproofing shall be governed by the Standard Building Code. 
                  (Ord. of 6-28-2004(5)) 
                  9.8.7. - Sediment basins. 
                  a.  Stormwater management and sediment trapping functions should be separated whenever possible. Every erosion control design should seek to: first, prevent erosion from occurring; second, trap sediments as close to their sources as possible, and: third, provide a second-tier or backup line of defense against sediments leaving the project site. This backup defense will usually consist of check dams/and or sediment basins. 
                  b.  Whenever a sediment basin and a detention facility are both required on the same watercourse, the sediment basin should be located immediately upstream of the detention facility. 
                  c.  In unusual cases where a normally-dry detention basin is planned to be used to trap sediment as well as provide stormwater control, the basin may be undercut to accommodate the sediment so that the required detention characteristics, particularly volume, will be maintained.

                  9.9.1. - Culverts. 
                  a.  Single barrel or single cell culvert structures are less prone to clogging and require less maintenance than multi-barrel or multi-cell installations and should therefore be used whenever feasible. 
                  b.  The maximum velocity in an aluminized steel coated pipe culvert for the 100-year flow shall be 15 fps (feet per second). Velocities over ten fps in a pipe of any material shall be considered a special design with particular attention required to pipe or structure invert protection and to fill slope, stream bed, and stream bank stability. 
                  c.  The minimum allowable slope shall be in accordance with the Gwinnett County Storm Water Design Manual.

                  9.9.2. - Pipe collection systems. 
                  a.  The maximum velocity in an aluminized steel coated pipe system for the design flow shall be 15 fps. Velocities over ten fps in a pipe of any material shall be considered a special design with particular attention required to pipe invert protection and the ability of the receiving waterway or detention facility to accept the flow without damage. 
                  b.  The minimum allowable slope shall be in accordance with the Gwinnett County Storm Water Design. 
                  c.  The maximum allowable slope for a concrete storm drainage pipe shall be ten percent, for a corrugated metal pipe shall be 14 percent and for a HDPE pipe shall be 14 percent. Greater slopes may be approved if installation is in accordance with manufacturer's recommendations. In cases where the slope is in excess of ten percent, anchor collars may be required. 
                  d.  A minimum pipe cover of one foot shall be required.

                  9.9.3. - Outlet location—Culverts and pipe systems. 
                  a.  Outlet structures (such as headwalls) shall not be located closer to the project site's property line with an adjoining property than the greater of the distance necessary to construct any velocity protection or a flow distance equal to six pipe diameters. For non-circular conduits, this distance shall be six times the rise dimension of the conduit. 
                  b.  The invert elevation of a culvert or pipe outlet shall be no more than two feet above the elevation of the bottom of the receiving watercourse at the outlet.

                  The maximum developed condition flow velocity at the project site's downstream property line with an adjoining tract shall not exceed the maximum predeveloped condition velocity. Calculations may be required to support this velocity standard on a case-by-case basis. 
                  (Ord. of 6-28-2004(5)) 
                  9.9.5. - Discharge of concentrated flows. 
                  a.  The discharge of concentrated flows of stormwater into public roadways shall be avoided. In no case shall such concentrated flows, including flows from swales, ditches, draws, driveways, or piped systems, exceed the allowable peak flowrates in table 9-H, below. 
                  Table 9-H  Maximum Flows Into Streets 

                   
                  b.  In residential subdivisions, the drainage area contributing to the peak flow along any property line between lots within 50 feet of the building setback line for either lot shall not exceed two acres, unless contained within a piped drainage system or maintained in a natural watercourse. The storm water conveyance shall be in a drainage easement.

                  ARTICLE 11. - PROCEDURES 

                  11.1. - SUBDIVISION REVIEW PROCEDURES. 
                  11.1.1. - Pre-application conference. 
                  Whenever any subdivision of a tract of land is proposed to be made, whether for residential or nonresidential development, the subdivider is encouraged to present to the department preliminary documents and graphic exhibits to permit early evaluation of the subdivider's intentions and coordination with the comprehensive plan, zoning ordinance [appendix B of this volume], etc., and to inform and provide the subdivider with the necessary regulations in order to properly accomplish the proposed project. 
                  11.1.2. - Concept plan approval. 
                  a.  Application for concept plan approval shall be submitted to the department using an application form and in a number of copies to be determined by the director of planning and development or his/her designee. The concept plan shall include the entire property proposed for development, but need not include the applicant's entire contiguous ownership. 
                  b.  In such case that the subdivider elects not to submit a concept plan, then the subdivider may proceed directly with the submittal of development plans (called a preliminary plat) if they show the entire property proposed for development. In so doing, however, the subdivider assumes the risk of premature design and engineering expenses in the event that the city requires subsequent design and engineering changes. 
                  c.  Copies of the approved concept plan shall be provided to the department for permanent record, in a number as determined by the director of planning and development or his/her designee.

                  11.1.3. - Development plans approval for subdivisions. 
                  a.  An application for development plans (called a preliminary plat) approval and issuance of a development permit shall be submitted to the department using an application form and in a number of copies as determined by the director of planning and development or his/her designee. The development plans may encompass a portion of a property included within an approved concept plan. However, if no concept plan has been approved, the development plans must include the entire property being developed and having the same zoning. The application shall include the preliminary plat, and construction drawings. All construction drawings and other engineering data shall be prepared and sealed by a professional engineer currently registered in the State of Georgia, in accordance with provisions of Georgia Law. 
                  b.  The director shall indicate on a review copy of the drawings or in a written memorandum all comments related to compliance of the development plans with these regulations, principles of good design, the zoning ordinance [appendix B of this volume], conditions of zoning approval, and the regulations of other city and county departments and state agencies as appropriate. The director shall have final staff authority to determine the applicability of any and all comments under these development regulations, the zoning ordinance or conditions of zoning approval. 
                  c.  A preliminary plat may not be approved whereon is shown a lot which would present particularly unusual difficulties for construction of a building, which would clearly require a variance to be reasonably usable, or which is otherwise "unbuildable" because of its unusability, whether due to the presence of floodplain, unusual configuration, lack of public utilities or for any other reason. A House Location Plan (HLP) may be required to be filed as a part of the preliminary plat approval to substantiate the buildability of any such difficult or unusual lot. 
                  d.  The subdivider shall be responsible for compliance with all codes, regulations, and zoning requirements and for the satisfaction of all of the noted and written comments of the director of planning and development or his/her designee. 
                  e.  Should an applicant disagree with the findings or final review comments of the director of planning and development or his/her designee or of any other city department, concluding that factual or interpretive errors have been made, the following appeal procedure shall be followed to resolve the issues. 
                  (1)  Submit to the department of planning and development a written statement clearly defining the nature of the disagreement, the specific reference to the sections of the regulations (i.e., sewer regulations, development regulations, etc.) at issue, and the applicant's own opinion. 
                  (2)  Should the department under appeal fail to respond within ten working days from the date of transmittal of the appeal by the department of planning and development, the department shall automatically forward a copy of the appeal to the board of appeals for final action in their normal course of business. 
                  f.  When the director of planning and development or his/her designee has determined that the plat and other development plans are in compliance with all applicable city regulations and zoning requirements and approval has been received from all affected city and county departments, he shall sign and date a CERTIFICATE OF DEVELOPMENT PLANS APPROVAL stamped or printed on a reproducible copy of the plat. Copies of approved plat and development plans shall be transmitted to the applicant and retained by the department for its records. 
                  g.  Following the above approval by all affected city and county departments, a development permit shall be issued at the developer's request to begin construction activities based on the approved development plans.

                  11.1.4. - Final plat approval. 
                  a.  When the provisions of these regulations have been complied with, the subdivider may submit to the department an application for final plat approval, using an application form and a number of copies as determined by the director of planning and development or his/her designee. 
                  b.  The director of planning and development or his/her designee shall indicate on a review copy of the plat or in a written memorandum all comments related to compliance of the final plat with these regulations, the zoning ordinance [appendix B of this volume], conditions of zoning approval, and the regulations of other city and county departments and state agencies as appropriate. The director of planning and development or his/her designee shall have final staff authority to determine the applicability of any and all comments under these development regulations, the zoning ordinance or conditions of zoning approval. 
                  c.  A final plat may not be approved whereon is shown or by which is otherwise created a lot which would present particularly severe and unusual difficulties for construction of a building, which would clearly require a variance to be reasonably usable, or which is otherwise "unbuildable" due to the presence of floodplain, unusual configuration, lack of Gwinnett County Health Department approval, or for any other justified reason. 
                  d.  Lots which would appear to be buildable under certain circumstances and would require further study or additional information before a building permit could be issued, but which present problems or unusual difficulties which can reasonably be addressed or overcome by the lot owner, may be included in the plat with the appropriate notation of the steps necessary to allow issuance of a building permit (see section 5.9 [5.5], lots, of the general design standards). 
                  e.  The subdivider shall be responsible for compliance with all codes, regulations, and zoning requirements and for the satisfaction of all of the comments of the director of planning and development or his/her designee. 
                  f.  Final approval by the director of planning and development or his/her designee shall not be shown on the final plat until all requirements of these and other applicable regulations have been met, and the director of planning and development or his/her designee has received a completed request for approval of development conformance and an executed development performance and maintenance agreement. The agreement shall be accompanied by a bond, letter of credit or other acceptable surety providing for the maintenance of all installations and improvements required by these regulations in the subdivision for a period not to exceed 12 months following the date of approval of development conformance for subdivisions for which the final topping of a "two-pass" street has not been applied or for a period not to exceed 24 months. The maintenance bond period of application may be extended by the director of planning and development or his/her designee at the request of the developer, provided it is in the best interest of the health, safety and welfare of the public. 
                  g.  The director of planning and development or his/her designee shall further determine that either: 
                  (1)  All improvements and installation to the subdivision required for approval of the final plat under the rules and regulations of the City of Snellville have been completed in accordance with the appropriate specifications; or 
                  (2)  All of the stormwater drainage and detention facilities, water and sewer utilities, street base and curbing construction required for approval of the final plat have been properly installed and completed and, for those required improvements not yet completed (grassing, pavement topping, required landscaping, sidewalks, etc.) a performance bond shall have been filed by the subdivider with the development performance and maintenance agreement, which performance bond shall: 
                  (a)  Be conditioned upon the faithful performance by the subdivider or developer of all work required to complete all improvements and installations for the subdivision, or approved portion thereof, in compliance with these rules and regulations within a specified time, not to exceed three months; 
                  (b)  Be payable to, and for the indemnification of, the city;

                  Section 3.4. - Rules for interpretation of district boundaries. 
                  Where uncertainty exists with respect to the location of the boundaries of any zoning district in Snellville, Georgia, the following rules shall apply: 
                  1.  Where a zoning district boundary line is shown as approximately following a corporate limits line, a militia district line, a land lot line, a lot line or the centerline of a street, a county road, a state highway, an interstate highway, or a railroad right-of-way or such lines extended, then such lines shall be construed to be the zoning district boundary lines. 
                  2.  Where a zoning district boundary line is shown as being set back from a street, a county road, a state highway, an interstate highway or a railroad right-of-way, and approximately parallel thereto, then such zoning district boundary line shall be construed as being at the scaled distance from the centerline of the street, county road, state highway, interstate highway or railroad right-of-way and as being parallel thereto. 
                  3.  Where a zoning district boundary line divides a lot, the location of the line shall be the scaled distance from the lot lines. In this situation, the requirements of the zoning district in which the greater portion of the lot lies shall apply to the balance of the lot except that such extension shall not include any part of a lot that lies more than 50 feet beyond the zoning district boundary line. 
                  4.  In the case of a through lot fronting on two approximately parallel streets that is divided by a zoning district boundary line paralleling the streets, the restrictions of the zoning district in which each frontage of the through lot lies shall apply to that portion of the through lot. 
                  5.  Where zoning district boundaries are in doubt, the Snellville Planning Commission shall make such interpretation using the appropriate scale from the official zoning map. 
                  Section 3.5. - Districts listed. 
                  For the purposes of this ordinance the incorporated area of Snellville, Georgia is divided into zoning districts designated as follows:

The mayor and council in determining the zoning classification may take into account the use restrictions on the land prior to annexation and shall take into account the city's land use plan. 
                  Section 3.7. - Zoning lots to be designated. 
                  To facilitate the enforcement of this ordinance the device of zoning lots as defined herein shall be used. A parcel of land shall be designated and suitably recorded by the building inspector as forming the site of each new building, structure or use of land or the site of any building structure or use of land designated for any alteration or modification requiring a building permit or certificate of occupancy. Said parcel shall conform in dimensions and area to provisions of this ordinance. A zoning lot may or may not coincide with platted lot lines. Each zoning lot shall front on a public street of not less than 25 feet in width for a distance of not less than 25 feet or shall have an exclusive, unobstructed, permanent access to such a public street. 
                  ARTICLE IV. - APPLICATION OF DISTRICT REGULATIONS

                  No building, structure, land or open space shall hereafter be used or occupied, and no building or structure, or part thereof, shall hereafter be erected, constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered unless in conformity with all of the regulations herein specified for the district in which it is located. 
                  Section 4.2. - Height and density. 
                  No building or other structure shall hereafter be erected or altered: 
                  1.  To exceed the height or bulk limits of this ordinance;

                  3.  To occupy a greater percentage of lot area; 
                  4.  To have narrower or smaller rear yards, front yards, side yards, or other open spaces than herein required; 
                  or in any other manner contrary to the provisions of this ordinance. 
                  Section 4.3. - Lot size and occupancy. 
                  No lot, even though it may consist of one or more adjacent lots in the same ownership at the time of passage of this ordinance, shall be reduced in size so that lot width or size of yards of lot area per family or any other requirements of this ordinance are not maintained.

                  ARTICLE V. - NONCONFORMING USES 
                  Within the zoning districts established by this ordinance or amendments that may later be adopted, there exist: 

                   
                  which were lawful before this ordinance was passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this ordinance or future amendments. It is the intent of this ordinance to permit these nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival. It is further the intent of this ordinance that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district. 
                  Nonconforming uses are declared by this ordinance to be incompatible with permitted uses in the districts involved. A nonconforming use of a structure, a nonconforming use of land, or a nonconforming use of structure and land in combination shall not be extended or enlarged after passage of this ordinance. 
                  To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this ordinance shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction, or designated use of any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption of this ordinance. Actual construction is hereby defined to include the placing of construction materials in permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner. Where excavation or demolition or removal of an existing building has been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding, such excavation or demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction. 

                  Section 5.1. - Nonconforming lots of record. 
                  In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, a single-family dwelling and customary accessory building may be erected on any single lot of record at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this ordinance. Such lot must be in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership. This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, that are generally applicable in the district, provided that yard dimensions and requirements other than these applying to area or width, or both, of the lots shall conform to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located. Variance of yard requirements shall be obtained only through action of the board of appeals. 
                  If two or more lots or combinations of lots and portions of lots with continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at the time of passage or amendment of this ordinance, and if all or part of the lots do not meet the requirements established for lot width and area, the lands involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the purposes of this ordinance, and no portion of said parcel shall be used or sold in a manner which diminishes compliance with lot width and area requirements established by this ordinance, nor shall any division of any parcel be made which creates a lot with width or area below the requirements stated in this ordinance. 
                  Section 5.2. - Nonconforming uses of land (or land with minor structures only). 
                  Where at the time of passage of this ordinance lawful use of land exists which would not be permitted by the regulations imposed by this ordinance, and where such use involves no individual structure with a replacement cost exceeding $1,000, the use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, provided: 
                  1.  No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance; 
                  2.  No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such use at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance; 
                  3.  If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a period of more than 30 days, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the regulations specified by this ordinance for the district in which such land is located; 
                  4.  No additional structure not conforming to the requirements of this ordinance shall be erected in connection with such nonconforming use of land. 
                  Section 5.3. - Nonconforming structures. 
                  Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance that could not be built under the terns [terms] of this ordinance that restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, its location on the lot, or other requirements concerning the structure, such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
                  1.  No such nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be altered to decrease its nonconformity; 
                  2.  Should such nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of more than 75 percent of its replacement cost at time of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance; and 
                  3.  Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located after it is moved. 
                  (ZOA 2010-01, § 1, 3-22-2010) 
                  Section 5.4. - Nonconforming uses of structures or of structures and premises in combination. 
                  If lawful use involving individual structures with a replacement cost of $1,000.00 or more, or of structure and premises in combination, exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
                  1.  No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this ordinance in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered except in changing the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located; 
                  2.  Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption or amendment of this ordinance, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building; 
                  3.  If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises, may as a special exception be changed to another nonconforming use provided that the board of appeals, either by general rule or by making findings in the specific case, shall find that the proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the existing nonconforming use. In permitting such change, the board of appeals may require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accord with the provisions of this ordinance; 
                  4.  Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed; 
                  5.  When a nonconforming use of structure, or structure and premises in combination, is discontinued or abandoned for 18 consecutive months or for 36 months during any five-year period (except when government action impedes access to the premises), the structure, or structure and premises in combination, shall not thereafter be used except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located. The nonconformity of the structure and premises shall be calculated from the date of adoption of this amended section of this ordinance. However, the property owner must submit a written request to the director of planning and development with required fees for review and approval. The director of planning and development may approve use of nonconforming structure and premises up to two years with a one-time extension for an additional 12 months. Substantial variation from the conformity as determined by the director of planning and development will require mayor and council approval. The approval of nonconforming structure does not automatically approve nonconforming sign(s). The director of planning and development cannot approve nonconforming signs on nonconforming structures and premises; 
                  6.  Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and premises in combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the nonconforming status of the land. Destruction for the purpose of this subsection is defined as damage to an extent of more than 75 percent of the replacement cost at the time of destruction. 
                  (ZOA 2010-01, §§ 2, 3, 3-22-2010) 
                  Section 5.5. - Repairs and maintenance. 
                  On any nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a nonconforming use, work may be done in any period of 12 consecutive months on ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing, to an extent not exceeding ten percent of the current replacement cost of the nonconforming portion of the structure, as the case may be, provided that the cubic content existing when it became nonconforming shall not be increased. 
                  If a nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a nonconforming use becomes physically unsafe or unlawful due to lack of repairs and maintenance, and is declared by any duly authorized official to be unlawful by reason of physical condition, it shall not thereafter be restored, repaired, or rebuilt except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located. Nothing in this ordinance shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of such official. 
                  Section 5.6. - Uses under special exception provisions not nonconforming uses. 
                  Any use which is permitted as a special exception in a district under the terms of this ordinance (other than a change through board of appeals' action from a nonconforming use to another use not generally permitted in the district) shall not be deemed a nonconforming use in such district, but shall without further action be considered a conforming use. 
                  Section 5.7. - Amortization and discontinuance. 
                  There are found to be certain uses of land, buildings and structures which have an adverse effect on the carrying out of the comprehensive plan and which can reasonably be discontinued after a reasonable time irrespective of aforementioned rules as to nonconforming uses. The following uses shall be removed or made conforming within the specified amortization period. Said amortization period shall commence upon the effective date of this ordinance. 
                  1.  Fences, walls and foliage which constitute a hazard by virtue of impairing sight distances at a curve or intersection shall be made conforming within 90 days. 
                  2.  Outdoor advertising signs and billboards deemed a nuisance or hazard shall conform within eight years. 
                  3.  All provisions in business or industrial districts of this ordinance setting forth specifications for the operation of a business or industry requiring fencing or opaque shielding shall be complied with within one calendar year. 
                  4.  Nonconforming open storage operations, such as truck parking, automobile wrecking or salvage material storage and similar uses shall be made conforming within two calendar years. 
                  5.  Nonconforming frame, block or light metal structures shall be made conforming within 25 calendar years. 
                  6.  All other nonconforming structures shall be made conforming within 40 calendar years. 
                  7.  Structures incurring damage of less than 50 percent of fair market value above the foundation may be restored, reconstructed and used as before, provided that such restoration is commenced within six calendar months from the date damages were incurred. If reconstruction is not commenced within six months, the use of said land or structure shall thereafter conform with the provisions of this ordinance. Fair market value shall be determined by reference to current statutory provisions pertaining to real estate assessment and the records of the county assessor. 
                  Section 5.8. - Lots of record. 
                  All lots or parcels of record as of the effective date of this amendment and all lots or parcels which have been submitted by way of preliminary plat and approved by the department in accord[ance] with the provisions of the Snellville Zoning Ordinance of 2001, as of the effective date of this amendment, that are made unbuildable by the stream buffer and setback provisions may still be developed on a case-by-case basis. Requests for development of these lots shall be made to the mayor and council. If development is allowed, the maximum possible impervious surface setback and stream buffer width, given the configuration of the lot, shall be maintained.

                  (1)  The special use would be consistent with the needs of the neighborhood or the community as a whole, be compatible with the neighborhood and would not be in conflict with the overall objectives of the comprehensive plan; and 
                  (2)  A special use listed under the zoning district is desired for development and a more intensive zoning district which contains that use as a use by right would not be appropriate for the property; or 
                  (3)  A special use listed under the relevant subsection is desired for development and no zoning district contains that use as a use by right; or

                  (5)  The density of development may be affected by the height of a building. 
                  In order to accommodate these special uses, the special use permit allows the mayor and council to approve a special use on a particular lot without changing the general zoning district. Such approval shall be subject to the requirements set forth below and any additional conditions the mayor and city council and/or the planning commission deems necessary to ensure the compatibility of the special use with the surrounding properties. All special use permit applications shall be for firm development proposals only. The special use permit shall not be used for securing early zoning for conceptual proposals which may not be undertaken for more than six months from the date the application is submitted. A special use permit application shall be considered only if it is made by the owner of the property or his/her authorized agent. 
                  The minimum requirements for a special use permit are: 
                  a.  Any uses permitted under a special use permit shall conform to the requirements of this ordinance and the development and zoning regulations for the use as found in the zoning district.

In the review process, particular emphasis shall be given to evaluating the relationship of and the compatibility with the proposed use to its immediate neighborhood. 
                  c.  In the approval process for a special use permit application, the mayor and city council shall consider the policies and objectives of the comprehensive plan, particularly in relationship to the proposed site and surrounding area, and shall consider the potential adverse impacts on the surrounding area, especially with regard to but not limited to traffic, storm drainage, land values and compatibility of land use activities. 
                  d.  If an application is approved and a special use permit is granted, all conditions which may have been attached to the approval are binding on the property. All subsequent development and use of the property shall be in accordance with the approved plan and conditions. All final site plans shall be approved by the planning and development department prior to the issuance of any permits. Once established, the special use shall be in continuous operation. Upon discovery that the operation of the special use has or had ceased for a period of 180 days or more and the owner of the property has not requested voluntary termination of the special use permit, the director of planning and development shall forward a report to the mayor and council through the planning commission which may recommend that action be taken to remove the special use permit from the property. 
                  e.  Changes to a special use or development of a site for the special use shall be treated as an amendment to the special use permit and shall be subject to the same application and review process as a new application. 
                  f.  The special use for which a special use permit is granted shall commence operations or construction within 12 months of the date of approval by the mayor and council. If, at the end of this 12-month period, the director determines that active efforts are not proceeding toward operation or construction, a report may be forwarded to the mayor and council through the planning commission which may recommend that action be taken to remove the special use permit from the property. 
                  g.  The director of planning and development or his designee or an officer of the City of Snellville Police Department shall have the right to periodically examine the operation of the specific use to determine compliance with the requirements of any conditions. If the director determines that the requirements and conditions are being violated, a written notice shall be issued to the owner of the property outlining the nature of the violations and giving the owner of the property a maximum of 30 days to come into compliance. This 30-day maximum shall be amendable in the reasonable discretion of the director of planning and zoning. If after 30 days the violations continue to exist, the director shall forward a report to the mayor and council through the planning commission, which may recommend that action be taken to remove the special use permit from the property. 
                  h.  Upon approval by the mayor and council, a special use permit shall be identified on the official zoning maps. 
                  i.  Upon approval by the mayor and council of a special use permit, the owner of the property shall be issued a notice from the director, which states the specific use permitted, the requirements of this section and any conditions attached to the approval. 
                  j.  The planning and development department shall not issue a certificate of occupancy for the specific use unless all requirements and conditions of the special use permit have been fulfilled by the owner of the property.

                  Section 7.7. - Architectural design standards. 
                  Objectives and findings: In an effort to maintain high quality, long-lasting and sustainable development within the City of Snellville, the city hereby adopts the following design guidelines and standards for all newly constructed buildings within nonresidential, multifamily, residential conditional use districts. These guidelines are intended to enhance the visual aspect and livability of the entire city. These guidelines will foster architectural diversity and interest, yet achieve and maintain a consistent, durable and pleasing aesthetic/visual quality. 
                  The use of a common palate of building materials should be maintained for all building facades to create a consistent and traditional architectural identity. Traditional architecture includes the use of red brick, pitched roofs, low-profile signage and subdued colors. For large commercial/retail buildings, variations in facade, roofline and depth should be provided to lend the appearance of multi-tenant occupancy. 
                  1.  Building plans: All building plans submitted as an application for a building permit should clearly indicate all of the proposed building materials and colors for each facade as described herein. The plans should clearly show the location and calculate the amount/percentages of all building materials per facade. 
                  Groups of buildings on the same parcel of land may be reviewed and permitted as a single project rather than individual buildings. Grouping of similar buildings is encouraged to minimize the number of reviews required and to allow for originality and design flexibility. 
                  The following design standards are primarily based upon the city's zoning categories. However if a use is clearly permitted in a less intensive zoning district, building material allocations shall be used for the less intensive classification (e.g. a professional office in a BG zoning district shall use the building material allocations in Table I for OP categories.) 
                  2.  Definitions: 
                  Arcade: As used herein, an arcade is a covered walkway/structural canopy extending along the entire length of the front facade of a commercial building. 
                  Building: Any structure having a roof supported by walls and intended for the shelter, housing or enclosure of any individual, process, equipment, goods or materials of any kind. 
                  Facade: A vertical exterior face or elevation of a building. 
                  Front facade: Any facade with a public entry which faces a public right-of-way. 
                  Rear facade: Any facade without a public entry that does not face a public right-of-way. 
                  Side facade: Any facade without a public entry but facing a public right-of-way or any facade with a public entry but not facing a public right-of-way. A side facade typically connects a front facade with a rear facade. 
                  3.  General architectural requirements: 
                  A.  If provided, dumpsters shall be screened to a height of eight feet with an opaque screen on three sides made of brick, stucco, or split-face block and located behind the building they serve. For industrial/distribution/warehouse buildings exceeding 25,000 square feet, no screening is required. However, the dumpsters shall be located in the rear yard behind the building they serve. 
                  B.  All ground mounted mechanical, HVAC and like systems shall be screened from public street view (within 300 feet) by an opaque wall or fence made of brick, stucco, split face block or landscaping. 
                  C.  For all commercial/retail buildings, roof-mounted mechanical, HVAC and like systems shall be screened from public street view (within 300 feet) on all sides. 
                  D.  Contrasting accent colors on any single facade shall be limited to no more than ten percent of the total wall area for any single facade. Said colors shall be selected from appendix VII-A, Exterior Color Palette. No more than three different colors shall be used on any project. 
                  E.  Permanent mounted exterior neon lights shall not be allowed. 
                  F.  In a nonresidential development with out-parcels, buildings located on outparcels shall be constructed of the same primary building material as the principal building with which they are associated. 
                  G.  Back-lit awnings, roof-mounted lights, and/or roof-mounted flag poles are not permitted. Satellite dishes shall be located and painted to blend with the background as much as practical. 
                  4.  Building materials: The following building materials may be used and combined to create a consistent, attractive, interesting and long-lasting building design. The quantity and type of building materials is outlined below. 
                  A.  Allowed building materials: 
                  1.  Brick—Brick veneers which are intended to simulate brick exteriors are not acceptable. Painted brick is not acceptable; 
                  2.  Stone—Natural stone such as, but not limited to, granite, limestone, and marble are allowed building materials. Terra cotta and/or cast stone, which simulate natural stone, are also acceptable. Painted stone is not allowed; 
                  3.  Split-face block/concrete masonry unit (CMU); 
                  4.  Tilt/architectural pre-cast concrete; 
                  5.  High grade stucco; 
                  6.  Natural wood and/or cement-based artificial wood siding; 
                  7.  Masonry hardi-plank shakes/shingles; 
                  8.  Glass; 
                  9.  Painted concrete block. 
                  B.  Ratios and amounts of allowed building materials: See Tables I and II on the following pages concerning allowed building materials for uses within each zoning category within the City of Snellville: 
                  C.  Accent/trim exterior building material: Small amounts of building materials such as wood, tile, etc., may be used to enhance the elevation of the building or for decorative elements but should not exceed ten percent of total wall area per facade. Colors of said materials shall comply with subsection 7.7(3)(D). 
                  D.  Facade calculations: With the exception of accent/trim materials, there shall be no more than two primary building materials used. When a material is restricted as a percentage in Table I or table II, such as stucco, siding, etc., the building material may not be combined with another restricted building material. The allowed facade materials shall not apply to windows, glass-front windows, entry doors and/or roll-up doors. 
                  The amount of permitted material shall be calculated using the gross square footage of wall area per facade. A building material that is allowed (such as brick) may be used in any percentage throughout the structure. A material that is restricted (such as stucco) is allowed as a maximum percentage. 
                  For example, a building has a front facade with a gross facade area of 1,200 square feet with 400 square feet consisting of windows and doors. Begin with 1,200 square feet for required building material calculations. In this case, the front facade of a building in BG zoning district with a wall area of 1,200 square feet shall have no more than 300 square feet of stucco on the front facade [ex. (1,200 × 25% = 300)]. The balance shall be brick or other allowed material. 
                  5.  Roof requirements: 
                  A.  Pitched roofs: All one-story buildings less than 10,000 gross square feet must have a pitched roof (between 5:12 and 12:12) as much as possible. If a pitched roof is not possible, a combination of flat roof and pitched roof is required. Provide a pitched roof on front and side of the building to screen view of any flat roof. Create arcades, drive-under canopies, porches and other features with pitched roof. 
                  Materials for pitched roofs shall be limited to architectural dimensional grade asphalt shingles, natural slate, natural terra cotta, natural wood shake, copper or factory finished sheet metal. 
                  B.  Mansard roofs: Mansard roofs shall have a maximum pitch of 12:12 with a minimum 12 foot vertical surface length. 
                  C.  Flat roofs: Flat roofs may be of any material that meet building codes. Exposed metal flashing shall be copper or factory finished sheet metal. If factory finished metal flashing is used, such as standing seam, the color must be subdued to blend with other materials or of a color to simulate weathered copper or bronze. 
                  All buildings with flat roofs should include parapet articulation on the front facade(s) of such building. There shall be roof articulations/offsets at a minimum of one per each 125 linear feet of length by a change in the top line of the parapet. Additional articulation may occur at any lesser distance. If the front facade is less than 125 linear feet, then a minimum of one roof articulation must occur. 
                  D.  Other: Drive under canopies for gasoline pumps may have flat roof with vertical or factory formed facing of finished sheet metal. 
                  6.  Arcade/structural canopy for retail use: For any multi-tenant commercial shopping center or strip center, a covered arcade/structural canopy shall be provided along the front facade of the building. Arcades are covered walkways connected to or separate from the principal building. They should be designed in a manner which provides architectural depth to the building and includes covered areas for relief from the weather. The arcade should be a minimum of five feet in width. 
                  7.  Alternate review: This ordinance is intended to be followed as outlined above. In the event the intent of this ordinance can be achieved with minor deviations which do not substantially impact the goals or intent of this ordinance, the City of Snellville Planning and Development Department has the authority to modify the specific provisions. 
                  8.  Separability: Any requirement set forth herein deemed unconstitutional, vague, illegal and/or otherwise unenforceable in a court of law shall not invalidate the subject ordinance and all other provisions and requirements thereto shall remain in full force and effect.

                  ARTICLE VIII. - EXCEPTIONS, MODIFICATIONS AND ENCROACHMENTS 

                  Section 8.1. - Height exceptions, general rule. 
                  Any structure hereafter erected or altered shall comply with the height limitations of the district in which it is located except as specified below. 
                  Section 8.2. - Structures excluded from height limitations. 
                  The height limitations of this ordinance shall not apply to church spires, belfries, flag poles, monuments, cupolas, domes, ornamental towers, nor to observation towers not intended for human occupancy, water towers, transmission towers, radio or television towers or aerials. These exceptions shall not apply in the vicinity of airports. 
                  Section 8.3. - Walls and fences. 
                  The setback requirements of this ordinance shall not prohibit any necessary retaining wall or fence except that in a residential district: 
                  1)  Front yard fences and walls shall not exceed four feet in height and shall not extend into public right-of-way. 
                  2)  Front yard fences shall not be made of wire, woven metal, or chainlink unless located on property of an agricultural/undeveloped use or of a size larger than three acres. 
                  3)  Ornamental or decorative fences constructed of brick, stone, stucco, split rail, wood or wrought iron and not constructed of exposed block, tires, junk or other discarded material shall be permitted within the minimum front yard. 
                  4)  No fence shall exceed eight feet in height within a rear or side yard. 
                  Section 8.4. - Yard space, general rule. 
                  Any building, structure or use hereafter erected, altered or established shall comply with the yard space requirements of the district in which it is located except as specified below. The required yard space for any building, structure, or use shall be contained on the same zoning lot as the building, structure or use and such required yard space shall fall entirely upon land in a district or districts in which the principal use is permitted. 
                  Section 8.5. - [Reserved.] 
                  Section 8.6. - Lot area exception, existing platting. 
                  A single-family dwelling may be built on any platted lot of record containing 75 percent of the required lot area for the district in which the lot is located if said lot was in separate ownership and separate control at the effective date of this ordinance, provided the front, side and rear yard requirements for the district in which the lot is located are met and provided dwellings are permitted in the district in which the lot of record is located. It is not the intention of this exception to allow building as a matter of right on a platted parcel which was never intended as a building site, but rather was numbered on a plat for identification purposes under a scheme in which multiple lots were intended to provide one building site. 
                  In the case of such a lot, when it is not possible to provide the required side yards and at the same time build a minimum width one-family dwelling, the zoning board of appeals is hereby authorized to grant a variance reducing the side yard requirements for such lot the minimum amount necessary for a reasonable dwelling, but in no case shall each of the side yards be less than five feet in width. 
                  If two or more lots or combinations of lots and portions of lots with continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at the time of passage or amendment of this ordinance, and if all or part of the lots do not meet the requirements established for lot width and area, the lands involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the purpose of this ordinance, and no portion of said parcel shall be used or sold in a manner which diminishes compliance with lot width and area requirements established by this ordinance, nor shall any division of any parcel be made which creates a lot with width or area below the requirements stated in this ordinance. 
                  Section 8.7. - Temporary buildings and signs. 
                  A temporary building, sign or buildings for use in connection with a construction project or subdivision development shall be permitted on the land on which the project is being constructed during the duration of the construction period. Temporary buildings related to a subdivision development shall be removed when 100 percent of all lots are occupied. In the event that no activity occurs at the construction site within a consecutive three-month period, all buildings and signs shall be removed. All such buildings and signs shall secure an annual permit. The city shall hold the certificate of occupancy for the last structure until all temporary buildings and signs are removed. Temporary signs shall be removed immediately when all lots are occupied by completed homes. 
                  Section 8.8. - Fences and hedges, corner visibility. 
                  Except in districts allowing the construction of buildings or structures to the property line, there shall be provided an unobstructed view across the triangle formed by joining points measured 20 feet distant along the property line from the intersection of two streets or 15 feet along both the street and alley line from the intersection of a street and an alley. Within said triangle there shall be no sight obscuring wall, fence or foliage higher than 30 inches above grade, or in the case of trees, foliage lower than eight feet. Vertical measurement shall be made at the top of the curb on the street or alley adjacent to the nearest side of the triangle or if no curb exists, from the edge of the nearest traveled way. 
                  Section 8.9. - Fences and hedges, measurement rule. 
                  Heights of fences, hedges and other continuous foliage shall be measured from the adjacent top of the street curb, surface of an alley or the official established grade thereof, whichever is the higher. On inside lot lines the measurement shall be from the average grade of the lot line of the parcel or property having the lower elevation. 
                  Section 8.10. - Fences and hedges, exception, board of appeals. 
                  The board of appeals may approve, or may direct as a condition for granting approval, that fences or plantings of a height in excess of these regulations be placed as shieldings between different uses, or between like uses upon agreement between the parties affected thereby, provided that no such approval shall have the effect of reducing corner visibility as provided for herein. 
                  Section 8.11. - [Reserved.] 
                  Section 8.12. - Structures to have access. 
                  Every building hereafter erected or moved shall be on a lot adjacent to a public street, or with access to an approved private street, and all structures shall be so located on lots as to provide safe and convenient access for servicing, fire protection, and required off-street parking. 
                  Section 8.13. - Parking, storage, or use of major recreational equipment. 
                  For purposes of these regulations, major recreational equipment is defined as including boats and boat trailers, travel trailers, pickup campers or coaches (designed to be mounted on automotive vehicles), motorized dwellings, tent trailers, and the like, and cases or boxes used for transporting recreational equipment, whether occupied by such equipment or not. Such major recreational equipment may be parked or stored in side yards or rear yards or in a carport or enclosed buildings, provided, however, that such equipment may be parked anywhere on residential premises for a period not to exceed 24 hours during loading or unloading. In the case of a corner lot, no vehicles may be parked or stored in the side yard on the street side of the lot. No such equipment shall be used for living, sleeping, or housekeeping purposes when parked or stored on a residential lot, or in any location not approved for such use. 
                  Section 8.14. - Parking and storage of certain vehicles. 
                  In all residential districts the parking of any vehicle larger than a van or pickup truck (other than recreational vehicles) is prohibited except when the following provisions apply: 
                  1)  Such vehicle may park within a fully enclosed structure that meets all other criteria of the zoning district. 
                  2)  Such vehicle may park on the side or to the rear of the primary residential structure on the lot provided that the lot is five acres or larger, but in no case may be closer than 100 feet from any property line. 
                  Cross reference— Traffic and vehicles, ch. 58. 
                  Section 8.15. - Multiwheeled vehicles and buses. 
                  Automotive vehicles having more than four wheels, major recreational equipment, school, and other buses are prohibited from parking on residential streets or within public rights-of-way. 
                  Section 8.16. - Canopies for commercial or industrial use. 
                  When a canopy is utilized in connection with a commercial or industrial use in districts where such uses are permitted, such canopy may occupy a portion of the required yard setback adjacent to streets, subject to the following provisions: 
                  1.  No portion of a canopy shall be closer than ten feet from any street right-of-way line when measured vertically, nor closer than 20 feet from the face of the curb of the street. 
                  2.  No canopy shall occupy more than 50 percent of a required yard over which it extends. 
                  3.  Any canopy shall be completely unenclosed. 
                  Section 8.17. - Subdivision, commercial and public recreation facility exceptions. 
                  [(a)]  Setback requirements. 
                  [(1)]  Front yard: 25 feet. 
                  [(2)]  Rear yard: Ten feet. 
                  [(3)]  Side yard: Ten feet. 
                  [(4)]  Side yard on street side corner: 15 feet. 
                  [(b)]  Parking requirements. 
                  [(1)]  Subdivision recreation facility—One space per ten dwelling units. 
                  [(2)]  Commercial and public recreation facility—A minimum of 20 spaces except that golf courses shall require 20 spaces per each nine holes. 
                  [(c)]  Fence requirements. Subdivision, commercial and public recreation facilities shall be exempt from the requirements of section 8.3 [of this article]. 
                  Section 8.18. - Improvements required. 
                  Subdivisions and commercial developments shall be required to construct sidewalks along the right-of-way. Commercial property owners which submit site plans for planning department review, and/or receive a commercial zoning change shall be required to construct sidewalks and curb and gutter along the right-of-way; this shall include conditional uses permitted in all residential districts.

The provisions of this ordinance [section] shall apply to residential development within the following districts established in the City of Snellville Zoning Ordinance, as of the effective date of this ordinance: RS-180 and RS-150 (single family residential districts). The use of the conservation subdivision overlay district regulations is not by right and shall be considered a rezoning; said action shall comply with article 15 of the zoning ordinance. 
                  Any conditions of zoning or special use approval of the underlying district and/or parcel shall also be observed (exception: lot area, width or quantity). The applicant shall comply with all other provisions of the zoning code and all other applicable laws. Whenever the requirements of the CSO district impose a more or less restrictive standard than the provisions of the underlying zoning district stated elsewhere in the zoning ordinance, the requirements of the overlay district shall govern. The director of planning and development shall have the authority to approve alternate methods of compliance with the provisions of this ordinance [section] when he/she determines the overall intent of the article and/or specific guidelines can be met. 
                  For properties which are submitted for rezoning, the applicant shall declare the intent to utilize this overlay district at the time of application. An existing features site analysis plan and a concept plan meeting the requirements of this ordinance [section] shall accompany the rezoning application. In the absence of a declaration of intent to use the overlay district with a rezoning application, the overlay district shall not be used on rezoned property for at least two years from the date of the resolution adopting a zoning change or until a new application is filed in compliance with article 15 of the zoning ordinance and the property rezoned for use with the regulations of this ordinance [section].

                  a.  Base density. Base density shall equal the gross tract area times the density factor. The density factor is the density of the underlying zoning district expressed as dwelling units per acre and is as follows: 
                  RS-180 zoning district: 1.45 units per acre 
                  RS-150 zoning district: 2.90 units per acre 

                   
                  2.  The base density may be increased if the development complies with one or more of the following standards. Each standard provides a development yield bonus of five percent in addition to the base development yield, unless otherwise specified. Should more than one standard be implemented, the maximum bonus permitted is 20 percent of the base density. 
                  a.  Public use of greenway land. A density increase may be granted at the discretion of the mayor and council where the proposal provides for the dedication of open space for public use, such as active and passive recreation areas, in accordance with the following standards: 
                  1)  The increase in density shall be computed on the basis of one dwelling unit per five acres of natural resource land including, but not limited to: woodlands, pastures, conservation meadows, farm fields or per half-mile of trail that becomes publicly accessible. The density shall not exceed ten percent increase over the base density. 
                  2)  The decision whether to accept an applicant's offer to dedicate land to public usage within a proposed conservation subdivision development shall be at the discretion of the mayor and council, which shall be guided by the recommendations contained in the comprehensive plan. 
                  b.  Endowment for greenway land maintenance. 
                  1)  A density increase may be granted at the discretion of the mayor and council when the applicant provides a donation to the open space maintenance endowment fund for maintenance of the lands to be conserved within the subdivision. This fund shall be transferred by the developer to the designated entity with ownership and maintenance responsibilities, i.e. a land trust, a non-profit conservation organization, or other public entity, as approved in accordance with this ordinance [section]. The purpose of this donation is to generate additional income for the recipient for the sole purpose of endowing a permanent fund to offset continuing costs of maintaining the open space, including costs associated with active or passive recreation facilities. Spending from this fund shall be restricted to expenditure of interest so that the principal may be preserved. The estimate of maintenance costs shall be prepared by an agency, firm, or organization acceptable to the City of Snellville, and with experience in managing open space and recreational facilities. The amount of the donation shall be no less than 30 times the estimated annual maintenance costs. The density bonus shall not exceed a maximum ten percent increase over the base density. 
                  c.  Reusing historical buildings and structures: The U.S. Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation of Historic Properties shall apply. 
                  d.  Preservation of additional open space (60 percent of the gross tract area of more): A density bonus shall be granted for those developments that preserve at least 60 percent of the gross tract area. The density bonus shall not exceed a maximum 15 percent increase over the base density. 
                  e.  Implementation: For each of the public purposes described above, dwellings resulting from density bonuses may be accommodated by reducing the amount of required open space acreage by up to ten percent (bonus strategy "d" excluded), reducing the minimum lot size/setback requirements by up to 20 percent, or by a combination of these approaches, provided that the mayor and council are satisfied that the public purpose objectives are being achieved. 
                  H.  Performance standards. 
                  1.  Conservation subdivisions shall identify a conservation theme or themes. This theme shall be identified at the time of the initial application.

                  11.  Average lot width: Lots for homes with front-loaded garages shall be a minimum of 40 feet in width. Lots with side-loading garages shall be a minimum of 60 feet in width. Exception: Exterior lots abutting residential property shall meet the lot width (for the entire depth of the lot) and the rear setback of the underlying, adjacent zoning district. 
                  12.  The minimum road frontage per lot is 40 feet. Exception: Road frontage may be reduced to 20 feet for lots with frontage upon cul-de-sac or "eyebrow cul-de-sac" turnarounds. 
                  13.  Minimum setbacks/lot size: 
                  a.  Front: 20 feet from right-of-way. 
                  Exception: The front yard setback may be reduced to five feet if dwellings are provided side or rear entry garages. To qualify for the reduced setback on a corner lot, side entry garages must be located to the side adjacent to an abutting lot, rather than the street. 
                  b.  Rear: 20 feet. 
                  c.  Side: Zero feet. However, there shall be a minimum 15-feet separation between principal dwellings on adjacent lots.

                  A.  Purposes, applicability and definitions. 
                  1.  Title. These regulations shall officially be known, cited, and referred to as the residential village overlay district of the City of Snellville, Georgia (hereinafter "ordinance" ["section"]). 
                  2.  Purposes and benefits. This ordinance [section] is adopted for the following purposes: 
                  a.  To create a distinct physical settlement surrounded by protected conservation space used for agricultural, silvicultural, recreational, and environmental protection purposes. 
                  b.  To develop a settlement of modest size and scale that accommodates and promotes pedestrian travel rather than motor vehicle trips. 
                  c.  To promote design that results in residential homes fronting on, and aligned with, streets. 
                  d.  To encourage the inclusion of a diversity of household types, age groups, and income levels in the City of Snellville. 
                  e.  To promote traditional village building and site development patterns with an interconnected and generally rectilinear pattern of streets, alleys, and blocks, providing for a balanced mix of pedestrians and automobiles. 
                  f.  To encourage creation of a functionally diverse, but visually unified, community focused on a central square. 
                  g.  To promote use of neighborhood greens, landscaped streets, boulevards, parkways, and "single-loaded" streets woven into street and block patterns in order to provide neighborhood identity and space for social activity, parks, and visual enjoyment. 
                  h.  To preserve conservation land, scenic vistas, agricultural lands, and natural areas. 
                  3.  Applicability and compliance. The residential village standards may apply to any parcel of 15 acres or more. The overall development density for the parent parcel is the same as would be allowed for a conventional subdivision in the existing zoning district, except for those residential villages which qualify for a density bonus. The provisions of this ordinance [section] shall apply to residential development within the following districts established in the City of Snellville Zoning Ordinance, as of the effective date of this ordinance: RS-180 and RS-150 (single family residential districts). The use of the residential village overlay district regulations shall be considered a rezoning and said action shall comply with article 15 of the Zoning Ordinance. 
                  Any conditions of zoning or special use approval of the underlying district and/or parcel shall also be observed (exception: lot area, width or quantity). The applicant shall comply with all other provisions of the zoning code and all other applicable laws. Whenever the requirements of the village residential overlay district impose a more or less restrictive standard than the provisions of the underlying zoning district stated elsewhere in the zoning ordinance, the requirements of the overlay district shall govern. The director of planning and development shall have the authority to approve alternate methods of compliance with the provisions of this ordinance [section] when he/she determines the overall intent of the article and/or specific guidelines can be met. 
                  For properties which are submitted for rezoning, the applicant shall declare the intent to utilize this overlay district at the time of application. An existing features site analysis plan and a concept plan meeting the requirements of this ordinance [section] shall accompany the rezoning application. In the absence of a declaration of intent to use the overlay district with a rezoning application, the overlay district shall not be used on rezoned property for at least two years from the date of the resolution adopting a zoning change or until a new application is filed in compliance with article 15 of the zoning ordinance and the property rezoned for use with the regulations of this ordinance [section]. The overlay district shall not be used on property that has been timber harvested within 24 months prior to adoption of a zoning change or approval of a concept plan. 
                  The tract of land to be subdivided may be held in single and separate ownership or in a multiple ownership. If held in a multiple ownership, however, the site shall be developed according to a single plan with common authority and common responsibility.

                  1.  Density and greenway land determination. 
                  a.  Density determination. Determination of the maximum number of permitted dwelling units shall be based on the gross tract area of the site. 
                  1)  Base density. Base density shall equal the Gross Tract Area times the density factor. The density factor is the density of the underlying zoning district expressed as dwelling units per acre and is as follows: 
                  RS-180 Zoning District: 1.45 units per acre 
                  RS-150 Zoning District: 2.90 units per acre 

                   
                  2)  Standard residential density bonus for village development. This bonus is provided to encourage applicants to select the village design option. Compliance with all open space, greenway land and development standards in this article and in the development regulations is required. To determine the residential density bonus for village design, base density shall be multiplied by 1.5. 

                   
                  3)  Additional residential density bonuses to further certain public objectives. Village residential density may be further increased beyond base density and the standard residential density bonus when certain public objectives pertaining to public land dedication, and conservation land endowments are achieved. Each standard provides a density bonus of five percent in addition to the base density, unless otherwise specified. The maximum bonus permitted is 20 percent of the base development yield. 
                  b.  Public use of greenway land. A density increase may be granted at the discretion of the mayor and council where the proposal provides for the dedication of greenway land for public use, such as active and passive recreation areas, in accordance with the following standards: 
                  1)  The increase in density shall be computed on the basis of one dwelling unit per five acres of natural resource land including, but not limited to: woodlands, pastures, conservation meadows, farm fields, or per half-mile of trail that becomes publicly accessible. The density shall not exceed ten percent increase over the base density. 
                  2)  The decision whether to accept an applicant's offer to dedicate land to public usage within a proposed village development shall be at the discretion of the mayor and council, which shall be guided by the recommendations contained in the comprehensive plan. 
                  c.  Endowment for greenway land maintenance. 
                  1)  A density increase may be granted at the discretion of the mayor and council when the applicant provides a donation to the greenway land maintenance endowment fund for maintenance of the lands to be conserved within the subdivision. This fund shall be transferred by the developer to the designated entity with ownership and maintenance responsibilities, i.e. a land trust, a non-profit conservation organization, or other public entity, as approved in accordance with this ordinance [section]. The purpose of this donation is to generate additional income for the recipient for the sole purpose of endowing a permanent fund to offset continuing costs of maintaining the greenway land, including costs associated with active or passive recreation facilities. Spending from this fund shall be restricted to expenditure of interest so that the principal may be preserved. The estimate of maintenance costs shall be prepared by an agency, firm, or organization acceptable to the City of Snellville, and with experience in managing greenway land and recreational facilities. The amount of the donation shall be no less than 30 times the estimated annual maintenance costs. The density bonus shall not exceed a maximum ten percent increase over the base density. 
                  d.  Preservation of additional open space (50 percent of the gross tract area of more). A density bonus shall be granted for those developments that preserve at least 50 percent of the gross tract area. The density bonus shall not exceed a maximum 15 percent increase over the base density. 
                  e.  Implementation. For each of the public purposes described above, dwellings resulting from density bonuses may be accommodated by reducing the amount of required greenway land acreage by up to ten percent (bonus strategy "c" excluded), reducing the minimum lot size/setback requirements by up to 20 percent, or by a combination of these approaches, provided that the mayor and council are satisfied that the public purpose objectives are being achieved. 
                  H.  Area and dimensional standards. 
                  1.  Each lot shall meet the following dimensional standards: 
                  a.  Area: No minimum.

                  1.  Overall form. New village development shall be generally compact with a well-defined edge between new developed areas of the village and adjacent rural, undeveloped lands, and when extending the geographical boundaries of an existing village. This shall not apply in the case of infill parcels within an existing village. Areas of new construction shall be located to best preserve natural resources, cultural features, and scenic vistas. Modification of existing topography shall be minimized to the greatest extent possible. 
                  2.  Block design. 
                  a.  Villages shall be designed in a generally rectilinear pattern of blocks and interconnecting streets and rear lanes, defined by buildings, landscaping, pedestrian ways, sidewalks and street furniture. Cul-de-sacs shall be avoided, wherever possible. To avoid the monotony of a rigid grid layout and to better conform to the natural terrain, streets may include frequent gentle curves. 
                  b.  Neighborhood streets may take the form of a two-way street, a pair of one-way streets on either side of a landscaped median, or a one-way loop street around a small neighborhood green. Streets shall be developed in accordance with the development regulations. 
                  c.  The maximum length of a block shall be 500 feet. This length may be extended up to 800 feet when mid-block footpaths are provided to connect to other streets. 
                  d.  Where cul-de-sacs and/or loop roads must be used, a minimum five-foot wide concrete path shall be provided to connect with other nearby streets. 
                  e.  Where cul-de-sacs must be used, a planter island shall be incorporated at the center of the terminus. The planter island shall have a minimum inside radius of 40 feet and shall be reinforced with a mountable rolled curb, at a minimum. 
                  f.  Rectilinear blocks of the dimensions required above may be reshaped at the discretion of the director of planning and development when topography, existing vegetation, or hydrology considerations influence block shape and size. 
                  g.  Traffic calming techniques shall include "T" intersections, traffic islands, circles, loops or crescents, and/or roundabouts. Speed bumps shall be prohibited. 
                  h.  At least 25 percent of local access streets shall terminate in "T" intersections. The distance between "T" intersections shall not exceed three blocks or 1,500 linear feet, which ever is less. "T" intersections shall meet the offset requirements from other intersections set forth in the development regulations. 
                  K.  Design standards for greenway land. 
                  1.  Greenway land shall be delineated in accordance with the standards in section 5.8 of the development regulations and additional design considerations. 
                  2.  Greenway land shall consist of two types: 
                  a.  Natural greenway land consists of, but is not limited to: meadows, woodlands, large specimen trees, hedgerows, wetlands, floodplain and steep slopes. 
                  b.  Formal greenway land consists of: greens, commons, squares and parks that are defined by building walls, streets and street trees. 
                  3.  Greens, commons, squares and parks. 
                  a.  Greens, commons, squares, and parks shall serve a variety of outdoor leisure and assembly needs of village residents and enhance the form and appearance of the village. 
                  b.  Greens, commons, squares, and parks shall be distributed throughout the village, dispersed throughout the village in such a way that no lot is more than 1,250 feet from a green, common or square. No green, commons and/or square shall be less than 8,000 square feet in size. 
                  c.  All greens shall be planted with shade trees along their edges, at intervals not greater than 50 feet. 
                  d.  The views of greens, commons and squares shall be maximized by locating greenway land in "terminal vista" locations as often as possible, such as the ends of streets at three-way intersections, and/or along the outer edges of curving streets. 
                  e.  Public benches of a design and color approved by the director of planning and development shall be provided on each block; and in greens, commons, squares, and parks, at a rate of one bench per 5,000 square feet. 
                  f.  At least one bicycle rack shall be provided in each green, common, square or park. 
                  g.  A pathway system connecting greenway/open space areas accessible to neighborhood residents, and connecting these areas to neighborhood streets and sidewalks shall be constructed. 
                  L.  Architectural design standards. 
                  1.  Prior to issuance of a site development permit for each phase of the project, if any, the developer shall submit architectural elevations in the form of a "plan book" for typical structures for review and approval by the director of planning and development. At a minimum, the "plan book" shall include: allowable building elevations; design criteria for entries, porches, doors, windows, dormers, columns, cornices, rakes, garages, roofs, landscaping, fencing, and retaining walls; exterior colors and materials, and other pertinent information. All structures shall be constructed in accordance with the approved "plan book." said "plan book" shall become a binding restriction on all structures within the development and may be amended or supplemented only by approval of the director of planning and development. 
                  2.  Homes/buildings shall be constructed of traditional design with brick, stone, masonry hardi-plank horizontal siding, and masonry hardi-plank shakes/shingles. The primary material on the front elevation shall also be used on the side and rear elevations.

                  8.  All front doors must have either a glass element in the door or sidelights and a transom surrounding it. 
                  9.  Columns on the front elevation or otherwise visible from the public view shall have a minimum two-foot base constructed of brick or stone to match the front elevation. 
                  10.  Chimneys located on an exterior elevation of the dwelling must extend to the ground and be clad in masonry or same as adjacent materials. 
                  11.  All grassed areas on dwelling lots shall be sodded with a drought-resistant grass, such as Bermuda or Centipede. 
                  12.  Single story homes shall be a minimum of 1,700 square feet. Two story homes shall be a minimum of 1,800 square feet.

                  Section 9.18. - R-HOP, Housing for older persons. 
                  Purpose: These districts are designed to serve the housing needs of adults who are 55 years of age or older. It is recommended that these districts be located in areas that facilitate pedestrian access to nearby commercial goods and services, and/or amenities/cultural facilities. These areas are intended to function as communities with parks and open spaces. At least 80 percent of the occupied units shall be occupied by at least one person who is 55 years of age or older. The other 20 percent is not intended as a set aside for younger residents and efforts should be made to minimize the number of units that do not meet this requirement. A rezoning to the R-HOP classification will not serve as a precedent for medium density zoning in an otherwise low density residential area. 
                  The following design standards shall apply to all R-HOP districts: 
                  (1)  Site and architectural design standards. 
                  A.  A landscape strip(s) shall be provided on the property. The landscape strip may incorporate natural vegetation and shall be supplemented with a minimum of one of the following: 1) a landscaped berm (minimum of four feet as measured from the elevation of the public right-of-way, 2) wrought-iron style fence with brick or stone columns (30 feet on-center), or 3) a decorative brick wall. Alternate decorative fence materials may be utilized, subject to review and approval of the director. Plantings shall comply with article XX of the zoning ordinance. 
                  B.  Street trees shall be planted in the right-of-way, in accordance with the details provided in Appendix XX-A. Street trees shall be planted no further than 50 feet apart and no closer than 25 feet from street intersections. The city arborist may approve alternate spacing when the 50-foot spacing requirement cannot be met due to driveways and other improvements. All street trees must comply with requirements listed in section 20.6 of the City of Snellville's Zoning Ordinance. 
                  C.  All grassed areas shall be sodded. 
                  D.  Homes/buildings shall be constructed of traditional design with brick, stone, masonry horizontal siding, and masonry shakes/shingles. Brick and/or stone shall constitute no less than 70 percent of the materials used, with accents of masonry siding or shakes/shingles for each building elevation. 
                  E.  All dwellings shall contain single-car garages, at a minimum, which may be attached or detached. All units with front-loaded garages shall have garage faces with decorative design treatments to enhance their appearances, i.e. carriage-style doors, window inserts, etc. 
                  F.  Provide five-foot wide sidewalks and street trees adjacent to both sides of interior streets or private driveways. 
                  G.  A paved five-foot wide pathway/sidewalk system shall be constructed which connects outdoor amenities/recreation areas, homes, clubhouse, and other amenities. 
                  H.  A four-foot wide walkway, constructed of concrete or decorative pavers, shall extend from the sidewalk to the steps, stoop, or porch of all homes. 
                  I.  There shall be no open space requirement for developments in the R-HOP districts. 
                  J.  Street lights within the subdivision shall be located 75 feet apart on average. 
                  (2)  Building design standards. 
                  A.  All dwellings shall incorporate accessibility standards which shall include the following: 
                  1.  A step-free feature to at least one entrance of the unit. 
                  2.  36-inch wide, clear passage doorways throughout the unit. 
                  3.  Wheelchair, step-free access to the following areas, at a minimum: kitchen; dining area; entertainment area (e.g., living room/den, great room, etc.); at least one bedroom; at least one full bathroom; and laundry room with washer/dryer connection. 
                  4.  The installation of full sheets of ¾-inch plywood, blocking and/or its equivalent in all bathrooms to allow for future installation, if necessary, of grab bars. 
                  (3)  Mandatory homeowner's association required. A mandatory homeowners association shall be incorporated for all R-HOP districts which provides for building and grounds maintenance and repair, insurance and working capital. Said association shall publish and adhere to policies and procedures that demonstrate that the community is intended to provide housing for persons 55 years of age and older including maintaining surveys or affidavits verifying compliance with 55 years of age and older occupancy requirements as permitted by 42 U.S.C. Section 3607, (b)(2)(c) of the Federal Fair Housing Act and implementing regulations. Said association shall provide an affirmative declaration to be governed by the "Georgia Property Owners' Association Act' (POA) and the applicable provisions of O.C.G.A. § 44-3-220 et seq. Said association shall also include declarations and bylaws including rules and regulations, which shall at a minimum regulate and control the following:

                  B.  Restrictions on persons under 18 years of age permanently residing in the community. Permanently residing in the community shall mean longer than 90 consecutive days in any 180-day period or establishing residency as defined by state or local law. However, the HOA shall provide for a hardship provision allowing for an owner/occupant to house and care for a child less than 18 years of age in situations where the owner/occupant assumes responsibility for caring for the child due to urgent circumstances stemming from actions not under the owner/occupant's control. The association may, but is not required to, allow for hardship exceptions to this requirement. 
                  C.  Restrictions on single-family residential use only and leasing of units. Except in CCRC units, no more than ten percent of the total units may be leased by individual owners at any one time. 
                  D.  Except for a central amenity package, prohibit playground equipment, trampolines or like fixtures. 
                  E.  The HOA shall also provide that the covenants automatically renew at the end of the 20-year term, unless 100 percent of the owners at that time vote that the covenants should not renew. 
                  F.  The HOA and/or community management association for the HOA shall give written notice to any grantee of the restrictions covered in this zoning at or before any sale or transfer of any property. 
                  (4)  Covenants and restrictions. Legally binding covenants and/or deed restrictions that run with the land shall apply to all R-HOP housing units that will bind the applicant, any assignee, mortgagee, or buyer, and all other parties that receive title to the property. The grantor must state in any deed or instrument conveying title to a R-HOP housing unit, that the property conveyed is intended to be housing for older persons and is subject to the restrictions contained in this section. No covenant referencing any of the regulations or restrictions herein for a housing for older persons housing unit shall be recorded until and unless said covenant contains restrictions approved by the director of planning and development that are consistent with the requirements of this section. Such review and response shall be completed within 30 calendar days following date of submission of such documents to the director of planning and development. 
                  (5)  Concept plan review required. All rezoning applications for the R-HOP districts shall be accompanied by a concept plan in compliance with this article. The purpose of the concept plan review is to encourage logic, imagination, innovation, and variety in the design process and ensure the soundness of the proposed development and its compatibility with the surrounding area. The director of planning and development or his/her designee shall review plans for compliance with concept plan review criteria and the zoning ordinance. The recommendations of both the director of planning and development and the planning commission shall be transmitted to the mayor and council. Through the rezoning process, the mayor and council may condition approval of an R-HOP request to a specific concept plan or require an additional future site plan review by the planning commission and mayor and council. 
                  The following exhibits shall be prepared by registered design professionals, such as planners, engineers, architects or landscape architects, and submitted to the department of planning and development. No application for an R-HOP development shall be accepted for processing without these required exhibits:

                  k.  Such other architectural and engineering data as may be required to evaluate the project. 
                  (6)  Authority to adopt additional standards and requirements. Where the provisions of this article do not provide sufficient specificity in terms of administration, the director of planning and development is hereby authorized to prepare and apply additional standards and qualifications for administering the requirements of this section. If prepared, said standards and requirements shall be titled "Housing for Older Persons Zoning Implementation Standards and Procedures" and shall be public record. The director of planning and development is required to seek approval by resolution of said administrative procedures and standards by the mayor and council. 
                  The director of planning and development shall be responsible for adopting and implementing policies for the monitoring and enforcement of mandatory homeowner's association requirements. 
                  The director of planning and development shall publish and the city shall adhere to policies and procedures that demonstrate that communities in this zoning classification are intended to provide housing for persons 55 years of age and older including maintaining surveys or affidavits verifying compliance with 55 years of age and older occupancy requirements as permitted by 42 U.S.C.

                  A.  It is the intent of this ordinance that all buildings, structures and uses of land shall provide off-street parking and loading space in an amount sufficient to meet the needs caused by the building or use of land and that such parking and loading spaces be so oriented that they are in fact readily useable for such purposes. 
                  B.  Each use of land and each building or structure hereafter constructed or established, and each addition to a structure in excess of 200 square feet except as herein provided, shall provide off-street parking and loading according to the standards set forth herein. When an addition is made to a building nonconforming as to parking or loading requirements, a conforming amount of parking or loading shall be supplied based upon the size of the addition. 
                  C.  No addition to an existing building shall be constructed which reduces the number of spaces, area or usability of existing parking or loading space unless such building and its addition conform with the regulations for parking and loading contained herein. 
                  D.  Parking spaces for the handicapped shall be required. Existing uses providing off-street parking shall have 12 months from date of adoption of this ordinance to comply with handicapped parking requirements. New uses providing off-street parking shall incorporate handicapped spaces into the design of parking facilities.

                  Section 12.1. - Purpose and intent. 
                  The Mayor and Council of the City of Snellville recognize that signage is an important medium through which individuals may communicate commercial and noncommercial messages.

                  It is hereby declared that the aesthetic and safety interests of the City of Snellville are reasonably promoted by the provisions of this article. Accordingly, it is the intent and purpose of this article to: 
                  a.  Balance the rights of individuals to convey their messages through signs and the right of the public to protected against unrestricted proliferation of signs; 
                  b.  Further the objectives of the city's comprehensive plan which is expressly incorporated herein; 
                  c.  Protect the public health, welfare and safety of our citizens and others who may visit the city; 
                  d.  Reduce traffic and pedestrian hazards; 
                  e.  Promote the aesthetic qualities of the city; 
                  f.  Promote economic development of the city; and 
                  g.  Ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of the sign regulations. 
                  Notwithstanding any other restrictions in this article, signs authorized under this article can contain commercial or noncommercial messages. 
                  While developing this article, the mayor and council, planning commission, and staff considered and reviewed numerous studies that considered the relationship between advertising signage, public perception and traffic issues. Among the items reviewed were: 
                  a.  U.S. Small Business Administration, "Signage for Your Business";

                  If an application for a variance or waiver is denied by the board of appeals, a reapplication for such variance or waiver may not be made earlier than 12 months from the date of the original application. 
                  The planning and development director or his/her designee shall have the power to grant administrative variances from the development standards of the zoning ordinance, where, in his opinion, the intent of the zoning ordinance can be achieved and equal performance obtained by granting a variance. In the planned residential conservation (PRC) and R-HOP districts, the planning and development director or his/her designee is restricted to granting no more than 25 percent reduction of the normal administrative variance authorized in this section. The authority to grant such variances shall be limited, with one exception, to variance from the following requirements: 
                  1.  Front yard or yard adjacent to public street—Variance not to exceed five feet. 
                  2.  Side yard variance not to exceed two feet. 
                  3.  Rear yard variance not to exceed four feet. 
                  4.  Height of building—Variance not to exceed five feet. 
                  5.  Side or rear yard—A variance for a zero foot setback may be granted when part of a commercial development and planned as a unit having a similar architectural composition and not a miscellaneous assemblage of stores, provided however, that prior to any issuance of the variance, the applicant shall obtain approval from the affected side and/or rear yard property owner(s). 
                  6.  Sidewalk setback—Variance for a zero foot setback. 
                  The one exception would cover structures that preceded the zoning ordinance and do not conform to the ordinance as written. Consideration for a variance would be given when ownership was changing and the mortgage company required conformity to the zoning ordinance.

                  Footnotes: 
                  --- (12) --- 
                  Cross reference— Utilities, ch. 62. 

                  Section 19.1. - Purpose and intent. 
                  The purpose of this ordinance is to establish general guidelines for the siting of telecommunication towers and antennas. The goals of this ordinance are to: 
                  A.  Encourage the location of towers in nonresidential areas and minimize the total number of towers throughout the community, 
                  B.  Encourage the joint use of new and existing tower sites, 
                  C.  Encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them, to the extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the community is minimal, 
                  D.  Encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a way that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers and antennas, and 
                  E.  Enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services to provide such services to the community quickly, effectively, and efficiently. 
                  Section 19.2. - Definitions. 
                  As used in this ordinance, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated: 
                  Alternative tower structure: Manmade trees, clock towers, bell steeples, light poles and similar alternative design mounting structures that camouflage or conceal the presence of telecommunication antennas or towers. 
                  Antenna: Any exterior apparatus designed for telephonic, radio, or television communications through the sending and/or receiving of electromagnetic waves. 
                  Commercial zoning district: A zoning district that does not permit as a principal permitted use any type of single-family or multifamily use. 
                  FAA: The Federal Aviation Administration. 
                  FCC: The Federal Communications Commission. 
                  Height: When referring to a tower or other structure, the distance measured from ground level to the highest point on the tower or other structure, even if said highest point is an antenna. 
                  Preexisting towers and antennas: Any tower or antenna for which a permit has been properly issued prior to the adoption of this ordinance. 
                  Public officer: As used in O.C.G.A. § 41-2-17, shall mean the zoning [code] enforcement officer of the City of Snellville. 
                  Tower: Any structure that is designed and constructed primarily for the purpose of supporting one or more antennas, including self-supporting lattice towers, guy towers, or monopole towers. The term includes radio and television transmission towers, microwave towers, common-carrier towers, cellular telephone towers, alternative tower structures, and the like. 
                  Section 19.3. - Applicability. 
                  A.  District height limitations. The requirements set forth in this ordinance shall govern the height and location of towers and antennas. The height limitations applicable to buildings and structures shall not apply to towers and antennas. 
                  B.  Public property. Antennas or towers located on property owned, leased, or otherwise controlled by the City of Snellville shall be exempt from the requirements of this ordinance, provided a license or lease authorizing such antenna or tower has been approved by the City of Snellville. 
                  C.  Amateur radio; receive-only antennas. This ordinance shall not govern any tower, or the installation of any antenna, that is owned and operated by a federally licensed amateur radio station operator or is used exclusively for receive only antennas. 
                  D.  Preexisting towers and antennas. Any tower or antenna for which a permit has been properly issued prior to the effective date of this ordinance shall not be required to meet the requirements of this ordinance, other than the requirements of sections 19.4(D) and (E). Any such towers or antennas shall be referred to in this ordinance as "preexisting towers" or "preexisting antennas." 
                  Section 19.4. - General requirements. 
                  A.  Principal or accessory use. Antennas and towers may be considered either principal or accessory uses. A different existing use or an existing structure on the same lot shall not preclude the installation of an antenna or tower on such lot. For purposes of determining whether the installation of a tower or antenna complies with district development regulations, including but not limited to, setback requirements, lot coverage requirements, and other such requirements, the dimensions of the entire lot shall control, even though the antennas or towers may be located on leased parcels within such lots. Towers that are constructed, and antennas that are installed, in accordance with the provisions of the ordinance shall not be deemed to constitute the expansion of a nonconforming use or structure. 
                  B.  Inventory of existing sites. Each applicant for an antenna and or tower shall provide to the planning and zoning department an inventory of its existing towers that are either within the jurisdiction of the City of Snellville or within three miles of the border thereof, including specific information about the location, height, and design of each tower. The planning and zoning department may share such information with other applicants applying for conditional use permits under this ordinance or other organizations seeking to locate antennas within the jurisdiction of the City of Snellville; provided, however, that the planning and zoning department is not, by sharing such information, in any way representing or warranting that such sites are available or suitable. 
                  C.  Aesthetics; lighting. The guidelines set forth shall govern the location of all towers, and the installation of all antennas, governed by this ordinance; provided, however, that the City of Snellville may waive these requirements if it determines that the goals of this ordinance are better served thereby. 
                  1.  Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, be painted a neutral color, so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness. 
                  2.  At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and built environment. 
                  3.  If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible. 
                  4.  Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the City of Snellville may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views. 
                  5.  Signage shall be prohibited on all structures. 
                  D.  Federal requirements. All towers must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed, then the owners of the towers and antennas governed by this ordinance shall bring such towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six months of the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a more stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal agency. Failure to bring towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at the owner's expense. Any such removal by the City of Snellville shall be in the manner provided in O.C.G.A. §§ 41-2-8—41-2-17. 
                  E.  Building codes; safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity of towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes and the applicable standards for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries Association, as amended from time to time. If, upon inspection, the City of Snellville concludes that a tower fails to comply with such codes and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to the owner of the tower, the owner shall have 30 days to bring such tower into compliance with such standards. If the owner fails to bring such tower into compliance within said 30 days, the City of Snellville may remove such tower at the owner's expense. Any such removal by the City of Snellville shall be in the manner provided in O.C.G.A. §§ 41-2-8—41-2-17. 
                  F.  Security fencing. Towers shall be enclosed by an opaque security fencing not less than eight feet in height and shall be equipped with an appropriate anticlimbing device; provided, however, that the City of Snellville may waive such requirements, as it deems appropriate. 
                  G.  Landscaping. The following guidelines shall govern the landscaping surrounding towers for which a conditional use permit is required; provided, however, that the City of Snellville may waive such requirements if the goals of this ordinance would be better served thereby. 
                  1.  Tower facilities shall be landscaped with a buffer of evergreen plant materials that effectively screens the view of the tower compound from adjacent residential property. 
                  A.  Standard buffer shall consist of a landscaped strip at least five feet wide outside the perimeter of the compound. 
                  B.  Landscape shall be developed in accordance with article XX of the Snellville Zoning Ordinance of 2001 [this appendix]. 
                  2.  Existing mature tree growth and natural land forms on the site shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. In some cases, such as towers sited on large, wooded lots, natural growth around the property perimeter may be sufficient buffer. 
                  Section 19.5. - Conditional use permits. 
                  A.  General. Conditional use permits [are] subject to provisions of section 15.10 of the Snellville Zoning Ordinance of 2001 [this appendix]. The following provisions shall govern the issuance of conditional use permits: 
                  1.  A conditional use permit shall be required for the construction of a tower or the placement of an antenna in all zoning districts. 
                  2.  In granting a conditional use permit, the council may impose conditions to the extent necessary to minimize any adverse effect of the proposed tower on adjoining properties. 
                  3.  Any information of an engineering nature submitted by the applicant, whether civil, mechanical, or electrical, shall be certified by a licensed professional engineer. 
                  B.  Information required. Each applicant requesting a conditional use permit under this ordinance shall submit a scaled site plan, scaled elevation view and other supporting drawings, calculations, and/or other documentation, signed and sealed by licensed professional engineers, showing the location and dimensions of all improvements, including information concerning topography, radio frequency coverage, tower height requirements, setbacks, drives, parking, fencing, landscaping, adjacent uses, and other information deemed by the City of Snellville to be necessary to assess compliance with this ordinance. 
                  C.  Factors considered in granting conditional use permits. The city council and mayor shall consider the following factors in determining whether to issue a conditional use permit, although the City of Snellville may waive or reduce the burden on the applicant of these criteria, if the City of Snellville, concludes that the goals of this ordinance are better served thereby. 
                  1.  Height of the proposed tower. 
                  2.  Proximity of the tower to residential structures and residential district boundaries. 
                  3.  Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties. 
                  4.  Surrounding topography. 
                  5.  Surrounding tree coverage and foliage. 
                  6.  Design of the tower, with particular reference to design characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual obtrusiveness. 
                  7.  Availability of suitable existing towers and other structures as discussed in section 19.4(D) of this ordinance [article]. 
                  D.  Availability of suitable existing towers or other structures. No new tower shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the City of Snellville that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna may consist of any of the following: 
                  1.  No existing towers or structures are located within the geographic area required to meet applicant's engineering requirements. 
                  2.  Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to meet applicant's engineering requirements. 
                  3.  Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment. 
                  4.  The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the existing towers or structures, or the antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the applicant's proposed antenna. 
                  5.  The fees, or costs, or contractual provisions required by the owner in order to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower or structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development are presumed unreasonable. 
                  6.  The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render existing towers and structures unsuitable. 
                  E.  Setbacks and separation. The following setbacks and separation requirements shall apply to all towers and antennas for which a conditional use permit is required. 
                  1.  Towers must be set back at least 125% of total height of tower from the property line of a residentially zoned property. 
                  2.  Towers, guys, and accessory facilities must satisfy the minimum zoning district setback requirements. 
                  3.  In zoning districts other than light manufacturing (LM), towers over 90 feet in height shall not be located within one-quarter of a mile from any existing tower that is over 90 feet in height. 
                  Section 19.6. - Removal of abandoned antennas and towers. 
                  Any antenna or tower that ceases to operated for a period of 12 months shall be considered abandoned, and the owner of such antenna or tower shall remove same within 90 days of receipt of notice from the City of Snellville notifying the owner of such abandonment. If such antenna or tower is not removed within said 90 days, the governing authority may, in the manner provided in O.C.G.A. §§ 41-2-8—41-2-17, remove such antenna or tower at the owner's expense. If there are two or more users of a single tower, then this provision shall not become effective until all users cease using the tower. 
                  Section 19.7. - Effective date. 
                  This ordinance shall become effective 30 days after its approval by the city council and mayor of the City of Snellville. 
                  Section 19.8. - Validity. 
                  Should any section or provision of this ordinance be declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the ordinance in whole or any part thereof other than the part so declared invalid. 
                  Section 19.9. - Appeal. 
                  Any person aggrieved or affected by any decision of the public officer relating to the application of the these regulations may appeal to the zoning board of appeals for relief or reconsideration within 30 days from the date of the adverse decision of the public officer. 
                  Section 19.10. - Conflicting ordinances repealed.
