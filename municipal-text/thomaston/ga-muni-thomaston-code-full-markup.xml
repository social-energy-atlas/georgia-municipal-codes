PREFACE

         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Thomaston, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1965 Code, as supplemented through May 1994, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1965 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Palmer Carr, Supervising Editor, and Robert McNaughton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Ronald Barfield, City Attorney, and Mr. David Dunaway, Assistant City Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

                  (1)  To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by an administrative official in the enforcement of any zoning ordinance or resolution. 
                  (2)  To hear and decide special exceptions to the terms of any zoning ordinance or resolution upon which such board is required to pass under such ordinance or resolution. 
                  (3)  To authorize upon appeal in specific cases such variance from the terms of the zoning ordinance or resolution as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of the ordinance or resolution will, in an individual case, result in unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of the ordinance or resolution shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. Such variance may be granted in such individual case of unnecessary hardship upon a finding by the board of zoning appeals that: 
                  a.  There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape, or topography; 
                  b.  The application of the ordinance or resolution to this particular piece of property would create an unnecessary hardship; 
                  c.  Such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of property involved; and 
                  d.  Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purposes and intent of the ordinance or resolution; provided, however, that no variance may be granted for a use of land or building or structure that is prohibited by the ordinance or resolution. 
                  In exercising the powers described in this section, the board of zoning appeals may, in conformity with the provisions of this division, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision, or determination, and to that end shall have all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken and may issue or direct the issuance of a permit.

                  ARTICLE V. - CODE OF ETHICS 

                  Sec. 2-170. - Basic constitutional principles of ethical governance. 
                  All government, of right, originates with the people and is founded upon their will only, and is instituted solely for the good of the whole. Public officers are the trustees and servants of the people and are at all times amenable to them. See Georgia Constitution, Article I, Section II, Paragraph I. 
                  (Ord. No. 966, § 1, 9-2-03) 
                  Sec. 2-171. - Public servants are trustees. 
                  The public trust requires public servants to fulfill their duties faithfully and honestly and to subordinate any personal interest which conflicts with the public interest. A public servant is a trustee of the people and should strive to further the general welfare and not use public office in order to improve his or her own private standing. The principal policies which form the foundation of this code of ethics are: 
                  (1)  The trust of citizens in their government is cultivated when individual public servants act with integrity and when the public is aware that its servants act with integrity. 
                  (2)  The Constitutions, laws and regulations of the United States and the state and ordinances of the city should be upheld as a de minimus standard of conduct. 
                  (3)  The most effective way to eradicate unethical practices is to consistently act with the highest moral principles and to consistently react appropriately to the ethical decisions of others. 
                  (4)  Elected officials should exercise sound judgment and apply ethical principles in making decisions that in any manner reflect upon their elected office. 
                  (5)  All citizens should be treated with courtesy, impartiality, and equality. 
                  (Ord. No. 966, § 1, 9-2-03) 
                  Sec. 2-172. - Intent. 
                  It is the intent of this code of ethics that neither the mayor nor any member of city council shall knowingly engage in any activity which is incompatible with the proper discharge of his or her official duties, or which would tend to impair his or her judgment or actions in the performance of his or her official duties. Furthermore the mayor, and the members of city council, should avoid any action which might result in or create the appearance of the following: 
                  (1)  Using public office for private gain. 
                  (2)  Impeding city efficiency or economy. 
                  (3)  Affecting adversely the confidence of the public in the integrity of those who conduct the affairs and business of the city. 
                  (Ord. No. 966, § 1, 9-2-03) 
                  Sec. 2-173. - Definitions. 
                  Whenever used in this code of ethics the following terms shall have the meaning ascribed to them unless the context clearly indicates a different meaning. 
                  Benefit: 
                  (1)  Anything regardless of its monetary value, perceived or intended by either the one who offers it or the one to whom it is offered, to be sufficient in value to influence the mayor or a member of city council in the performance or nonperformance of an official action; or, 
                  (2)  Anything, regardless of its monetary value, which, under the circumstances, a reasonably prudent person would recognize as being likely to be intended to influence the elected official in the performance or nonperformance of an official action. 
                  City means the City of Thomaston, Georgia. 
                  Council member, city council member or member of council means any person then in office as a member of the city council, as well as any person who has been elected to that office but not yet sworn in. 
                  Elected official means a person elected by the electors of the city to a public office, including those who have been elected but not yet sworn in. 
                  Employee means any person who is employed in a position described in the job classification plan of the city; any person employed part-time by any department of the city; and any person who is employed through a contractual agreement with the city, not, however, including independent contractors. 
                  Government means the City of Thomaston, Georgia. 
                  Immediate family means spouse, child, parent or sibling of an elected official. 
                  Interest means a financial interest. A financial interest exists when any direct or indirect financial gain may accrue to an elected official as a result of the matter that is, or may be, the subject of an official act or action by, or with, the city. Interest shall not mean any direct or indirect financial gain which accrues to an elected official as a member of a class or group of people, such as the stockholders of a public corporation. 
                  Mayor shall mean the person who holds the office of mayor as well as any person who has been elected to that office but not yet sworn in. 
                  (Ord. No. 966, § 1, 9-2-03) 
                  Sec. 2-174. - Acceptance of certain benefits prohibited. 
                  An elected official shall not solicit or accept, directly or indirectly, any benefit from any person, corporation, or group which has, or is seeking to obtain, contractual or other business or financial relationships with the city. 
                  (Ord. No. 966, § 1, 9-2-03) 
                  Sec. 2-175. - Financial interests. 
                  (a)  An elected official shall not: 
                  (1)  Have a direct or indirect financial interest that conflicts with his or her responsibilities and duties as a trustee of the public good. 
                  (2)  Either directly or indirectly engage in a financial transaction as a result of, or primarily relying upon, information obtained in the course of his or her office or received due to his or her position. 
                  (b)  An elected official shall be deemed to have a financial interest in a transaction in which: 
                  (1)  Any person in the elected official's immediate family has an interest. 
                  (2)  A contractual relationship exists whereby the elected official may receive any payment or other benefits.

                  (Ord. No. 935, § 4, 12-4-01; Ord. No. 951, § 9, 11-12-02; Ord. No. 1011, 10-2-07) 
                  Sec. 18-125. - Procedure. 
                  (a)  Whenever a request is filed with the public officer by a public authority or by at least five residents of the city charging that any dwelling, building, structure, or property is unfit for human habitation or for commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, or whenever it appears to the public officer (on his own motion) that any dwelling, building, structure, or property is unfit for human habitation or for commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes, is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes, or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the public officer shall make an investigation or inspection of the specific dwelling, building, structure, or property. If the officer's investigation or inspection identifies that any dwelling, building, structure, or property is unfit for human habitation or for commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the public officer may issue a complaint in rem against the lot, tract, or parcel of real property on which such dwelling, building, or structure is situated or where such public health hazard or general nuisance exists and shall cause summons and a copy of the complaint to be served on the interested parties for such dwelling, building, or structure. The complaint shall identify the subject real property by appropriate street address and official tax map reference; identify the interested parties; state with particularity the factual basis for the action; and contain a statement of the action sought by the public officer to abate the alleged nuisance. The summons shall notify the interested parties that a hearing will be held before the municipal court of the city, at a date and time certain and at the municipal courtroom in the city. Such hearing shall be held not less than 15 days nor more than 45 days after the filing of said complaint in the municipal court. The interested parties shall have the right to file an answer to the complaint and to appear in person or by attorney and offer testimony at the time and place fixed for hearing; 
                  (b)  If, after such notice and hearing, the court determines that the dwelling, building, or structure in question is unfit for human habitation or is unfit for its current commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the court shall state in writing findings of fact in support of such determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the interested parties that have answered the complaint or appeared at the hearing an order: 
                  (1)  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter, or improve such dwelling, building, or structure so as to bring it into full compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violation and, if applicable, to secure the structure so that it cannot be used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or 
                  (2)  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure in order to bring it into full compliance with applicable codes relevant to the cited violations cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to demolish and remove such dwelling, building, or structure and all debris from the property. 
                  (c)  For purposes of this Code section, the court shall make its determination of "reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure" without consideration of the value of the land on which the structure is situated; provided, however, that costs of the preparation necessary to repair, alter, or improve a structure may be considered. Income and financial status of the owner shall not be factors in the court's determination. The present value of the structure and the costs of repair, alteration, or improvement may be established by affidavits of real estate appraisers with a Georgia appraiser classification as provided in O.C.G.A. tit. 43, ch. 39A, qualified building contractors, or qualified building inspectors without actual testimony presented. Costs of repair, alteration, or improvement of the structure shall be the cost necessary to bring the structure into compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violations in force in the city; 
                  (d)  If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair or demolish the dwelling, building, or structure, the public officer may cause such dwelling, building, or structure to be repaired, altered, or improved or to be vacated and closed or demolished. Such abatement action shall commence within 270 days after the expiration of time specified in the order for abatement by the owner. Any time during which such action is prohibited by a court order issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 41-2-13 or any other equitable relief granted by a court of competent jurisdiction shall not be counted toward the 270 days in which such abatement action must commence. The public officer shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of the building, dwelling, or structure a placard with the following words: 
                  "This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business use and does not comply with the applicable codes or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with drug crimes or constitutes an endangerment to public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful." 
                  (e)  If the public officer has the structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any moneys received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. The public officer and the city are relieved of any and all liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials; and 
                  (f)  That the amount of the cost of demolition, including all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the tax commissioner, and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, including restoration to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred. 
                  (g)  (1)  The lien provided for in paragraph (f) of this section shall attach to the real property upon the filing of a certified copy of the order requiring repair, closure, or demolition in the office of the clerk of superior court in Upson county and shall relate back to the date of the filing of the lis pendens notice required under subsection (c) of O.C.G.A. § 41-2-12. The clerk of superior court shall record and index such certified copy of the order in the deed records of the county and enter the lien on the general execution docket. The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except liens for taxes to which the lien shall be inferior, and shall continue in force until paid. 
                  (2)  Upon final determination of costs, fees, and expenses incurred in accordance with this chapter, the public officer responsible for enforcement actions in accordance with this chapter shall transmit to the county tax commissioner a statement of the total amount due and secured by said lien, together with copies of all notices provided to interested parties. The statement of the public officer shall be transmitted within 90 days of completion of the repairs, demolition, or closure. It shall be the duty of the county tax commissioner, who is responsible or whose duties include the collection of municipal taxes, to collect the amount of the lien using all methods available for collecting real property ad valorem taxes, including specifically O.C.G.A. tit. 48, ch. 4; provided, however, that the limitation of O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 which requires 12 months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure shall not apply. The county tax commissioner shall collect and enforce municipal liens imposed pursuant to this chapter in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 48-5-359.1. The county tax commissioner shall remit the amount collected to the governing authority of the city. 
                  (3)  Enforcement of liens pursuant to this section may be initiated at any time following receipt by the county tax commissioner of the final determination of costs in accordance with this chapter. The unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties from and after the date of final determination of costs in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes. An enforcement proceeding pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 for delinquent ad valorem taxes may include all amounts due under this chapter. 
                  (4)  The redemption amount in any enforcement proceeding pursuant to this section shall be the full amount of the costs as finally determined in accordance with this section together with interest, penalties, and costs incurred by the governing authority and the county tax commissioner in the enforcement of such lien. Redemption of property from the lien may be made in accordance with the provisions of O.C.G.A. §§ 48-4-80 and 48-4-81. 
                  (h)  The governing authority may waive and release any such lien imposed on property upon the owner of such property entering into a contract with the city agreeing to a timetable for rehabilitation of the real property or the dwelling, building, or structure on the property and demonstrating the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation. 
                  (i)  Review of a court order requiring the repair, alteration, improvement, or demolition of a dwelling, building, or structure shall be by direct appeal to the superior court under O.C.G.A. § 5-3-29. 
                  (j)  In addition to the procedures and remedies in this chapter, a governing authority may provide by ordinance that designated public officers may issue citations for violations of state minimum standard codes, optional building, fire, life safety, and other codes adopted by ordinance, and conditions creating a public health hazard or general nuisance, and seek to enforce such citations in a court of competent jurisdiction prior to issuing a complaint in rem as provided in this section. 
                  (k)  Nothing in this section shall be construed to impair or limit in any way the power of the city to define and declare nuisances and to cause their removal or abatement by summary proceedings or otherwise.

                  Sec. 46-42. - Duty of owners. 
                  It is the duty of the owner of every dwelling, building, structure, or property within the city to construct and maintain such dwelling, building, structure, or property in conformance with applicable codes in force within the city, or such ordinances which regulate and prohibit activities on property and which declare it to be a public nuisance to construct or maintain any dwelling, building, structure, or property in violation of such codes or ordinances.

                  The chief of police, any person employed by the city, or any other person designated or appointed by the city manager, who is assigned the duty to enforce the building codes in effect in the city, referred to in this article as the "public officer," and their agents, are hereby designated and appointed to enforce this division and exercise the powers prescribed in this division. 
                  (Ord. No. 951, § 3, 11-12-02) 
                  Sec. 46-44. - Procedure. 
                  (a)  Whenever a request is filed with the public officer by a public authority (as defined in O.C.G.A. § 41-2-8(9)) or by at least five residents of the city charging that on any private property in the city there exits an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions to those persons residing or working in the vicinity thereof, or whenever it appears to the public officer (on his own motion) that any private property in the city is an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, which create a public health hazard or general nuisance to those persons residing or working in the vicinity thereof, the public officer shall make an investigation or inspection of the specific property. If the officer's investigation or inspection identifies that any such property is an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions or a general nuisance to those persons residing or working in the vicinity thereof, the public officer may issue and cause to be served on the owner and any parties in interest (as defined in O.C.G.A. § 41-2-8(7) and (8), a complaint stating the charges in that respect and shall cause summons and a copy of the complaint to be served on the owner and parties in interest (as defined in O.C.G.A. § 41-2-8(7) and (8)) in such property. The complaint shall identify the subject real property by appropriate street address and official tax map reference; identify the owner and parties in interest; state with particularity the factual basis for the action; and contain a statement of the action sought by the public officer to abate the alleged nuisance. The summons shall notify the owner and parties in interest that a hearing will be held before the municipal court of the city, at a date and time certain. Such hearing shall be held not less than 15 days nor more than 45 days after the filing of said complaint in the municipal court. The owner and parties in interest shall have the right to file an answer to the complaint and to appear in person or by attorney and offer testimony at the time and place fixed for hearing; 
                  (b)  If, after such notice and hearing, the court determines that the property in question constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety or a general nuisance to those persons residing or working in the vicinity thereof as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the court shall state in writing findings of fact in support of such determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner and any parties in interest that have answered the complaint or appeared at the hearing an order, based upon the facts found, describing those conditions which have been determined to be in violation of this division, and specifying a reasonable time within which the violations shall be corrected. 
                  (c)  If the owner or parties in interest fail to comply with any order to correct the specified violations of this division within the time prescribed in such order, the court shall have the authority to order the public officer to correct the violations of this division that exist on the property in question. 
                  (d)  The amount of the cost of correcting the conditions, which exist on such property including all court costs, administrative costs incurred by the tax commissioner, and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred. 
                  (e)  (1)  The lien provided for in subsection (d) of this section shall attach to the real property upon the filing of a certified copy of the order requiring the correction of the violations in the office of the clerk of superior court of the county and shall relate back to the date of the filing of the lis pendens notice required under subsection (g) of section 46-45 of this division. The clerk of superior court shall record and index such certified copy of the order in the deed records of the county and enter the lien on the general execution docket. The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except liens for taxes to which the lien shall be inferior, and shall continue in force until paid. After filing a certified copy of the order with the clerk of superior court, the public officer shall forward a copy of the order and a final statement of costs to the county tax commissioner. It shall be the duty of the county tax commissioner to collect the amount of the lien in conjunction with the collection of ad valorem taxes on the property and to collect the amount of the lien as if it were a real property ad valorem tax, using all methods available for collecting real property ad valorem taxes, including specifically chapter 4 of title 48 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated; provided, however, that the limitation of O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 which requires 12 months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure shall not apply. The tax commissioner shall remit the amount collected to the governing authority of the city. Thirty days after imposition of the lien, the unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes. 
                  (2)  The tax commissioner shall collect and retain an amount equal to the cost of administering a lien authorized by this code section unless such costs are waived by resolution of the county governing authority. Any such amount collected and retained for administration shall be deposited in the general fund of the county to pay the cost of administering the lien. 
                  (f)  Review of a court order requiring the correction of violations shall be by direct appeal to the superior court under O.C.G.A. § 5-3-29. 
                  (g)  Nothing in this article shall be construed to impair or limit in any way the power of the city to define and declare nuisances and to cause their removal or abatement by summary proceedings or otherwise.

                  (2)  Pursuant to the provisions of Article 5 of Chapter 4 of Title 48 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated; or 
                  (3)  Statutory overnight delivery. 
                  (b)  If any owner or party in interest is a resident of this state but resides outside of the county, service shall be perfected by certified mail or statutory overnight delivery, return receipt requested, to the most recent address shown in county tax filings and mailed at least 14 days prior to the date of the hearing. 
                  (c)  Nonresidents of this state, whose mailing address is known, shall be served by certified mail or statutory overnight delivery, return receipt requested, mailed at least 14 days prior to the date of the hearing. For nonresidents whose mailing address is unknown, a notice stating the date, time, and place of the hearing shall be published in the newspaper in which the sheriff's advertisements appear in the county once a week for two consecutive weeks prior to the hearing. 
                  (d)  In the event either the owner or any party in interest is a minor, an estate, an incompetent person, or person laboring under disabilities, the guardian or other personal representative of such person shall be served and if such guardian or personal representative resides outside the county or is a nonresident of this state, he or she shall be served as provided for in subsection (c) of this section. If such owner or party in interest has no guardian or personal representative, service shall be perfected by serving the judge of the probate court of the county at least 30 days prior to the date of the hearing which judge shall stand in the place of and protect the rights of such minor, estate, or incompetent person or appoint a guardian ad litem for such person. 
                  (e)  In the event of unknown persons or unborn remaindermen who are likely to have any rights in the property or interest or the proceeds thereof, the judge of the probate court of the county shall be personally served at least 30 days prior to the date of the hearing, and it shall be the duty of the judge of the probate court to stand in the place of and protect the rights of such unknown parties or unborn remaindermen. 
                  (f)  In the event the whereabouts of any owner or party in interest is unknown and the same cannot be ascertained by the public officer in the exercise of reasonable diligence or if any owner or party in interest cannot, after due diligence, be served as provided in this section, the public officer shall make an affidavit to that effect and serve by publication in the manner provided in subsection (c) of this section, and such publication shall be sufficient proof that service was perfected. 
                  (g)  A notice of lis pendens shall be filed in the office of the clerk of superior court of the county at the time of filing the complaint in the municipal court. Such notice shall have the same force and effect as other lis pendens notices provided by law. 
                  (h)  Orders and other filings made subsequent to service of the initial complaint shall be served in the manner provided in this Code section on the owner and any party in interest who answers the complaint or appears at the hearing. Any party who fails to answer or appear at the hearing shall be deemed to have waived all further notice in the proceedings.

In instances where a machine is subject to this division, and is required to have a valid license issued by the state, or any other state, for operation on the public streets of this state, the absence of the required evidence of a valid and current license displayed on the machine shall constitute, for the purposes of this division, a prima facie showing that the machine is in an inoperative state.

                  Sec. 46-59. - Declaration of nuisance.

If such convicted person either fails or refuses to remove the abandoned vehicle from the residential property, or to bring the abandoned vehicle in compliance with the directives of section 46-57, within the ten-day period, the continued presence of the abandoned vehicle on the property shall constitute a separate offense under the provisions of this division.

                  (a)  As provided in O.C.G.A. § 41-2-5 the jurisdiction for the abatement of any nuisance arising out of the existence of an abandoned vehicle located on private property within the city shall be vested in the municipal court. The grant of jurisdiction made in this section is not intended, and shall not be construed to be, a grant to exclude or limit the jurisdiction of any other court of this state vested by the law of this state with jurisdiction over such proceedings. 
                  (b)  Any proceeding to abate a nuisance existing or resulting from an abandoned vehicle in storage on private property within the city shall be commenced by the chief of police of the city in the name and on the behalf of the city, or by a private citizen thereof, by the filing of a petition with the municipal court seeking the abatement thereof. The petition shall identify the property upon which the abandoned vehicle is being maintained, state the name or names of the person in control or possession of the real property, together with a description of the abandoned vehicle alleged to constitute such nuisance, and shall provide sufficient facts so as to inform the court as to the nature of such nuisance. If, upon the filing of such petition, the judge of the court concludes that sufficient facts are alleged to require further inquiry and proceedings as to the existence of a nuisance, an order shall be entered by the court setting a hearing date for the adjudication of the issues raised in the petition. 
                  (c)  The petition to abate the nuisance, together with a copy of the order of the court for hearing thereon, shall be served on the person in possession or control of the real property upon which the nuisance is alleged to exist at least ten days prior to the scheduled hearing date either personally or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. If either the identity or location of such person is unknown, or for whatever reason such person cannot be located for such service, a copy of the petition and the order shall be conspicuously affixed to the abandoned vehicle in a manner so as to provide anyone in its vicinity with notice of the presence of such petition and order. 
                  (d)  At the scheduled hearing the court shall hear the pertinent evidence as to the facts and circumstances surrounding the maintenance of the abandoned vehicle, and shall allow the person or persons in possession or control of the real property to present any relevant and pertinent evidence as to why same does not constitute a nuisance. 
                  (e)  If after hearing the evidence presented at the hearing the court concludes that a nuisance, within the meaning of section 46-59, exists, the court shall enter an order requiring and directing that the abandoned vehicle be removed from the corporate limits of the city within ten days of the date of the order. A copy of the order requiring the abatement of the nuisance shall be served on the person in possession or control of the real property upon which the nuisance is alleged to exist, either personally or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. If either the identity or location of such person is unknown, or for whatever reason the person cannot be located for the purposes of such service, a copy of the order shall 
                  be conspicuously affixed to the abandoned vehicle in a manner so as to provide anyone in its vicinity with notice of the presence of the order. 
                  (f)  If the person in control or possession of the property upon which the abandoned vehicle exists fails to remove same within the ten-day period specified by the court for the abatement of the nuisance, then and in such event the chief of police of the city shall remove, or cause to be removed, the abandoned vehicle from the municipal limits of the city for disposal in such a manner as will terminate the characteristics thereof which resulted in same being found to be a nuisance. The chief of police in the pursuit of his duties to dispose of the abandoned vehicle shall be authorized to sell the abandoned vehicle for junk or metal salvage, and any consideration received for such sale shall be retained by the city to offset the costs and expenses incurred in the abatement of the nuisance.

For secondary trout waters, the buffer zone shall be at least 50 horizontal feet, but the director may grant variances to no less than 25 feet. Regardless of whether a trout stream is primary or secondary, for first order trout waters, which are streams into which no other streams flow except for springs, the buffer shall be at least 25 horizontal feet, and no variance to a smaller buffer shall be granted. The minimum requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b) and the buffer zones provided by this paragraph shall be enforced by the local issuing authority; 
                  (5)  Agricultural operations as defined in O.C.G.A. § 1-3-3, "definitions," to include raising, harvesting or storing of products of the field or orchard; feeding, breeding or managing livestock or poultry; producing or storing feed for use in the production of livestock including, but not limited to, cattle, calves, swine, hogs, goats, sheep, and rabbits or for use in the production of poultry, including but not limited to chickens, hens and turkeys; producing plants, trees, fowl, or animals; the production of aqua culture, horticultural, dairy, livestock, poultry, eggs and apiarian products; farm buildings and farm ponds; 
                  (6)  Forestry land management practices, including harvesting; provided, however, that when such exempt forestry practices cause or result in land-disturbing or other activities otherwise prohibited in a buffer, as established in paragraphs (15) and (16) of subsection 46-98(c) of this article, no other land-disturbing activities, except for normal forest management practices, shall be allowed on the entire property upon which the forestry practices were conducted for a period of three years after completion of such forestry practices; 
                  (7)  Any project carried out under the technical supervision of the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) of the United States Department of Agriculture; 
                  (8)  Any project involving less than one acre of disturbed area; provided, however, that this exemption shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity within a larger common plan of development or sale with a planned disturbance of equal to or greater than one acre or within 200 feet of the bank of any state waters, and for purposes of this paragraph, "state waters" excludes channels and drainage ways which have water in them only during and immediately after rainfall events and intermittent streams which do not have water in them year-round; provided, however, that any person responsible for a project which involves less than one acre, which involves land-disturbing activity, and which is within 200 feet of any such excluded channel or drainage way, must prevent sediment from moving beyond the boundaries of the property on which such project is located and provided, further, that nothing contained herein shall prevent the local issuing authority from regulating any such project which is not specifically exempted by paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9 or 10 of this section; 
                  (9)  Construction or maintenance projects, or both, undertaken or financed in whole or in part, or both, by the department of transportation, the Georgia Highway Authority, or the state road and tollway authority; or any road construction or maintenance project, or both, undertaken by any county or municipality; provided, however, that construction or maintenance projects of the department of transportation or the state road and tollway authority which disturb one or more contiguous acres of land shall be subject to provisions of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7.1; except where the department of transportation, the Georgia Highway Authority, or the state road and tollway authority is a secondary permittee for a project located within a larger common plan of development or sale under the state general permit, in which case a copy of a notice of intent under the state general permit shall be submitted to the local issuing authority, the local issuing authority shall enforce compliance with the minimum requirements set forth in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 as if a permit had been issued, and violations shall be subject to the same penalties as violations by permit holders; 
                  (10)  Any land-disturbing activities conducted by any electric membership corporation or municipal electrical system or any public utility under the regulatory jurisdiction of the public service commission, any utility under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, any cable television system as defined in O.C.G.A. § 36-18-1, or any agency or instrumentality of the United States engaged in the generation, transmission, or distribution of power; except where an electric membership corporation or municipal electrical system or any public utility under the regulatory jurisdiction of the public service commission, any utility under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, any cable television system as defined in O.C.G.A. § 36-18-1, or any agency or instrumentality of the United states engaged in the generation, transmission, or distribution of power is a secondary permittee for a project located within a larger common plan of development or sale under the state general permit, in which case the local issuing authority shall enforce compliance with the minimum requirements set forth in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 as if a permit had been issued, and violations shall be subject to the same penalties as violations by permit holders; and

                  (Ord. No. 1053, § 1, 8-16-11) 
                  Sec. 46-98. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices. 
                  (a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the ordinance and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections 46-98(b) and (c) of this article. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this ordinance and the NPDES general permit. 
                  (b)  Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
                  (1)  Best management practices as set forth in section 46-96 of this article shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act." As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
                  (2)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land-disturbing activities occur. 
                  (5)  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsections 46-98(c)(15) and (16), in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
                  (c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation; which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  (7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection 46-98(b)(2) of this article; 
                  (15)  Except as provided in paragraph (16) of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream: That under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the groundwater table year round; for which groundwater is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow, Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to Part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to article 2 of chapter 5 of title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines. 
                  (d)  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et. seq. shall prevent any Local Issuing Authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections 46-98(b) and (c) of this article. 
                  (e)  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
                  (Ord. No. 1053, § 1, 8-16-11) 
                  Sec. 46-99. - Application/permit process. 
                  (a)  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this ordinance, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
                  (b)  Application requirements. 
                  (1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the City of Thomaston without first obtaining a permit from the building and zoning office to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
                  (2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the building official's office and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection 46-99(c) of this article. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land-disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of subsections 46-98(b) and (c) of this article will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by five copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
                  (3)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to paragraph (9) or (10) of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17 shall be submitted in full to the Division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  (4)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by subsections 46-98(c)(15) and (16) have been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per subsection 46-99(b)(6), have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
                  (5)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this ordinance section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
                  (6)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  (c)  Plan requirements. 
                  (1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in subsections 46-98(b) and (c) of this article, or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this ordinance. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and stormwater management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land-disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
                  (2)  Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
                  (d)  Permits. 
                  (1)  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
                  (2)  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this article, any variances required by subsections 46-98(c)(15) and (16) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per subsection 46-99(b)(6) are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
                  (3)  Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this article, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
                  (4)  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
                  (5)  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this ordinance. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
                  (6)  The LIA may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(f)(1). 
                  (Ord. No. 1053, § 1, 8-16-11) 
                  Sec. 46-100. - Inspection and enforcement. 
                  (a)  The building official's office will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this ordinance, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this ordinance. 
                  (b)  The local issuing authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within 12 months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975. 
                  (c)  The building official's office shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this ordinance, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities. 
                  (d)  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
                  (e)  The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). The district or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
                  (f)  The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within 90 days after notification by the division, the division shall revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority.

                  (1)  Neither the approval of a plan under the provisions of this article, nor the compliance with provisions of this article shall relieve any person from the responsibility for damage to any person or property otherwise imposed by law nor impose any liability upon the local issuing authority or district for damage to any person or property. 
                  (2)  The fact that a land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit.

                  Sec. 54-1. - Authorization. 
                  Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a) of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the mayor and city council, of Thomaston, Georgia, does ordain as follows: 
                  (Ord. No. 1032, § 1, 9-15-09) 
                  Sec. 54-2. - Findings of fact. 
                  (a)  The flood hazard areas of Thomaston, Georgia are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (b)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
                  (Ord. No. 1032, § 1, 9-15-09) 
                  Sec. 54-3. - Statement of purpose. 
                  It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion, and; 
                  (4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; 
                  (5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters. 
                  (Ord. No. 1032, § 1, 9-15-09) 
                  Sec. 54-4. - Objectives.

                  (1)  To protect human life and health; 
                  (2)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
                  (3)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood-blight areas; 
                  (4)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
                  (5)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
                  (6)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; and 
                  (7)  To insure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

                  In ALL areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and/or substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and/or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 54-40(4), "Elevated buildings." 
                  a.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  (2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1—30, AE, or AH zones, may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in subsection 54-32(6). 
                  (3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
                  a.  All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on: (1) individual lots or parcels, (2) in new and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, (3) in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or (4) on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  b.  Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
                  1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or 
                  2.  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
                  c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement (ref. subsection 54-40(6) above). 
                  d.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
                  1.  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; 
                  2.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions); or 
                  3.  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "new construction," including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsection 54-41(3)a. [and] c., above. 
                  (4)  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 54-11, are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
                  b.  ONLY if subsection 54-41(4)a. above is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of article IV.

                  (a)  The board of adjustments and appeals as established by city shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this chapter. 
                  (b)  The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. 
                  (c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the board of adjustments and appeals may appeal such decision to the Superior Court of Upson County, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1. 
                  (d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if ANY increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (g)  In reviewing such requests, the board of adjustments and appeals shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this chapter.

                  Sec. 54-61. - Conditions for variances. 
                  (a)  A variance shall be issued ONLY when there is: 
                  (1)  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
                  (2)  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  (3)  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  (b)  The provisions of this chapter are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of a historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (c)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (d)  The floodplain administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (e)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this chapter, the board of adjustments and appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

                  (3)  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and 
                  (4)  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
                  Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. (Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. NOTE: Accessory structures are NOT exempt from any chapter requirements). For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above-ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
                  Subdivision means the division of a single lot into two or more lots for the purpose of sale or development. 
                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
                  Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the "start of construction" of the improvement. NOTE: The market value of the structure should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
                  For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include (1) those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project, or (2) any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure". 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. 
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  Sec. 68-1. - Purpose and findings. 
                  (a)  Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate sexually oriented businesses and related activities in order to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of the city, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of sexually oriented businesses within the city. The provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials that is protected by the Constitution. Neither is it the intent nor the effect of this chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene materials. 
                  (b)  Findings. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses on a community presented in a hearing, and in reports made available to the mayor and council, and on findings incorporated in the cases of City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986); Young v. American Mini Theatres, 427 U.S. 50 (1976); and Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (199 1); Arcara v. Cloud Books, Inc., 478 U.S. 697, (1986); California v. LaRue, 409 U.S. 109 (1972); Iacobucci v. City of Newport, Ky, 479 U.S. 92 (1986); United States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367 (1968); DLS, Inc. v. City of Chattanooga, 107 F.3d 403 (6th Cir. 1997); Kev, Inc. v. Kitsap County, 793 F.2d 1053 (9th Cir. 1986); Hang On, Inc. v. City of Arlington, 65 F.3d 1248 (5th Cir. 1995); and South Florida Free Beaches, Inc. v. City of Miami, 734 F.2d 608 (11th Cir. 1984), as well as studies conducted in other cities including, but not limited to, Garden Grove, California; Tucson, AZ; Seattle, Washington; Austin, Texas; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Indianapolis, Indiana; Houston, Texas; Beaumont, Texas; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Phoenix, Arizona; Whittier, California; Amarillo, Texas; Cleveland, Ohio; and Los Angeles, California; findings reported in the Final Report of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986), the Report of the Attorney General's Working Group On the Regulation Of Sexually Oriented Business (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota), and statistics obtained from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the mayor and city council find that: 
                  (1)  Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are historically uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments. Further, there is presently no mechanism to make owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that are likely to occur on their premises. 
                  (2)  Crime statistics show that all types of crimes, especially sex-related crimes, occur with more frequency in neighborhoods where sexually oriented businesses are located. See, e.g., studies of the cities of Phoenix, Arizona; Indianapolis, Indiana; and Austin, Texas. 
                  (3)  Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur at sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live sex shows. See, e.g., California v. LaRue, 409 U.S. 109, 111 (1972); See also Final Report of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986) at 377. 
                  (4)  Offering and providing such booths and/or cubicles encourages such activities, which creates unhealthy conditions. See, e.g., Final Report of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986) at 376-77. 
                  (5)  Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades, and other sexually oriented businesses, for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses. See, e.g., Arcara v. Cloud Books, Inc., 478 U.S. 697, 698 (1986); see also Final Report of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986) at 376-77. 
                  (6)  At least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses including, but not limited to, syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital herpes, hepatitis B, Non A, Non B amebiasis, salmonella infections, and shigella infections. See, e.g., Study of Fort Myers, Florida. 
                  (7)  For the period 1985 through 1995, the total number of reported cases of AIDS in the United States caused by the immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was 523,056. See, e.g., Statistics of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
                  (8)  As of December 1998, there have been 17,860 reported cases of AIDS in the state, and there were 15 cases reported in the county in 1999. 
                  (9)  Since 1981 and to the present, there has been an increasing cumulative number of persons testing positive for HIV antibody test in the state. 
                  (10)  The total number of cases of early (less than one year) syphilis in the United States reported during the ten-year period 1985—1995 was 367,796. See e.g., Statistics of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
                  (11)  The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States reported annually remains at a high level, with a total of 1,250,581 cases reported during the period 1993-1995. See, e.g. Statistics of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
                  (12)  The surgeon general of the United States in his report of October 22, 1986, advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug use, exposure to infected blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her newborn. 
                  (13)  According to the best scientific evidence available, AIDS and HIV infection, as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts. See, e.g. Findings of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
                  (14)  Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and, in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate those activities and maintain those facilities. See, e.g., Final Report of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986) at 3 77. 
                  (15)  Numerous studies and reports have determined that bodily fluids, including semen and urine, are found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view "adult" oriented films. See, e.g., Final Report of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986) at 377. 
                  (16)  The findings noted in paragraphs numbered (1) through (15) raise substantial governmental concerns. 
                  (17)  Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns. 
                  (18)  A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of sexually oriented businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will place an incentive on operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health, safety, and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the city. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business, fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein. 
                  (19)  Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on the premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity that occurs in adult establishments. 
                  (20)  The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of a sexually oriented business, where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and criminal activity. 
                  (21)  It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees of sexually oriented businesses, particularly the criminal history of such person, and to have information as to those who are likely to be witnesses to activity proscribed by this chapter. 
                  (22)  The fact that an applicant for a sexually oriented business license has been convicted of a sex-related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this chapter and the general laws governing such conduct. 
                  (23)  The barring of such individuals from operation or employment in sexually oriented businesses for a period of ten (10) years for a previous felony conviction serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases. 
                  (24)  The general welfare, health, morals, and safety of the citizens of this city will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter.

                  Sec. 74-31. - Council approval and ordinance compliance required. 
                  No bridge or other structure, referred to in this article as "bridge," shall be permitted to be erected across any public street or public alley of the city for any purpose, except upon the approval and authorization of the council by special ordinance, and upon compliance with all applicable ordinances of the city, including the provisions of this article, as follows: 
                  (1)  No supports for a bridge or any other obstructions shall be placed in the street or public alley right-of-way or on that portion of the street or public alley set aside for or used as a sidewalk. 
                  (2)  The minimum height above street level, and the maximum outside dimensions, both height and width, of the bridge shall be fixed by the council, as to each bridge permitted by it, which requirements shall be set forth in the special ordinance permitting the erection of each bridge. 
                  (3)  The bridge shall be designed by an architect or an engineer licensed to practice in the state, and the plans and specifications for the bridge presented to the city for approval shall bear his official registration seal thereon. Such plans and specifications shall be submitted to the city manager, who shall present the same to the mayor and council, together with his recommendations relative thereto. 
                  (4)  If the council grants a party the right to construct a bridge, the construction, maintenance and removal of the bridge shall be at the sole expense of such party. The special ordinance granting permission to erect any particular bridge shall constitute a contract between the city and such party wherein such party shall agree with the city to modify the bridge at any time, and from time to time, if the city reasonably determines that such modifications are necessary in order to ensure the continued safety of the public. 
                  (5)  No advertising or mercantile displays shall be permitted within, upon or attached to the bridge, and no sales of merchandise shall be permitted within the bridge. 
                  (6)  The outside appearance of the bridge shall not detract from the adjoining buildings or the neighborhood, and no articles of any nature, other than lighting fixtures, shall be permitted to be suspended from the outside of the bridge. 
                  (7)  Not more than one bridge shall be permitted to cross the same street or alley within a block created by intersecting streets or public alleys, with the exception that two or more bridges may be permitted when constructed above or below an existing bridge with the sides of the bridges in the same vertical planes. 
                  (Code 1965, § 27-15) 
                  Sec. 74-32. - City's right to require removal; notice; hearing. 
                  The right granted to a party to erect a bridge across a public street or alley shall be subject to the condition that the city shall have the right to require the removal of the bridge if it becomes detrimental to the public health or safety, or if, after the granting of permission to erect the bridge over a particular street or alley, changes occur relative to the public use of the street or alley so that the bridge constitutes a hindrance to the public use of such street or alley. If the city makes a preliminary determination that the bridge constitutes a hazard to the public health or safety, or that the bridge has become a detriment to the use by the public of the street or alley, the city shall notify the owner of the bridge of such preliminary determination, together with a reasonable explanation of the facts upon which the determination was made, and shall offer the owner of the bridge a hearing on a date specified in the notice, before the mayor and council, within not less than 15 days nor more than 45 days following the receipt of the notice. If the owner desires a hearing, the city manager shall present the facts from which the preliminary determination was made, and the owner of the bridge shall be permitted to present any contrary contentions, or any proposals to remedy the findings of the city manager. The mayor and council, following the hearing, shall make a finding as to whether the preliminary determination was correct, and if so, whether the same can be remedied. If a determination is made that a remedy exists so that the public health or safety will be properly protected, or so that the use of the street or alley by the public can be maintained, and the owner is willing to undertake and carry out such remedy within a time frame fixed by mayor and council, then the owner shall be required to agree to do so in writing. If the owner fails, within the time allowed, or any extensions, to implement the changes found to be necessary to provide a proper remedy, the owner shall be so notified, whereupon the owner shall be obligated to remove the bridge within 90 days of such notice.

                  Sec. 74-33. - Bond. 
                  In each instance where the council grants permission to erect a bridge, the council may, in the special ordinance relative thereto, condition the granting of such permission upon the agreement by the owners of the affected property, the lessors or lessees thereof, if any, or any combination of the foregoing to furnish and maintain a bond, at no expense to the city, with a corporate surety satisfactory to the city to guarantee the performance of the principal in removing the bridge, as provided in section 74-32.

                  Permission to erect a bridge across a street or public alley of the city shall be contingent upon the agreement of the owner or lessors, if any, of the buildings between which the bridge is erected, or any one or all of the foregoing, to hold the city harmless from any and all claims arising out of the construction, operation, use, maintenance or removal of the bridge, unless such claim arose from the sole negligence of the city, and upon the agreement of the owner or lessors, if any, or any one or all of the foregoing, to furnish a policy of public liability insurance satisfactory to the city, or at the option of the city, a certificate evidencing such insurance, and naming the city as an additional named insured, in an amount approved by the council.

                  Sec. 74-35. - Maintenance obligations. 
                  The special ordinance granting permission to erect any bridge shall impose a continuing obligation upon the owner of the properties affected as well as the user of the bridge to continuously maintain the bridge in a safe condition, which duty shall not be diminished by the city's initial approval of the plans and specifications for such bridge, nor by the failure of the city, from time to time, to require modifications to such bridge, and the indemnification obligation provided for in section 74-34 shall not be diminished by any such approval on behalf of the city, nor by any failure of the city to require any modifications in such bridge subsequent to the initial approval thereof.

                  Sec. 74-36. - Identification of parties to installation request. 
                  Each request for permission to erect a bridge shall be accompanied by a title certificate of an attorney authorized to practice law in the state setting forth the names and address of the owners of the buildings to be connected by the bridge and the names and addresses of the lessors and lessees of the buildings, together with information as to the terms of any leases of the buildings, the corporate names of any parties, sufficient to accurately disclose the names of all parties required in the agreement between the city and the parties desiring to erect the bridge which agreement shall be the special authorizing ordinance and shall be executed by all the parties prior to the issuance of any building permit for the construction of the bridge.

                  Permission to erect and maintain a bridge across any street or public alley in the city shall be contingent upon the owners or lessees of the buildings between which the bridge is erected paying to the city an annual rental for the air space occupied by the bridge at a rate determined by the council, based on the outside dimensions of the bridge, which rate per cubic foot shall be subject to change from time to time by ordinance.

                  (c)  If, in the opinion of the chief of police, the parade or assembly will require the diversion of too great a number of police officers of the city to properly police the parade or assembly so as to prevent normal police protection to the city; the concentration of persons or other units of such parade at its assembly point, or the concentration of persons at such assembly, will unduly interfere with the proper fire and police protection and ambulance service to areas contiguous to such parade or assembly; or the conduct of the parade or assembly is reasonably likely to cause injury to persons or property, to produce disorderly conduct or to create a 
                  disturbance, the chief of police shall notify the city clerk of his decision to disapprove the application for a parade or assembly permit and shall include the specific reason for his decision.

                  Sec. 74-81. - Utility registration. 
                  (a)  Registration required. Each utility who occupies, uses or has facilities in the rights-of-way at the time of passage of this article, including by lease, sublease or assignment, to operate facilities located in the rights-of-way, unless specifically exempted by state or federal law or this Code, shall file a registration statement with the department within 90 days of the effective date of this article. 
                  (b)  Registration procedure. The registration information provided to the city shall be on a form approved by the city and include, but not be limited to: 
                  (1)  The name, legal status (i.e. partnership, corporation, etc.), street address, email address, and telephone and facsimile numbers of the utility filing the registration statement (the "registrant"). If the registrant is not the owner of the facility in the right-of-way, the registration shall include the name, street address, email address if applicable, and telephone and facsimile numbers of the owner. 
                  (2)  The name, street address, email address if applicable and telephone and facsimile numbers of one (1) or more facilities representative(s).

                  (d)  Effect of acceptance of registration. Acceptance of the registration shall not convey title in the rights-of-way. Acceptance of the registration is only the nonexclusive, limited right to occupy rights-of-way in the city for the limited purposes stated in the acceptance. Acceptance of the registration does not excuse a utility from obtaining permits required by city ordinances nor from obtaining appropriate access or pole attachment agreements before using the facilities of others, including the city. Acceptance of the registration does not excuse a utility from notifying the city of construction as required herein.

Beginning one year after the effective date of this chapter, any facilities or part of a facility found in a right-of-way for which registration is required but has not been obtained unless specifically exempted by law, and for which no valid service agreement exists with the city, may be deemed to be a nuisance and an unauthorized use of the rights-of-way. The city may exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in equity, including, but not limited to abating the nuisance; taking possession of the facilities, evicting the utility from the right-of-way; prosecuting the violator; and/or any other remedy provided by city ordinance or otherwise allowed in law or in equity.

                  (1)  Each utility shall, as soon as reasonably practicable, notify the director of any event regarding its facilities which it considers to be an emergency. The utility may proceed to take whatever actions are necessary in order to respond to the emergency. A utility who engages in an emergency excavation shall take all reasonable precautions to avoid or minimize damage to any existing facilities. 
                  (2)  In the event that the city becomes aware of an emergency regarding utility facilities, the city may attempt to contact the affected utility or facilities representative. The city may take whatever action it deems necessary in order to respond to the emergency, including cut or move any of the wires, cables, amplifiers, appliances, or other parts of the facilities. The city shall not incur any liability to the utility, for such emergency actions, and the cost of such shall be paid by each utility affected by the emergency. 
                  (f)  Effective period of permit. 
                  (1)  Each permit shall have a set commencement and expiration date based on information provided in the applicant's permit application.

If the director decides there is cause or reason to terminate, the following procedure shall be followed: 
                  (1)  City shall serve a utility with a written notice of the reason or cause for proposed termination and shall allow a utility a minimum of 15 calendar days to cure its breach. 
                  (2)  If the utility fails to cure within 15 calendar days, the city may declare the permit terminated.

                  (b)  Protection of traffic and roadway. Unless specifically in the permit, no utility may occupy the city rights-of-way unless sufficient space is available so that the free flow and safety of traffic and other capacity considerations are not unduly impaired and the installation does not prevent the department from reasonably maintaining the streets, structures, traffic control devices and other appurtenant facilities, and further provided that maintenance and operations of the facilities do not jeopardize the traffic, street structure, other users of the right-of-way or the right-of-way itself. 
                  (c)  Grading.

In the event the utility refuses or neglects to so protect, alter, or relocate all or part of the facilities, the city shall have the right to break through, remove, alter, or relocated all or any part of the facilities without any liability to the utility and the utility shall pay to the city the costs incurred in connection with such breaking through, removal, alteration, or relocation. 
                  (d)  Installation of poles and other wire holding structures and relocation. Unless otherwise provided in a valid service agreement, no placement of any pole or wire holding structure of the utility is to be considered a vested interest in the right-of-way, and such poles or structures are to be removed, relocated underground, or modified by the utility at its own expense whenever the city determines that the public convenience would be enhanced thereby. The facilities shall be so located and installed as to cause minimum interference with the rights and convenience of property owners. 
                  (e)  Notice of blasting excavating. As provided in O.C.G.A § 25-9-6 (the Georgia Utility Facility Protection Act) and other applicable state law currently in place or as amended, no utility shall commence, perform, or engage in blasting or in excavating with mechanized excavating facilities unless and until the utility planning the blasting or excavating has given 48 hours' notice by submitting a locate request to the utility protection center, beginning the next working day after such notice is provided, excluding hours during days other than working days.

                  (b)  Stop work orders. At any time, including the time of inspection, the director may order the immediate cessation of any work which poses a serious threat to the health, safety, or welfare of the public, violates any law, or which violates the terms and conditions of the permit and/or this chapter or issue an order to correct work which does not conform to the permit and/or applicable standards, conditions or codes. 
                  (c)  Notice upon completion. When the construction under any permit is completed, the utility shall notify the department.

                  Sec. 74-88. - Other provisions. 
                  (a)  Severability. If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or portion of this chapter is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional by any court or administrative agency of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct and independent provision and such holding shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions thereof. 
                  (b)  Reservation of regulatory and police powers.

The utility by applying for and being issued a written permit, is deemed to acknowledge that all lawful powers and rights, regulatory power, or police power, or otherwise as are or the same may be from time to time vested in or reserved to the city, shall be in full force and effect and subject to the exercise thereof by the city at any time. A utility is deemed to acknowledge that its interests are subject to the regulatory and police powers of the city to adopt and enforce general ordinances necessary to the safety and welfare of the public and is deemed to agree to comply with all applicable general laws enacted by the city pursuant to such powers. In particular, all utilities shall comply with city zoning and other land use requirements pertaining to the placement and specifications of facilities. 
                  (c)  Compliance. No person shall be relieved of its obligation to comply with any of the provisions of this chapter by reason of any failure of city to enforce compliance.

                  (1)  Additionally, the following materials and methods shall apply to building sewers within city supervision: 
                  a.  The building sewer shall be cast iron soil pipe, ASTM Specification A74, latest revision, or equal; ductile iron pipe, American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Specification A21.51, latest revision, or equal; or polyvinyl chloride (PVC) sewer pipe, ASTM Specification D3034, latest revision. All joints shall be tight and waterproof. 
                  b.  Any part of the building sewer that is located within ten feet of a water service pipe shall be constructed of cast iron soil pipe or ductile iron pipe, and bolted mechanical joints may be required by the superintendent where the sewer is exposed to damage by tree roots. If installed in filled or unstable ground, the building sewer shall be of cast iron soil pipe, except that plastic pipe may be acceptable if laid on a suitable concrete bed or cradle as approved by the superintendent. 
                  c.  The size and slope of the building sewer shall be subject to the approval of the superintendent, but in no event shall the diameter be less than four inches. The slope of such four inch pipe shall not be less than 1/8 inch per foot. Furthermore, the appropriate requirements of the Occupational Health and Safety Act (OSHA) shall be followed. 
                  d.  The depth shall be sufficient to afford protection from frost, and the building sewer shall be laid at uniform grade and with straight alignment insofar as possible. Changes in direction shall be made only with properly curved pipe and fittings. Building sewers shall not be placed in the same trench with water service lines. 
                  e.  Any excavation required for the installation of a building sewer shall be open trench work unless otherwise approved by the superintendent. Pipe laying and backfill shall be performed in accordance with ASTM Specification C12, latest revision, except that no backfill shall be placed until the work has been inspected and approved. 
                  f.  All joints and connections shall be made gastight and watertight. 
                  g.  Push-on joints for cast iron soil pipe shall have neoprene gaskets in accordance with the requirements of ASTM C-564. 
                  h.  Push-on joints for ductile iron pipe shall also have neoprene gaskets and be installed according to the manufacturer's recommendations. 
                  i.  PVC pipe joint material shall be of the bell and sealed with a rubber "O"-ring gasket, having a composition and texture which is resistant to the common ingredients of sewage, industrial wasted (including oils), and groundwater, and which will endure permanently under the conditions likely to be imposed by this use. Installation of gasket shall be done in accordance with the pipe manufacturer's instructions using all the necessary materials, lubricants, and equipment recommended by the manufacturer. Other jointing materials may be used only when approved by the superintendent. 
                  j.  The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall be made at the "Y" branch, if such a branch is available at a suitable location. If the public sewer is 12 inches in diameter or less, and no properly located "Y" branch is available, the city shall, at the owner's expense, cut a neat hole into the public sewer, with entry in the downstream direction at an angle of about 45 degrees, and install a 45 degree elbow with the spigot end cut so as not to extend past the inner surface of the public sewer. The invert of the building sewer at the point of connection shall be at an elevation of at least 0.1 foot above the invert of the public sewer. A neat smooth joint shall be made, and the connection made secure and watertight by encasement in concrete. Special fittings may be used for the connection only when approved by the superintendent. 
                  k.  Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the building at an elevation below the basement floor. No building sewer shall be laid parallel to or within three feet of any bearing wall which might thereby be weakened. In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such building drain shall be lifted by an approved means and discharged to the building sewer. 
                  l.  No person shall make connection of roof down spouts, foundation drains, areaway drains, or other sources of surface runoff or groundwater to a building sewer or building drain which in turn is connected directly or indirectly to a public sanitary sewer unless such connection is approved by the superintendent for purposes of disposal of polluted surface drainage. 
                  m.  The location of any sewer installation shall be adequately guarded with barricades and lights so as to protect the public from hazard. Streets, sidewalks, parkways, and other public property disturbed in the course of work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the city. 
                  n.  The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall conform to the requirements of the building and plumbing code or other applicable rules and regulations of the city or the procedures set forth in appropriate specifications of the ASTM and the WPCF Manual of Practice No. 9. All such connections shall be made gastight and watertight and verified by proper testing. Any deviation from the prescribed procedures and materials must be approved by the superintendent before installation. 
                  o.  If any house sewer permits the entrance of infiltration or inflow, the city may: 
                  1.  Require the owner to repair the house sewer. 
                  2.  Charge the owner a sewer rate that reflects the costs of the additional expense of sewage treatment from the owner's property. 
                  3.  Require the owner to disconnect his sewer from the city sewer system.

                  Sec. 90-87. - Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste. 
                  (a)  Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA regional wastes management division director, and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the waste stream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste stream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this paragraph need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under section 90-83 of this division. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of sections 90-79, 90-81 and 90-82. 
                  (b)  Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of paragraph a, above, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous washes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a onetime notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
                  (c)  In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the superintendent, the EPA regional waste management waste division director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations. 
                  (d)  In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
                  (e)  This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this division, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.

                  The superintendent shall have the right to enter the premises of any user to determine whether the user is complying with all requirements of this chapter and any wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder. Users shall allow the superintendent ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties imposed upon him under this chapter. 
                  (1)  Where a user has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, the superintendent will be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities. 
                  (2)  The superintendent shall have the right to set up on the user's property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's operations, including the right to require the user to install a sampling manhole. 
                  (3)  The superintendent may require the user to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated annually to ensure their accuracy. 
                  (4)  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user at the written or verbal request of the superintendent and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be born by the user. 
                  (5)  Unreasonable delays in allowing the superintendent access to the premises shall be a violation of this division.

                  Sec. 90-96. - Administrative enforcement remedies; notification of violation. 
                  When the superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the superintendent may serve upon that user a written notice of violation. Within ten days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the superintendent. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the superintendent to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation.

                  Sec. 90-97. - Consent orders. 
                  The superintendent may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to sections 90-99 and 90-100 and shall be judicially enforceable.

                  Sec. 90-98. - Show cause hearing. 
                  The superintendent may order a user which has violated, or continues to violate, any provisions of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the superintendent and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least 15 days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.

                  Sec. 90-99. - Compliance orders. 
                  When the superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this division, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the superintendent may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.

                  Sec. 90-100. - Cease and desist orders. 
                  When the superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the superintendent may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to: 
                  (1)  Immediately comply with all requirements; and 
                  (2)  Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating discharge. 
                  Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
                  (Ord. No. 1026, § 2, 3-3-09) 
                  Sec. 90-101. - Administrative fines. 
                  (a)  When the superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the superintendent may fine such user in an amount not to exceed $1,000.00. Such fines shall be assessed on a per violation, per day basis. In the case of monthly or other long term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation. 
                  (b)  Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after ten calendar days, be assessed an additional penalty of five percent of the unpaid balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of percent per month. A lien against the user's property will be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties. 
                  (c)  Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for the superintendent to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount within ten days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit, the superintendent may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event the user's appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user. The superintendent may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine. 
                  (d)  Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for taking any other action against the user.

                  Sec. 90-102. - Emergency suspensions. 
                  The superintendent may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The superintendent may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment. 
                  (1)  Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the superintendent may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The superintendent may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the superintendent that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in section 90-108 are initiated against the user. 
                  (2)  A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the superintendent prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under section 90-98 or 90-108. 
                  Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section. 
                  (Ord. No. 1026, § 2, 3-3-09) 
                  Sec. 90-103. - Termination of discharge. 
                  In addition to the provisions in section 90-76, any user who violates the following conditions is subject to discharge termination: 
                  (1)  Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions; 
                  (2)  Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge; 
                  (3)  Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge; 
                  (4)  Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or 
                  (5)  Violation of the pretreatment standards in sections 90-56, 90-57 and 90-58. 
                  Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under section 90-98 why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the superintendent shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.

                  Sec. 90-104. - Injunctive relief. 
                  When the superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the superintendent may petition the superior court through the city's attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this chapter on activities or the user. The superintendent may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. 
                  (Ord. No. 1026, § 2, 3-3-09) 
                  Sec. 90-105. - Civil penalties. 
                  (a)  A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this division, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the city for a maximum civil penalty of $1,000.00 per violation, per day. In the case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation. 
                  (b)  The city may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the city. 
                  (c)  In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice requires. 
                  (d)  Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.

                  The remedies provided for in this chapter are not exclusive. The superintendent may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the city's enforcement response plan. However, the superintendent may take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the superintendent is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user.

                  Sec. 90-113. - Affirmative defenses to discharge violations; upset. 
                  (a)  For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
                  (b)  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of paragraph (c), below, are met. 
                  (c)  A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
                  (1)  An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset; 
                  (2)  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 
                  (3)  The user has submitted the following information to the superintendent within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days): 
                  a.  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
                  b.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
                  c.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent an upset. 
                  (d)  In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
                  (e)  Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
                  (f)  Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails.

                  Sec. 90-114. - Prohibited discharges standards. 
                  A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in section 90-55(a) or the specific prohibitions in subsections 90-55(b) through 90-58 if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either: 
                  (1)  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interferences; or 
                  (2)  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements. 
                  (Ord. No. 1026, § 2, 3-3-09) 
                  Sec. 90-115. - Bypass. 
                  (a)  For the purposes of this section: 
                  (1)  Bypass means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a user's treatment facility. 
                  (2)  Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
                  (b)  A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. 
                  (c)  If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the superintendent, at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
                  (d)  A user shall submit oral notice to the superintendent of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The superintendent may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours. 
                  (e)  Bypass is prohibited, and the superintendent may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless 
                  (1)  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
                  (2)  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
                  (3)  The user submitted notices as required under paragraph (c) of this section. 
                  (f)  The superintendent may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the superintendent determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in paragraph (e) of this section.

The city will only compensate customer for avoided energy kwh's as determined by metered energy delivered to the city's distribution system. 
                  b.  The customer's net bill will be calculated using the city calculation for avoided energy cost (as described below) credited to the customer, netted against the billing period charges for the customer's regular service (according to the applicable tariff) based on actual metered energy. 
                  (3)  Avoided energy cost. Payments by the city to the customer for the billing period metered avoided energy kWh's will be computed by the city in its sole discretion based on the average monthly wholesale market price as determined by the Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia (MEAG Power), the city's wholesale energy provider. 
                  In the event customer develops a credit balance during a billing period, the amount will remain as a credit on the customer's account. Credit balances remaining at the end of the city's fiscal year will be cleared by the issuance of a check for the credit balance to customer. Any other clearance of account credit balances will be at the city's discretion. 
                  (e)  Safety, power quality, and interconnection requirements. The customer shall be responsible for ensuring a safe and reliable interconnection with the city and all costs incurred therein. The city has available, upon request, the following documents that must be completed and approved in their entirety prior to interconnection by the customer to the city's distribution system: 
                  (1)  Application for interconnection of distributed generation facility; 
                  (2)  Interconnection agreement; 
                  (3)  Electrical power exchange agreement. 
                  The provisions in all documents outlined above are incorporated into this tariff in their entirety. For the avoidance of doubt, customer shall be deemed to have agreed to such provisions by applying for service under this tariff. 
                  The city will only be required to purchase energy from eligible distributed generation facilities on a first-come, first-served basis until the cumulative generating capacity of all renewable energy sources from all customers equals the percentage of the city's annual peak demand in the previous year as set forth in O.C.G.A. § 46-3-56(a). Additional energy may be purchased by the city at its sole discretion at a cost agreed to by it and the customer provider. The city shall at no time be required to purchase energy from customers in excess of amounts required by the DG Act. 
                  The city reserves the right to separate the customer generator's equipment from city lines and facilities when, in the city's judgment, the continued parallel operation is unsafe or may cause damage to persons or property. Upon such separation, the city shall promptly notify the customer generator so that any unsafe condition can be corrected.

                  (a)  The city clerk of the city shall cause readings to be made by the designated employees of said city for all electric and water meters measuring consumption of such utility services provided by the city on at least a monthly basis. From the information provided by said meter readings the city clerk shall determine the quantities of water and electrical energy which have been supplied through each such meter since the previous readings, shall calculate therefrom the amounts due the city for such water, electrical and sewer services for the current billing cycle and shall add thereto the sanitary tax to which each user is subject. The city clerk shall, on or before the first day of each calendar month, prepare statements for the most recent meter reading cycle showing the amount of the charges imposed by the city for such water, electricity, sewer services and sanitary tax for each consumer of such services, and shall mail such statements to each such consumer. All bills for such utility services shall be due and payable without penalty by the final date for payment reflected thereon, and each such statement shall further reflect a service discontinuation date, all as shall be established by the city clerk for each such billing cycle. The final date for the payment of such utility services without penalty shall not be less than 15 days from the date of the mailing of such statement, and the service discontinuation date shall not be less than 16 days from the date of mailing such statement. 
                  The bills for utility services shall clearly state in bold print the final date for payment of the bill without penalty, and shall further notify the consumers of such services that: 
                  (1)  If payment for such services is not received by the final date for payment, an additional service charge will be imposed on the consumer. 
                  (2)  A customer service representative of the city is available during normal business hours to answer questions, address complaints and objections, and to correct any errors on the bills. 
                  (3)  The bill is the only notice which will be provided as to the charges shown, and if full payment, together with any service charges due, is not made by the service discontinuation date shown on the bill, the utility services to the served premises will be discontinued and will only be reconnected when full payment plus reconnection charges have been paid. 
                  The mayor and council shall from time to time establish by resolution a schedule of service charges to be imposed for any utility bills not paid on a timely basis, and the fees for the services provided by the city to reconnect utility services that have been discontinued because of nonpayment. 
                  (b)  Every person who receives any services from the city for which a charge is imposed by the city shall be liable therefor at the rate of charge then in effect. 
                  (c)  When a city customer desires to discontinue receiving such utility or other services, such customer shall file a written request for the termination of such services with the city. Each customer that applies for utility or other services from the city shall be liable for all charges for such services provided to the location for which such services are requested until such customer has filed a written request with the city that such services be terminated and such services have been terminated pursuant to such written request.

                  The mayor and council shall from time to time establish by resolution a schedule of security deposits to be procured by the city clerk from consumers of city utility services, to be maintained and held by the city clerk to insure the payment of all charges due for the furnishing of said services. The security deposit schedules so established from time to time shall be applicable to services to be initiated after the effective date thereof, and shall not be construed to require any additional deposits for services already then in existence. The amount of said deposit shall not be utilized or applied to billings for services made during the continuation of such services, but shall be refunded to the consumer upon the discontinuation of such utility services and after the payment in full of all charges due the city therefor. 
                  In dealing with such security deposits the city clerk shall be authorized in his or her discretion: 
                  (1)  To accept in lieu of a cash deposit from a renter or lessee of a single-family residential premises seeking utility services a written guaranty of payment to the city for all utility services provided said premises when duly executed and delivered by the then record owner or owners of subject premises with a satisfactory credit history with the city. The written guaranty shall be in form and content satisfactory to the city clerk and shall specifically provide that the city shall not be required to restore any further utility services to said premises after any discontinuation thereof until all amounts due for such services as covered by said written guaranty are fully paid. Further, said written guaranty shall provide that in addition to the right of the city to discontinue further utility services, any unpaid charges shall be a lien on said real property, and if collection of such unpaid charges cannot be effectuated by the discontinuation of such services, the city clerk shall be authorized to issue executions against the real estate so served, with such executions to be enforced in the same manner as city taxes. 
                  (2)  Homeowners or building owners will not have to pay a deposit if they present proof of ownership of the premises to be served, and have good credit history with the city, or their most recent utility supplier. The term "good credit history" shall mean at least 18 months of timely payment of such person's utility account, without any late payment being assessed.

If, in his or her discretion, such employee determines that identity theft or attempted identity theft is likely or probable, such employee shall immediately report such red flags to the city clerk. If, in his or her discretion, such employee deems that identity theft is unlikely or that reliable information is available to reconcile red flags, the employee shall convey this information to the city clerk, who may in his or her discretion determine that no further action is necessary.

                  (5)  Notify law enforcement, in the event that someone other than the customer has accessed the customer's account causing additional charges to accrue or accessing personal identifying information; or 
                  (6)  Take other appropriate action to prevent or mitigate identity theft. 
                  (b)  In the event that any city employee responsible for or involved in opening a new covered account becomes aware of red flags indicating possible identity theft with respect an application for a new account, such employee shall use his or her discretion to determine whether such red flag or combination of red flags suggests a threat of identity theft. If, in his or her discretion, such employee determines that identity theft or attempted identity theft is likely or probable, such employee shall immediately report such red flags to the city clerk. If, in his or her discretion, such employee deems that identity theft is unlikely or that reliable information is available to reconcile red flags, the employee shall convey this information to the city clerk, who may in his or her discretion determine that no further action is necessary.

                  (8)  No use not specifically allowed in this section for property in this P-1 professional-institutional district shall be made of any such property, and any use not thus specifically allowed shall be and hereby is specifically prohibited. 
                  (c)  Signs. Signs shall be permitted as follows: 
                  (1)  One professional or announcement sign per lot for customary home occupations.

                  (1)  Principal use. No principal use shall be initiated or continued unless there shall be provided therewith the following number of parking spaces: 
                  a.  Hospitals, nursing homes or similar institutions: One space (off-street) for each two beds, plus one space for each staff or visiting doctor and one space for each three employees. 
                  b.  Dwelling units: Two off-street spaces for each dwelling unit. 
                  c.  Medical, dental and health offices and clinics: One off-street space for each 150 square feet of floor space.

                  e.  Places of public assembly: One space for each four seats in the principal room. 
                  (2)  Location of parking space on the property. If the required automobile parking spaces cannot be reasonably provided on the same lot on which the principal use is conducted, such spaces may be provided on other off-street property, provided such property lies within 300 feet of the main entrance to such principal use. Such automobile parking shall be legally associated with the principal use and shall not thereafter be reduced or encroached upon in any manner, except that another parking area which meets the requirements of this article may be substituted therefor. 
                  (3)  Size of parking spaces. All of the automobile parking spaces shall not be less than nine feet × 19 feet, or 171 square feet and such standing space shall be improved and be accessible to a paved street or alley, and convenient entry to and from such paved street or alley to and from each of the parking areas must be provided. Turning space shall be provided, except for single-family residences, so that no vehicle shall be required to back into a street. 
                  (4)  Extension of parking space into a residential district. Required parking space may extend up to 100 feet into a residential zoning district provided that: 
                  a.  The parking space adjoins a professional district; 
                  b.  Such spaces have access to or front upon the same street as the property in the professional district for which it provides the required parking space; and 
                  c.  That it is visually separated from abutting properties in the adjoining residential district by suitable screening devices or materials approved in advance by the building inspector. 
                  (e)  Lot area. Lot area requirements shall be the same as those requirements for a C-1 main commercial district with the exception that where the professional district adjoins a residential district no building shall be permitted within 25 feet of any residential district line except where such district line is a street, in which case the minimum setback from the centerline of the street shall be 50 feet. 
                  (f)  Height. No building in any professional district shall exceed two stories or 35 feet in height without approval of the board of zoning appeals.

                  Sec. 98-48. - PUD planned unit development district. 
                  (a)  Purpose. PUD planned unit development districts are intended to: 
                  (1)  Encourage the development of large tracts of land as planned neighborhoods or communities. 
                  (2)  Encourage flexible and creative concepts in site planning. 
                  (3)  Preserve the natural amenities of the land by encouraging scenic and functional open areas within residential areas. 
                  (4)  Create a more desirable environment than would be possible through the strict application of minimum requirements of other sections of this chapter. 
                  (5)  Provide for efficient use of land resulting in smaller networks of utilities and streets as well as lower development and housing costs. 
                  (6)  Provide an environment of stable character which is compatible with surrounding residential areas. 
                  Within the planned area, a variety of land uses may be permitted in an orderly relation to one another and to existing land uses. This may be accomplished through the application of sound comprehensive planning principles. 
                  (b)  Determining if an area is suitable for inclusion within a PUD district. The factors contained in section 98-155, as well as data submitted with the development plan of the applicant for a planned unit development, must be thoroughly considered by the zoning commission as well as the mayor and council when determining whether or not the establishment of any requested PUD district is appropriate. This will ensure that rational comprehensive planning principles are the basis upon which the decision is made. Land use decisions which are based on sound planning principles encourage the development and preservation of land use patterns that provide healthful and safe living conditions for the residents of the city. The power to approve an amendment creating a PUD district rests with the mayor and council. After conducting the public hearing and considering recommendations from the zoning commission, the mayor and council will then make an official decision on the proposed planned unit development. The mayor and council may approve, disapprove, or conditionally approve the development plan. 
                  (c)  Plan review and approval procedures. Plan review and approval procedures are as follows: 
                  (1)  Pre-application conference. Prior to filing a formal application for a planned unit development, the applicant is encouraged to confer with the zoning commission in order to revise the general character of the plan, on the basis of a tentative land use sketch if available, and to obtain information on projected programs and other matters. 
                  (2)  Submission of application for PUD approval. Submission of an application for approval of a PUD shall be as follows: 
                  a.  The applicant must file a petition with the building official for approval of the proposed planned unit development. This application must be supported by a development plan and a written summary of intent. The relationship between the proposed development and the surrounding area, both existing and proposed, must be shown. The following information must be presented with the application: 
                  1.  A general location map. 
                  2.  Existing topographic conditions, including contour intervals of no more than five feet based on field surveys or photogrammetric methods. 
                  3.  The existing and proposed land uses and the approximate location of all buildings and structures. 
                  4.  The approximate location of existing and proposed streets. 
                  5.  The approximate location of all existing and proposed utilities, including a preliminary utility and drainage plan. 
                  6.  The present zoning pattern in the area. 
                  7.  A legal description of the subject property. 
                  8.  The location and use of existing and proposed public, semi-public, and community facilities such as schools, parks, and open areas on the site. This includes areas proposed to be dedicated or reserved for community or public use. 
                  9.  Perspective drawings of representative building types; however, this is not required for single-family detached dwellings. 
                  b.  If a proposed development creates special problems or involves unusual circumstances, additional information may be required in order to properly evaluate the proposal as follows: 
                  1.  An off-street parking and loading plan. 
                  2.  An economic feasibility report or market analysis. 
                  3.  A traffic study of the area, and a circulation plan within the proposed development as well as to and from existing streets adjacent to the site. 
                  c.  The written summary of intent submitted with the development plan must include the following information: 
                  1.  A statement of the present ownership of all land within the proposed development. 
                  2.  An explanation of the character of the proposed development; this includes a summary of acres, number and types of dwelling units, and gross density by type of land use. 
                  3.  A general statement of the proposed development schedule. 
                  4.  Agreements, provisions, and covenants which govern the use, maintenance, and protection of the development and any common or open areas. 
                  (3)  Review and approval of PUD application. An application for approval of a planned unit development is treated administratively as an application for an amendment to this chapter (rezoning). This is because PUD districts are created only upon request of a developer, whose application materials demonstrate a firm commitment to construction of a well designed PUD. Upon approval of the PUD, existing zoning must be changed to a PUD zone, which is an amendment to this chapter. The building official will turn over the application materials to the zoning commission for its recommendations. The zoning commission will thoroughly study the materials and make written recommendations to the mayor and council, stating the reasons for its recommendations. If the development plan is approved as submitted, the official map will be changed to indicate the PUD district. If the plan is approved with modifications, the applicant must file with the building official the following: 
                  a.  Written notice of consent to the modifications. 
                  b.  A properly revised site plan. 
                  The official map will then be changed. The site plan and supporting information of any approved plan will be properly identified and permanently filed with the city manager. No building permits will be issued by the building official until the development plan has been approved by the mayor and council. 
                  (4)  Issuance of building permits. The building official will issue building permits for buildings and structures in the area covered by the approved development plan if the proposed buildings and structures are in conformity with the approved development plan, the development schedule, and all other applicable regulations. 
                  (5)  Revision of development plan after approval of plan. Minor extensions, alterations, or modifications of existing buildings or structures may be permitted after review and approval by the mayor and council; such changes must be consistent with the purposes and intent of the development plan. Any major or substantial change in the approved development plan which affects the intent and character of the development, the density of land use pattern, the location or dimensions of streets, or similar substantial changes must be reviewed and approved by the mayor and council after receipt of recommendations from the zoning commission. A request for a revision of the development plan must be supported by a written statement indicating the nature of the revision and the reasons it is considered necessary or desirable to revise the development. 
                  (6)  Approval of PUD revoked if construction not begun. Construction of the planned unit development must begin within one year of the approval of the PUD. If no construction has begun by then, or if the applicant fails to maintain the approved development schedule, approval of the development plan will lapse. At its discretion and for good cause, the mayor and council may extend the period for beginning construction of any phase of the project for one additional year. If approval of the development plan lapses under this provision, the subject PUD district will be removed from the official map, and the zoning districts and regulations which were in effect prior to the approval of the development plan will be reinstated. It is not necessary to follow amendatory procedures for this action, since its purpose is to correct an illegal situation caused by the failure of the applicant to fulfill the conditions upon which the approval of the PUD was granted. 
                  (d)  Development standards for PUD districts. In addition to the development standards contained in section 98-155, the following standards are required within PUD districts: 
                  (1)  Development plan. An approved development plan must be carried out. 
                  (2)  Density controls. The maximum number of dwelling units per acre in residential areas of a planned unit development must not exceed 5.5 dwelling units per net acre of residential development within the PUD. Net residential acreage refers only to land devoted primarily to residential purposes, exclusive of other uses, such as common open space, streets, and lakes. Gross acreage of residential development refers to land devoted primarily to residential purposes as well as open spaces, including private lakes within the PUD held under individual, common, or collective ownership for the use of residents of the residential development. Gross acreage for residential development does not include areas reserved or dedicated for street rights-of-way. 
                  (3)  Variance in required densities. The mayor and council may allow higher net or gross residential densities, as well as a higher density of a particular residential use, as long as the applicant can show that such a higher density will not be detrimental to the surrounding neighborhood. The mayor and council will consider a variance in the required density only upon a favorable recommendation from the zoning commission. 
                  (4)  Dimensional and bulk regulations. The location of all proposed buildings and structures must be shown on the approved development plan; minimum lot sizes, setback lines, lot coverages, and floor areas shown on the development plan must be adhered to. The proposed location and arrangement of structures must not be detrimental to existing or proposed adjacent dwellings or to the development of the neighborhood. Minimum sizes for residential units shall be as specifically approved for each PUD. 
                  (5)  Perimeter requirements. The mayor and council, upon recommendation of the zoning commission, may impose one or both of the following requirements to protect the privacy of existing adjoining uses: 
                  a.  Structures or buildings located at the perimeter of the PUD must be set back a distance of 100 feet from the boundary of the PUD. 
                  b.  Structures or buildings located at the perimeter of the PUD must be permanently screened in a manner which sufficiently protects the privacy of existing adjoining uses. 
                  (6)  Control of area after completion. After completion of a planned unit development, the use of land and the construction, modification or alteration of any buildings or structures within the PUD must conform to the approved development plan. If community needs are found to be changing in the future and a revision of the approved development plan is thought to be needed, procedures contained in subsection (c)(5) of this section must be followed. 
                  (7)  Permitted uses. Those uses shown on the approved development plan shall be permitted uses. 
                  (8)  Minimum off-street parking space. Minimum off-street parking space shall be that shown on the approved development plan. 
                  (Ord. No. 748, § 1, 5-5-87) 
                  Sec. 98-49. - Expanded uses for C-1, C-2, C-3, M-1 and M-2 districts; limitations on locations of sexually oriented businesses; limitations on locations and heights of telecommunication towers; and limitations of locations of halfway houses. 
                  (a)  Expanded uses for C-1, C-2, C-3, M-1 and M-2 districts. The uses permitted in the C-1, C-2, C-3, M-2 and M-1 districts are hereby expanded so that, notwithstanding any other provisions of this article to the contrary, the uses permitted in an R-2, RTH, R-3 or P-1 district are authorized in any C-1, C-2, C-3, M-1 and M-2 district. When a use authorized in an R-2, RTH, R-3 or P-1 district is made of property located in another zone as permitted by this section, then the regulations pertaining to the particular use intended, such as minimum lot size, setback lines and like regulations, shall control in any event where they conflict with the regulations pertaining in the particular zone in which such new use is sought to be implemented. Buildings existing in a C-1 district on September 6, 1997, which is the effective date of the ordinance from which this section originally derived may be utilized for any use authorized in a C-1 district whether or not such existing building complies with any otherwise applicable front, rear or side yard requirements. 
                  (b)  Sexually oriented businesses limited to certain districts. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Code, sexually oriented businesses, as defined in chapter 68 of this Code, may be located only in an M-1 or an M-2 zoning district, and the location of such businesses within either of said districts in proximity to other such businesses, as well as in proximity to certain other land uses, shall be further limited as provided in said chapter 68 of this Code. 
                  (c)  Telecommunications towers—Locations and heights. 
                  (1)  Telecommunications towers may, subject to compliance with the provisions of chapter 83 of this Code, be located only in the following zoning districts:

                  (a)  The lots located in the following designated zoning districts shall, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Code, conform to the requirements contained in this section: 

                   

                   
                  (b)  Gateway Area One shall be subject to the following specific regulations, provisions and requirements: 
                  (1)  The minimum building setback line shall be 45 feet from the respective right-of-way line of U.S. Highway 19. 
                  (2)  That portion of Gateway Area One located between the right-of-way line of U.S. Highway 19 and a line parallel with, and 30 feet from, said right-of-way shall be a "greenspace" and: 
                  a.  Shall be devoted solely and entirely to the planting and maintenance of vegetation, as hereinafter specified, except that at each location where the Georgia Department of Transportation issues a permit to construct a vehicle entrance or exit connecting the gateway property to said highway, a strip, equivalent in width to the width allowed by such permit at the point where the said right-of-way abuts the private property line, and no greater in length than 45 feet, may be used as a driveway, and may be covered with an impervious surface, to permit vehicular access through the greenspace. 
                  b.  It shall be the duty of the owner, or the person in legal possession, of the greenspace to plant, and to maintain in living condition, by re-planting, if necessary, the greenspace in accordance with the minimum requirements provided for herein. 
                  1.  The greenspace shall be maintained as a landscaped area devoted to trees, shrubs, ground cover, mulch, and other plantings appropriate for the site. The landscaping requirements may be accomplished by retaining existing, healthy trees, shrubs and plants, by planting new trees, shrubs and plants, or any combination of retained and planted vegetation meeting the minimum standards provided for herein. 
                  2.  The minimum requirements for the greenspace are: 
                  i.  One "large" tree that will, at normal maturity, be expected to exceed 45 feet in height, for every 45 lineal feet of highway frontage, or 
                  ii.  One "medium" tree that will, at normal maturity, be expected to exceed 35 feet in height, for every 35 lineal feet of highway frontage, or 
                  iii.  One "small" tree that will, at normal maturity, be expected to exceed 20 feet in height, for every 25 lineal feet of highway frontage, or 
                  iv.  One "utility tree or shrub" that will, at normal maturity, not be expected to exceed 15 feet in height, for every 20 lineal feet of highway frontage, or 
                  v.  Any combination of the foregoing plantings to meet said lineal frontage requirements. 
                  vi.  Each tree planted to meet the foregoing requirements shall have a minimum caliper, measured at six inches above ground, of two inches. 
                  vii.  The portion of the greenspace not actually planted with trees or shrubs shall be planted with grass, ground cover, or flowers, or covered with mulch. 
                  3.  The minimum requirements set forth in subparagraph 2 are intended to be an average determined by dividing the number of trees required into the total frontage of each parcel of property, so that retained or planted trees and shrubs may be grouped as part of the landscape design. 
                  4.  The selection of tree and shrub species (for retention or planting), the height projections at maturity, and the selection of planting sites shall be made based upon the "Recommended Tree List" and "Tree Management Guidelines," promulgated by the Thomaston tree board, which are attached to Ord. No. 874 as Exhibit "A" and Exhibit "B," respectively, and by this reference incorporated herein and made a part hereof. Exhibits "A" and "B" are not set out herein, but are on file and available for inspection in the office of the city clerk. 
                  5.  The retained or planted trees and shrubs shall be the largest size, which, at maturity, meet the "Tree Management Guidelines." 
                  6.  All plantings, and retention of existing trees, shall be done in a manner to eliminate immediate and future interference with above and below ground utilities and sidewalks.

The prohibitions contained in this subsection shall not apply to any mobile home, mobile home office, or mobile home store actually in place and in use on August 17, 1967. 
                  (c)  Trailer courts. No mobile home or trailer may be placed on any lot except within a commercial trailer court as is provided for and defined in this section. Commercial trailer courts may be located only within a C-2 general commercial district, provided that:

In considering whether to change the zoning classification of any particular property, the mayor and council shall balance the benefit to the public of the present zoning classification of the property against the detriment to the property owner, and scrutinize the application in light of the character of the land in question and the zoning decision upon the property owner's right. In making such determinations, the mayor and council shall consider: 
                  (1)  The existing uses and zoning of the nearby property; 
                  (2)  The suitability of the property for the zoned purpose;

                  (b)  The mayor and council may also consider whether development of the property in the zoning classification sought: 
                  (1)  Would have an adverse effect on the insurance rating of the city, or any substantial portion thereof, issued by the Insurance Service Office or similar rating agency; 
                  (2)  Would overtax the public utilities and streets presently existing to serve the site; and 
                  (3)  Would have a substantial adverse impact on the environment, including but not limited to drainage, soil erosion and sedimentation, flooding, air quality and water quality and quantity.

                  ARTICLE VIII. - MORATORIUM ON REZONING 

                  Sec. 98-189. - Purpose. 
                  In order to protect the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens, the city has determined that a moratorium on the rezoning of property needs to be adopted and enforced for all property in the City of Thomaston. This moratorium is intended to preserve the status quo while the city re-examines the efficacy of the existing zoning ordinances within the city. 
                  (Ord. No. 1080, 9-2-14) 
                  Sec. 98-190. - Findings. 
                  The mayor and council have made the following findings of fact in consideration of this moratorium: 
                  (1)  The existing zoning ordinances largely date from the 1960s; 
                  (2)  Instead of undertaking a comprehensive review and/or revision of the city's zoning ordinances, over the years, the city has amended the zoning ordinances on multiple occasions; 
                  (3)  The zoning ordinances in certain circumstances may not reflect or adequately define trends in municipal property development; and 
                  (4)  A comprehensive review and/or revision of the zoning ordinance is in order at this time. 
                  (Ord. No. 1080, 9-2-14) 
                  Sec. 98-191. - Moratorium. 
                  The mayor and council of the City of Thomaston hereby directs its staff to accept no applications seeking to rezone property while this moratorium remains in effect. 
                  (1)  This moratorium shall be in effect for a period of one year and shall automatically expire if not reviewed by the mayor and council and if deemed necessary, renewed. 
                  (2)  This moratorium shall not apply to property already before the zoning board for purposes of rezoning. 
                  (Ord. No. 1080, 9-2-14) 
                  Sec. 98-192. - Appeals. 
                  Any party with an ownership interest in property in the city that believes said property owner is severely prejudiced by this moratorium may file an application with the city manager and/or his designee requesting that the mayor and council remove the moratorium as it applies to the property. 
                  (1)  The application shall be accepted by the city manager and/or his designee and placed on the council agenda after being properly advertised, and then, considered by the mayor and council. 
                  (2)  City staff shall only provide council with current land use and zoning information regarding the subject property and its surrounding properties and shall not make a recommendation to council on the application to lift the moratorium. 
                  (3)  In the event council lifts the moratorium, the property owner may then submit the request for rezoning following established procedures. 
                  (4)  In the event council declines to lift the moratorium, the property owner shall have the same rights and follow the same procedure as those connected with the denial of a rezoning request.

                  ARTICLE IX. - SIGNS 

                  Sec. 98-193. - Purpose. 
                  The mayor and council find that signs provide an important medium through which individuals may convey a variety of messages. However, left completely unregulated, signs can become a threat to public safety as a traffic hazard and detriment to property values and the city's overall public welfare as an aesthetic nuisance. Accordingly, it is the intention of the city to establish regulations governing the display of signs which will: 
                  (1)  Promote and protect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (2)  Enhance the economy and the business and industry of the city by promoting the reasonable, orderly and effective display of signs. 
                  (3)  Restrict signs and lights which increase clutter or which increase the probability of traffic accidents by obstructing vision. 
                  (4)  Promote signs which are compatible with their surroundings. 
                  (5)  Ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign regulations. 
                  Various and diverse businesses are located within the City of Thomaston. The need to advertise products and services must be balanced by the city's obligation to restrict clutter, maintain an aesthetically pleasing environment, protect property values, and enhance public safety. 
                  Regulation of the location, size, placement, and certain features of signs is necessary to enable the public to locate goods, services, and facilities in the city without difficulty and confusion, to improve the general attractiveness of the community, to take advantage of the beauty of the community's natural environment, and to protect property values therein. Such regulation is also necessary to facilitate and aid in the identification and location of businesses in the city in the event of police, fire, or other emergencies and to avoid confusion and delay in response to such emergencies. 
                  It is also the purpose of this article to insure proper maintenance, for safety and structural soundness, as well as the appearance and attractiveness of signs.

                  Overlay zoning means any zoning requirements such as Gateway and Greenspace or historic districts which are in addition to the underlying zoning district. 
                  Parcel shall mean a separate tax unit of real property on county real estate records. 
                  Roof sign shall mean a sign attached to or supported by the roof of a building which extends above the immediately adjacent roof line of the building. 
                  Sign shall mean a device or representation for visual communication which is used for the purpose of bringing the subject thereof to the attention of others.

                  Sec. 98-195. - Permits. 
                  All signs allowed by this article, except those exempted from obtaining a permit shall require a permit issued by the city prior to posting, displaying, substantially changing, or erecting a sign in the city. 
                  (1)  Existing signs shall be grandfathered in and shall not be required to meet this article until the existing sign is replaced. 
                  (2)  Apply for permit through the city's building and zoning office.

                  (5)  Name, address, phone number of the sign contractor and copy of valid occupational tax certificate (business license).

                  Sec. 98-197. - Time for consideration. 
                  The city shall process all sign permit applications within 30 business days of the city's actual receipt of a completed application and accompanying sign permit fee. The building and zoning office shall give notice to the applicant of the decision of the city by hand delivery or by mailing a notice, by first class mail, to the address on the permit application on or before the 30th business day after the city's receipt of the completed application and fee. If mailed, notice shall be deemed to have been given upon the date of mailing in conformity with this section. If the city fails to act within the 30 business day period, the permit shall be deemed to have been granted. 
                  (Ord. No. 1095, § 3-7-17) 
                  Sec. 98-198. - Denial and revocation. 
                  (a)  Procedure. The city's building and zoning office shall deny permits to applicants who submit applications for signs that do not comply with the provisions of this article, are incomplete applications, or applications containing any false material statements. Violation of any provision of this article will be grounds for terminating a permit granted by the city for the erection of a sign. Should it be determined that a sign permit was issued pursuant to an incomplete application or an application containing a false material statement, or that a permit has been erroneously issued in violation of this article, the building official shall revoke the permit. Should the city deny a permit, the reasons for the denial are to be stated in writing and mailed by first class mail or via hand delivery to the address on the permit application on or before the 30th business day after the city's receipt of the application. Any application denied and later resubmitted shall be deemed to have been submitted on the date of re-submission, instead of the date of the original submission. No permit shall be denied or revoked, except for due cause as hereinafter defined. "Due cause" is the violation of the provisions of this article, state or federal law related to signage, or the submission of an incomplete application or an application containing false material statements. 
                  (b)  Appeal. An individual whose permit application has been denied or a permittee whose permit has been revoked may appeal the decision of the building official to the Thomaston Zoning Board upon filing of written notice of an appeal with the building official within ten business days of the building official's decision. Such appeal shall be considered by the Thomaston Zoning Board at a called meeting. 
                  (c)  [Petition for hearing.] In the event an individual's permit has been denied or revoked, he or she may petition for a hearing before the mayor and council of the City of Thomaston by initiating the same appeals process as for other zoning appeals.

                  Sec. 98-199. - Permit expiration. 
                  A sign permit shall become null and void if the sign for which the permit was issued has not been completed and installed in accordance with the permit application within six months after the date of issuance. No refunds will be made for permit fees paid for permits that expired due to failure to erect a permitted sign. If later an individual desires to erect a sign at the same location, a new application must be processed and another fee paid in accordance with the fee schedule applicable at such time.
