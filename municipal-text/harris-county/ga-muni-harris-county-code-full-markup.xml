         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE                   This volume is a republication of the general and permanent ordinances of Harris County. Source materials for the preparation of the republished Code were the 1988 Code of Ordinances as updated through Ordinance No. 6-91, adopted October 1, 1991, Supplement No. 2, and subsequent ordinances of the County through Ordinance No. 05-02, adopted July 2, 2002. 
                  Source materials used in the preparation of the 1988 Code were the ordinances and selected resolutions, adopted by the board of commissioners. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the 1988 Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the republished Harris County Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
                  The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
                  Chapter and Section Numbering System 
                  The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as chapter 12.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
                  Page Numbering System 
                  The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

                   
                  Index 
                  The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
                  Looseleaf Supplements 
                  A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
                  Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.

                  Appeal means a request for a review of the community development director's or his designee's interpretation of any provision of this article. 
                  Area of shallow flooding means a designated AO or AH zone on a community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to three feet, and/or where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. 
                  Area of special flood hazard is the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. In the absence of official designation by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, areas of special flood hazard shall be those designated by the local community and referenced in section 4-40. 
                  Base flood means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
                  Base flood elevation (BFE) means the elevation shown on the flood insurance rate map for zones AE, AH, A1-A30, AR, AR/A, AR/AE, AR/A1-A30, AR/AH, AR/AO, V1-V30, and VE that indicates the water surface elevation resulting from a flood that has a one percent chance of equaling or exceeding that level in any given year. 
                  Basement means that portion of a building having its floor sub grade (below ground level) on all sides. 
                  Building (see definition for structure). 
                  Critical facility means any public or private facility, which, if flooded, would create an added dimension to the disaster or would increase the hazard to life and health. Critical facilities include: 
                  (1)  Structures or facilities that produce, use, or store highly volatile, flammable, explosive, toxic, or water-reactive materials; 
                  (2)  Hospitals and nursing homes, and housing for the elderly, which are likely to contain occupants who may not be sufficiently mobile to avoid the loss of life or injury during flood and storm events; 
                  (3)  Emergency operation centers or data storage centers which contain records or services that may become lost or inoperative during flood and storm events; and

                  Development means any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate, including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavating, drilling operations, and storage of materials or equipment. 
                  Elevated building means a non-basement building built to have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area elevated above the ground level by means of solid foundation perimeter walls, pilings, columns, piers, or shear walls adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a base flood event. 
                  Existing construction means for the purposes of determining rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced before December 5, 1990, [the effective date of the initial FIRM]. 
                  Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before August 19, 1986 [the effective date of the first floodplain management regulations adopted by a community]. 
                  Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed, including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads. 
                  Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
                  (1)  The overflow of inland or tidal waters; or

                  Flood hazard boundary map (FHBM) means an official map of a community, issued by the Federal Insurance Administration, where the boundaries of areas of special flood hazard have been defined as zone A. 
                  Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means an official map of a community, issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, delineating the areas of special flood hazard and/or risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
                  Flood insurance study means the official report by the Federal Insurance Administration evaluating flood hazards and containing flood profiles and water surface elevations of the base flood. 
                  Floodplain means any land area susceptible to flooding. 
                  Floodproofing means any combination of structural and non-structural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures, which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents. 
                  Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
                  Freeboard means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of floodplain management. "Freeboard" tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed. 
                  Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, adjacent to the proposed walls of a building. 
                  Historic structure means any structure that is: 
                  (1)  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register:

                  a.  By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior, or 
                  b.  Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs. 
                  Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement. An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage, in an area other than a basement, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of other provisions of this article. 
                  Manufactured home means a building, transportable in one or more sections, built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and similar transportable structures placed on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer and intended to be improved property. 
                  Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
                  Mean sea level means the average height of the sea for all stages of the tide. It is used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain. For purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are referenced. 
                  National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) as corrected in 1929 is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
                  New construction means, for the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced after December 5, 1990 [the effective date of the initial FIRM] and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced after August 19, 1986 [the effective date of the FIRST floodplain management ordinance adopted by the community] and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
                  New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed after August 19, 1986 [the effective date of the first floodplain management regulations adopted by a community]. 
                  North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) has replaced the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 in existing and future FEMA flood modernization maps. 
                  Recreational vehicle means a vehicle, which is: 
                  (1)  Built on a single chassis;

                  (4)  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
                  Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (Note: Accessory structures are NOT exempt from any ordinance requirements.) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
                  Subdivision means the division of a single lot into two or more lots for the purpose of sale or development. 
                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
                  Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the "start of construction" of the improvement. The market value of the structure should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include (1) those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project, or (2) any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure". 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this article, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article. 
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  (d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (g)  In reviewing such requests, the Harris County Board of Commissioners shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article. 
                  (h)  Conditions for variances: 
                  (1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause, 
                  b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  (2)  The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (4)  The building inspection director, in coordination with the planning and/or zoning official, shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.

                  DIVISION 2. - FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

                  Sec. 4-76. - General standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure; 
                  (2)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage; 
                  (3)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
                  (4)  Elevated buildings—All new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater. 
                  a.  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
                  (i)  Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;

                  Sec. 4-77. - Specific standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and/or substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and/or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 4-76(4), "elevated buildings". 
                  a.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  (2)  Non-residential construction. New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH zones, may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in subsection 4-49(b)(6). 
                  (3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
                  a.  All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on: (1) individual lots or parcels, (2) in new and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, (3) in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or (4) on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  b.  Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
                  (i)  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation, or 
                  (ii)  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
                  c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (Ref. subsection 4-76(6) above) 
                  d.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
                  (i)  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days. 
                  (ii)  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions), or 
                  (iii)  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "new construction", including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsection 4-77(3)c., above. 
                  (4)  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 4-44, are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
                  b.  Only if subsection 4-77(4)a. above is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of division 2.

                  (1)  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 4-44, then the building inspection director shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of division 2. Only if data are not available from these sources, then the following provisions (subsections (2) and (3)) shall apply. 
                  (2)  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 20 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in more than a one foot increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
                  (3)  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. (Note: Require the lowest floor to be elevated one foot above the estimated base flood elevation in A-zone areas where a limited detail study has been completed). Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 4-76(4), "elevated buildings". 
                  a.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site.

                  Sec. 4-94. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices. 
                  (a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the article and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of section 4-94(b) and (c) of this article. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit. 
                  (b)  Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
                  (1)  Best management practices (BMPs) as set forth in section 4-94(b) and (c) of this article shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of BMPs shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of storm water issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection, the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
                  (2)  A discharge of storm water runoff from disturbed areas where BMPs have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain BMPs shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
                  (5)  The local issuing authority may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsection (c)(15), in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
                  (c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and BMPs, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practical erosion potential; 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  (7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in runoff water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping surfaces of fills; 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in section 4-94(b)(2) of this article; 
                  (15)  There is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to O.C.G.A. Part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
                  1.  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
                  2.  Stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (d)  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in section 4-94(b) and (c) of this article. 
                  (e)  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
                  (Ord. No. 07-10, § 1, 10-5-2010; Ord. No. 01-16 , § 1, 12-20-2016) 
                  Sec. 4-95. - Application/permit process. 
                  (a)  General. The property owners, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, storm water management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
                  (b)  Application requirements. 
                  (1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of Harris County without first obtaining a permit from the Harris County Department of Community Development to perform such activity and providing a copy of the NOI submitted to EPD if applicable. 
                  (2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the Harris County Department of Community Development and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in section 4-95(c) of this article. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed to be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of section 4-94(b) and (c) of this article will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by three copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
                  (3)  A permit fee in the amount of $100.00 shall be charged for application. 
                  (4)  In addition to the foregoing permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  (5)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control pan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan with 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by section 4-94(c)(15) of this article have been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per section 4-95(b)(7) of this article, have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
                  (6)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this article section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing of the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
                  (7)  A permit applicant is required to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $1,500.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this article or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  (c)  Plan requirements. 
                  (1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in section 4-94(b) and (c) of this article; or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices.

The permit may include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
                  (2)  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this article, any variances required by section 4-94(c)(15) of this article are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per section 4-95(b)(7) of this article are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
                  (3)  Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this article, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
                  (4)  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
                  (5)  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this article. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
                  (6)  No permit shall be issued unless the applicant provides a statement by the county tax commissioner's office certifying that all ad valorem taxes levied against the property and due and owing have been paid. The local issuing authority may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(f)(1).

The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
                  (f)  The division may periodically review the actions of counties which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county in writing. The governing authority of any county so notified shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county does not take necessary corrective action within 90 days after notification by the division, the division shall revoke the certification of the county as a local issuing authority.

                  (a)  Failure to obtain a permit for land-disturbing activity. If any person commences any land-disturbing activity requiring a land-disturbing permit as prescribed in this article without first obtaining said permit, the person shall be subject to revocation of his business license, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a business and associated work activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. 
                  (b)  Stop-work orders. 
                  (1)  For the first and second violations of the provisions of this article, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have five days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within five days, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a stop-work order requiring that land-disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided, however, that if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land-disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order in lieu of a warning; 
                  (2)  For a third and each subsequent violation, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order; and; 
                  (3)  All stop-work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. 
                  (4)  When a violation in the form of taking action without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer, or significant amounts of sediment, as determined by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee, have been or are being discharged into state waters and where BMPs have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained, a stop work order shall be issued by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee. All such stop-work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop-work orders shall apply to all land-disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion, sedimentation and pollution controls. 
                  (c)  Bond forfeiture.

The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to have forfeited his performance bond, if required to post one under the provisions of section 4-95(b)(7) of this article. The local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. 
                  (d)  Monetary penalties. Any person who violates any provisions of this article, or any permit condition of limitation established pursuant to this article, or who negligently or intentionally fails or refuses to comply with any final or emergency order of the director issued as provided in this article shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 per day.

                  Sec. 4-111. - Directives. 
                  In order for the board of commissioners to accept any streets/roads within Harris County, the following directives shall be complied with: 
                  (1)  The subdivider/owner/developer of proposed streets/roads shall acquire a copy of this article. A copy may be obtained from the following county departments: public works department, community development department, or the county manager's office, from 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 noon and from 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday. 
                  (2)  Prior to beginning construction on a street/road, the subdivider/owner/developer shall consult with the public works director and submit a set of construction plans. Said plans will be reviewed for compliance; following approval, subdivider/owner/developer may proceed with construction of street/road. No construction will be started until the construction plans have been approved. 
                  (3)  After the subdivider/owner/developer has completed construction of said streets/roads to include striping and the placement of all signs (stop, curve, street signs, etc.), he/she shall forward a letter requesting an inspection by the county public works director. 
                  (4)  Upon receipt of said request, the county public works director or his designee shall conduct an inspection of said streets/roads for compliance with the approved construction plans and the road standards contained within this article. 
                  (5)  After the inspection has been accomplished, the public works director shall complete an inspection report and forward the original to the board of commissioners and a copy to the subdivider/owner/developer. This report will indicate any deficiencies noted and what the subdivider/owner/developer must correct/complete prior to the recommendation of acceptance by the public works director. If there are no deficiencies, the report will so indicate and the public works director will recommend to the board of commissioners that said streets/roads be accepted and placed on the official Harris County Road Register. 
                  (6)  After receipt of the successful inspection report, the subdivider/owner/developer shall forward to the board of commissioners (a) a four-year guarantee in the form of a cost bond, letter of credit, or certified check, effective for four years from the date of the successful inspection, in the amount of five percent of the cost of the road work done, to include drainage system, base, and paving, accompanied by a copy of the contractor's invoices for said road work; (b) a deed conveying said street/road and right-of-way to Harris County, Georgia; (c) a copy of the plat referenced in the right-of-way deed; (d) a document showing the map and parcel numbers of the property being deeded; and (e) a check to cover the cost of recording the deed. 
                  (7)  In addition to any other requirements provided for herein for the acceptance of a street/road by the board of commissioners hereunder, the subdivider/owner/developer shall provide a commitment policy of owner's title insurance to the board of commissioners insuring, except for title insurance standard exceptions, the fee simple title to the street/road being accepted by the board of commissioners and dedicated to public use. Such title insurance shall be in the amount of the cost of the road to include drainage system, base and paving. The premium for the aforementioned title insurance shall be borne by the subdivider/owner/developer of the property. The requirement for title insurance shall be a pre-requisite to the acceptance of the road by the board of commissioners. Following receipt of all required documents, a resolution for acceptance regarding the streets/roads will be prepared for consideration by the board of commissioners. Following adoption of the resolution, the deed shall be recorded, and copies of the resolution and the recorded deed will be provided to the subdivider/owner/developer upon receipt of the owner's title insurance policy, which replaces the commitment policy submitted with the road acceptance documents. 
                  (8)  Six months prior to expiration of the bond, letter of credit, or certified check, the public works director or his designee shall conduct a final inspection of said streets/roads. 
                  (9)  After the final inspection has been accomplished, the public works director shall complete a final inspection report and forward the original to the board of commissioners and a copy to the subdivider/owner/developer. This report will indicate any deficiencies noted and what the contractor must correct/complete to bring the road into compliance with the county's standards for new road construction. If the street/road does not meet standards within 60 days, the subdivider/owner/developer's bond or letter of credit will be called in, or the cash bond utilized, to accomplish required corrections. If there are no deficiencies, the report will so indicate and at the end of the four-year guarantee period, the bond, letter of credit, or a check in the amount of the original certified check shall be returned to the subdivider/owner/developer. 
                  (10)  In the event a subdivision is developed in two or more phases, at the beginning of street/road development in each phase, the subdivider/owner/developer must first furnish/post a surety bond, letter of credit, or certified check to the board of commissioners to guarantee existing county roads in the subdivision against damage directly attributable and caused by heavy truck traffic in the delivery of building materials and equipment in the construction of new structures within the subdivision. Said bond, letter of credit, or certified check shall be in the amount of 75 percent of the cost to pave the existing road, with each succeeding year to remain the same until the development is 90 percent completed and if any repairs are required as a result of damage by heavy equipment, the developer will be billed for 75 percent of the repair costs in the form of a report of damage along with a list of repairs which must be accomplished. If payment is not made to the county within 60 days, the subdivider/owner/developer will not be issued additional building permits for the subject subdivision until restitution is made. It shall be the responsibility of the subdivider/owner/developer to notify the board of commissioners when the development is 90 percent complete, and upon verification of same by the appropriate county department, if the bond or letter of credit have not been called in, or the certified check not utilized for repairs, the bond or letter of credit, or a check in the amount of the original certified check shall be returned to the subdivider/owner/developer.

                  Sec. 4-117. - Clearance of right-of-way. 
                  (a)  Any right-of-way for streets/roads to be accepted by the board of commissioners and dedicated as a public road shall, prior to acceptance by the county, be cleared of all trees, undergrowth or other obstructions for the entire width of the right-of-way. 
                  (b)  The board of commissioners shall have the authority, however, to waive the requirement that the entire right-of-way be cleared. In order to obtain such waiver the subdivider/owner/developer must make written application to the department of community development and submit a detailed engineered drawing and plat reflecting the proposed street/road and the reduced right-of-way clearing requested. The application, engineering plans and plats shall be submitted to the director of public works, the county engineer and the director of the water department for review and comment. 
                  (c)  The board of commissioners shall base its decision for a waiver for reduced right-of-way clearance on the following factors: (a) the comments and recommendations of the director of public works, the county engineer and the director of the water department; (b) the reduced right-of-way clearance shall be adequate to accommodate vehicular traffic, utilities and shall not constitute a safety hazard to vehicular traffic and the traveling public using the street/road or impede the flow of traffic thereon; (c) the reduced right-of-way clearance shall not have an adverse effect upon utility installation or maintenance and repair; (d) the reduced right-of-way clearance shall not interfere with, or restrict or impede the access to or the use of the road by Harris County vehicles (such as solid waste, law enforcement, water department, emergency fire and ambulance or road maintenance) or school buses; (e) all lots or parcels of land in the subdivision served by for the proposed road with reduced right-of-way clearance shall be no less than three acres each which may not be subsequently divided into smaller parcels; (f) the proposed road with reduced right-of-way clearance shall have curbs and gutters; (g) the purpose of the reduced right-of-way clearance shall be for aesthetic, topographical, geological or environmental reasons and shall not be an effort by the subdivider/owner/developer to reduce subdivision or road development costs. 
                  (d)  Upon satisfaction of the foregoing and approval by the board of commissioners, an subdivider/owner/developer may in the sole discretion of the board of commissioners be granted a waiver and may construct the proposed street/road with reduced right-of-way clearance. As a condition for such waiver the subdivider/owner/developer must post, in addition to any other bonds or obligations required, a five-year road maintenance bond, double the amount of the development costs of the road to provide for road repair in the event the road must be repaired because of tree roots or any other causes arising from the non-clearance of the entire width of the right-of-way. 
                  (e)  The right-of-way for which a waiver for reduced clearance is granted must be deeded to, accepted by and dedicated by Harris County for public use in accordance with Harris County ordinances. Any waiver for reduced clearance granted hereunder shall be subject to the right of Harris County Board of Commissioners to clear the right-of-way, in whole or in part and at its cost, at any time, if in its sole discretion, further clearance is deemed necessary.

                  --- (5) --- 
                  Editor's note— Ord. No. 3-92, §§ I—III, adopted Nov. 17, 1992, pertained to a procedure for acceptance of streets and roads existing prior to Nov. 17, 1992, but did not specify manner of codification; hence, inclusion herein as Div. 2, §§ 4-121—4-123, was at the discretion of the editor. In the event that conflict should arise between these provisions and §§ 4-111—4-114, it is presumed that the more recent provisions will prevail. 

                  Sec. 4-121. - Standards; classification; county funds allocation; construction limitation, repair and maintenance; cost distribution. 
                  (a)  This division does not require that the county accept any street, road or easement, hereafter referred to as "road", but authorizes acceptance upon request by the property owners and compliance with acceptance criteria as outlined in this document. 
                  (b)  Roads eligible for acceptance under this division are those roads which were in existence in unincorporated Harris County before the effective date of this division and open to the general public, and comply with acceptance criteria as outlined in this document. 
                  (c)  The responsibility for initiating the request for acceptance of any road rests upon the property owners. A separate request must be submitted for each road. 
                  (d)  Written requests for road acceptance will be received by the county manager at any time; however, the annual cut-off date for submittal is February 1 for those roads to be considered for adoption in the next fiscal year (July 1 to June 30). 
                  (e)  Following annual consideration of requests under this program, acceptance or denial of roads by the board of commissioners will be based upon: 
                  (1)  The amount of county funds available to be allocated in the next fiscal year budget for this purpose; 
                  (2)  Compliance with acceptance criteria as outlined in paragraphs (f), (g), (h), and (i) of this section; 
                  (3)  Whether the road lay-out and/or design would impose an inherent hazardous or dangerous condition for public usage; 
                  (4)  Road criteria to include physical condition of the road, road surface, roadbed, drainage, existing right-of-way, available space for additional right-of-way, any correctable engineering design defects which could affect safe traffic conditions, the number of homes served, and estimated expense to bring the road up to minimum standards under this program; 
                  (5)  Agreement of a minimum of 80 percent of property owners to donate right-of-way to the county and acknowledgment by the property owners that they will be required to pay certain assessed costs as outlined in paragraph (i) of this section. 
                  (f)  To qualify for road acceptance, the road must serve a minimum of two homes and five lots already platted and recorded as of the date of October 5, 2004. 
                  (g)  To qualify for road acceptance, a minimum right-of-way of 60 feet must be provided to Harris County to allow adequate space for the roadbed, shoulders on either side of the roadbed, drainage ditches and structures, and space for installation and maintenance of public service utilities. If layout of the road and the homes thereon prevent a right-of-way of 60 feet, the board of commissioners shall have the authority, however, to waive the requirement of 60 feet. 
                  (h)  To qualify for road acceptance, the road must abut a county or state road. 
                  (i)  Prior to acceptance of street/road, a minimum of 80 percent of the property owners must be in agreement and willing to furnish the required right-of-way, and to pay all costs associated with transfer of the right-of-way to the county. The remaining 20 percent of the property owners who do not agree to donate the right-of-way may be subject to condemnation procedures for right-of-way acquisition, at the discretion of the board of commissioners. Following acceptance and repair of street/road by the county, property owners will be billed according to a pro rata share of the total road assessment, which is comprised of the total cost for the right-of-way survey work, title/deed work, and driveway pipe for the street. The total road assessment is to be based upon the front footage of each property, for one-third of the appropriate road assessment annually, for a period of three years. If the total assessment is paid the first year, the property owner may deduct ten percent. The board may also establish additional charges for late payment and assess any cost incurred in collecting delinquent assessments and may compel compliance with reasonable rules and regulations for the provision of road acceptance and improvement. The aforementioned costs shall be collected by the tax commissioner of the county or such other official as the board shall designate. If full payment is not remitted after three years, owner's property abutting the subject road will be subject to enforcement as for delinquent property tax by issuance of fi. fas. or executions for said assessments in the same manner and with the same lien dignity and priority as fi. fas. and executions are issued for state and county taxes. Property owners must be willing to pay for any driveway pipe, if needed, before pipe is installed. 
                  (j)  Roads accepted under this program will be categorized as "Class D" roads, and will receive minimum maintenance only. 
                  (k)  When a road has been accepted for maintenance under this program, the county government will perform all repair and/or maintenance and absorb all costs for the work involved in connection with same, excluding costs for driveway pipes. 
                  (l)  When a road has been accepted as a part of the county road system, and initial repair has been completed, then it will be eligible for county maintenance as appropriate to the class, to include (a) vegetation control within right-of-way, (b) litter control within right-of-way, (c) drainage structures and ditch maintenance, (d) shoulder stabilization and maintenance, and (e) appropriate surface maintenance.

                  (3)  Request that an inspection be made by the public works department to determine whether the road meets minimum standards, as outlined in subsections 4-121(e)(3), (e)(4), (f) and (g). 
                  (4)  Based upon inspection made by the public works department, advise property owners: 
                  a.  That the road does not meet minimum acceptable standards, and what deficiencies were noted. 
                  b.  That the road meets minimum standards for acceptance, and that the request, along with the road acceptance inspection report made by the public works department, will be presented to the board of commissioners in a work session, open to the public, and the date and time of the work session. 
                  (5)  If the inspection shows that the road meets minimum standards for acceptance, schedule a work session with the board of commissioners for consideration of request(s) and inspection(s) made by the public works department. 
                  (6)  Following the work session, and upon conditional acceptance of a road by the board of commissioners, notify property owners of the conditional acceptance, advise property owners of the estimated costs to them for transfer of the right-of-way to the county, and for driveway pipes, if any, request their agreement to said estimated costs and to initiating the right-of-way acquisition by signing the notification and returning same.

                  (8)  Upon execution and recording of all right-of-way deeds, the road acceptance request will be placed on the agenda of a regular meeting of the board of commissioners for final acceptance, after which the public works director will be notified to place road on the county road register and to schedule repair and/or maintenance of subject road. 
                  (9)  When repairs have been completed, have road assessment notices prepared and mailed to property owners (subsection 4-121(i)). 
                  (10)  When appropriate, advise property owners of the rights granted to them under this document by the appeals process (section 4-123). 
                  (b)  The director of the public works department, or his designee, is specifically responsible for the road inspection and reporting phase of the program. Duties will include: 
                  (1)  Perform an inspection of the road and complete the road acceptance inspection form to include number of homes and lots being served; the existing characteristics and physical condition of the road, to include road surface, roadbed, drainage, existing right-of-way, available space for additional right-of-way; any correctable engineering design defects which could affect safe traffic conditions; any work to be performed; an estimate of the cost to the county, if any, to bring the road up to minimum standards under this program; an estimate of costs, if any, to be incurred by the property owners for driveway pipes; and whether acceptance of the road would impose an inherent hazard for public use. Submit completed form to county manager or his designee. 
                  (2)  Following notification of conditional acceptance of a road, have the approximate right-of-way staked on each lot on subject road. When requested, discuss right-of-way requirements with property owners.

                  (a)  When the public works department is advised that the cutting operations have concluded, the public works director or his/her designee will inspect the site (final inspection). If it is determined that the access site or any county roads, paved or dirt, over which pulpwood has been transported are not in a proper state of repair or damaged due to harvesting operations, the logging or pulpwood firm shall make the required repairs at its expense. 
                  (b)  Harvesters may remove culverts installed by same upon completion of their operations; provided the right-of-way shall be required to be in pre-installation condition after removal. 
                  (c)  Failure to make all necessary repairs or file a written request for arbitration as provided in subsection (d) of this section, within ten business days of written notice of the public works department shall subject the logging or pulpwood firm to payment of all county expenses associated with performing necessary road repairs. In such instance, the forfeiture of the permit holder's bond, or such other surety provided, if same has been required of applicant, shall occur and shall be utilized by the county to apply towards correcting the outstanding damage to public property. 
                  (d)  In the event the permitted logging or pulpwood firm does not agree with the amount of damages assessed by the public works director or his/her designee, the logging or pulpwood firm shall, within ten business days of receipt of the written notice so provided by the public works director of his/her designee, file a written request for arbitration with the public works department. In such instance, the county shall choose one arbitrator and the logging or pulpwood firm shall choose the second, both of whom shall be residents of the county. Together, the two designated arbitrators shall choose a third arbitrator, who in turn shall be a resident of Harris County. Within 30 days of receipt of the request for arbitration, the three designated arbitrators, known collectively as the board of arbitrators, shall render a decision. The decision of the board of arbitrators shall be final.

                  Sec. 4-151. - General. 
                  No mailbox or newspaper delivery box (hereafter referred to as a mailbox) or any other structure will be constructed on county rights-of-way if it interferes with the safety of the traveling public or the function, maintenance, or operation of the road system. A mailbox installation that does not conform to the provisions of this article is an unauthorized encroachment. 
                  The location and construction of mailboxes shall conform to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Postal Service as well as to standards established by the county. 
                  A mailbox installation that conforms to the following criteria will be considered acceptable unless in the judgment of the public works director of the county, the installation interferes with the safety of the traveling public or the function, maintenance, or operation of the road system. 
                  (Ord. No. 2-94, 2-15-94) 
                  Sec. 4-152. - Location. 
                  (a)  No mailbox will be permitted where access is obtained from the lanes of a freeway or where access is otherwise prohibited by law or regulation. 
                  (b)  Mailboxes shall be located on the right-hand side of the roadway in the direction of the delivery route except on one-way streets where they may be placed on the left-hand side. The bottom of the box shall be set at an elevation established by the U.S. Postal Service, usually between three feet, six inches and four feet above the roadway surface. The roadside face of the box shall be offset from the edge of the traveled way a minimum distance of the greater of the following: A foot (where no paved shoulder exists), the width of the all-weather shoulder present plus eight to 12 inches, or the width of an all-weather turnout specified by the county plus eight to 12 inches. 
                  (c)  Exceptions to the lateral placement criteria above will exist on residential streets and certain designated rural routes where the county deems it in the public interest to permit lesser clearances or to require greater clearances. On curbed streets, the roadside face of the mailbox shall be set back from the face of curb a distance between six and 12 inches. On residential streets without curbs or all-weather shoulders and that carry low-traffic volumes operating at low speeds, the roadside face of a mailbox shall be offset between eight and 12 inches behind the edge of pavement. On very low-volume rural roads with low-operating speeds, the county may find it acceptable to offset mailboxes a minimum of six feet, eight inches from the traveled ways and under some low-volume, low-speed conditions may find clearance as low as two feet, eight inches acceptable. 
                  (d)  Where a mailbox is located at a driveway entrance, it shall be placed on the far side of the driveway in the direction of the delivery route. 
                  (e)  Where a mailbox is located at an intersection road, it shall be located a minimum of 100 feet beyond the center of the intersecting road in the direction of the delivery route. This distance shall be increased to 200 feet when the average daily traffic on the intersecting road exceeds 400 vehicles per day.

                  (a)  It shall by unlawful for mailbox supports or any other structure to be constructed on the right-of-way of brick, stone or concrete material. 
                  (b)  Mailboxes shall be of light sheet metal or plastic construction conforming to the requirements of the U.S. Postal Service. Newspaper delivery boxes shall be of light sheet metal or plastic construction of minimum dimensions suitable for holding a newspaper. 
                  (c)  No more than two mailboxes may be mounted on a support structure unless the support structure and mailbox arrangement have been shown to be safe by crash testing. However, lightweight newspaper boxes may be mounted below the mailbox on the side of the mailbox support. 
                  (d)  Mailbox supports shall not be set in concrete unless the support design has been shown to be safe by crash tests when so installed. 
                  (e)  A single four-inch by four-inch or a 4½-inch diameter wooden post or a metal post with a strength no greater than a two-inch diameter standard strength steel pipe and embedded no more than 24 inches into the ground will be acceptable as a mailbox support. A metal post shall not be fitted with an anchor plate, but it may have an anti-twist device that extends no more than ten inches below the ground surface. 
                  (f)  The post-to-box attachment details should be of sufficient strength to prevent the box from separating from the post top if the installation is struck by a vehicle. 
                  (g)  The minimum spacing between the centers of support posts shall be three-fourths the height of the posts above the groundline. 
                  (h)  Mailbox support designs not described in this regulation will be acceptable if approved by the public works director of the county.

                  ARTICLE VIII. - WETLANDS PROTECTION 

                  Sec. 4-161. - Findings and purpose. 
                  (a)  Findings of fact. The wetlands within this county are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion, and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife, and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; open space, and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well-being of many communities within the state. 
                  Nationally, a considerable number of these important natural resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution, and other acts. Piecemeal or cumulative losses will, over time, destroy additional wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare. 
                  It is therefore necessary for the county to ensure maximum protection for wetlands by discouraging development activities in wetlands that may adversely affect wetlands. 
                  (b)  Title and purpose. This article shall be known as the Wetland Protection Ordinance of Harris County, Georgia. The purposes of this article are to promote wise use of wetlands and protect wetlands, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational, and aesthetic values. Activities which may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practicable as determined by a permitting process. The objective of this article is to protect wetlands from alterations which will significantly affect or reduce their primary functions for water quality, floodplain and erosion control, ground water recharge, aesthetic nature, and wildlife areas.

                  Sec. 4-162. - Definitions. 
                  [As used in this article, the following words and terms shall have the meaning ascribed thereto:] 
                  Functions: The beneficial roles that wetlands serve, including: Storage, conveyance, and attenuation of floodwater and stormwater; protection of water quality and reduction of erosion; habitat for wildlife, including rare, threatened and endangered species; food chain support for a wide variety of wildlife and fisheries; educational, historical, and archeological value protection; and scenic, aesthetic, and recreational amenities. 
                  Hydric soils: Soils that form as a result of saturated soils conditions. A list of these soils is maintained by the USDA Department of Natural Resources Conservation Service. 
                  Hydrophytic vegetation. Macrophytic plants tolerant of or dependent on saturated soil conditions. 
                  Jurisdictional determination: An official, written statement or map signed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, or in the case of coastal marshlands, the Georgia Department of Natural Resources. 
                  Jurisdictional wetland: A wetland area that meets the definitional requirements for wetlands as determined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
                  Wetland: An area that is inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency and distribution sufficient to support, and under normal circumstances does support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions, commonly known as hydrophytic vegetation. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas. 
                  Wetland delineation: The establishment of wetland boundaries by a representative of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers or an authority designated by the corps. 
                  Wetland district: All wetlands within the jurisdiction of Harris County.

                  Sec. 4-163. - Wetland protection district. 
                  (a)  Application. This article shall apply to all lands within wetlands located within the jurisdiction of the county. The Generalized Wetland Map, and all future revisions, adopted as part of this article, shows the general location of wetlands and should be consulted by persons contemplating activities in or near wetlands before engaging in a regulated activity. The Generalized Wetland Map, together with all explanatory matter thereon and attached thereto, is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this article. The Generalized Wetland Map shall be on file in the office of the county department of community development. 
                  (b)  Boundaries. The Generalized Wetland Map is a general reference document and wetland boundaries indicated on the map are approximations. The purpose of the Generalized Wetland Map is to alert developers/landowners if they are within proximity to a wetland, which means that there is a high likelihood of the presence of a jurisdictional wetland and a need for the developer/landowner to seek U.S. Army Corps of Engineers guidance as to whether a section 404 permit will be required prior to any activity. The Generalized Wetland Identification Map does not represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the jurisdiction of the county and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this article does not relieve the land owner from federal or state permitting requirements.

                  Sec. 4-164. - Local development permits. 
                  (a)  Local development permit requirements. No regulated activity will be allowed within the Generalized Wetland Protection District without written permission from the county department of community development in the form of a local development permit. Issuance of a local development permit is contingent on full compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable regulations. All activities that are not identified in subsection (b) below or by other local development ordinances, shall be prohibited without prior issuance of a local development permit. If the area proposed for development is located within 1,320 feet of the Generalized Wetland Protection District boundary, as determined from the Generalized Wetland Map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required. If the corps determines that wetlands are present and that a section 404 permit or letter of permission is required, a local development permit will be issued only following issuance of the section 404 permit or letter of permission. 
                  (b)  Permissible uses (uses as of right). The following uses shall be allowed as a right within a wetland to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining, or dredging except as provided herein. Operations conducted during normal silvicultural activities, including minor dredge and fill association with road construction, harvesting, and reforestation practices are excepted from these requirements. 
                  (1)  Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish, and other wildlife, provided they do not affect waters of Georgia or of the United States in such a way that would require an individual 404 permit. 
                  (2)  Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding, and canoeing. 
                  (3)  Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the Georgia Forestry Commission. 
                  (4)  The cultivation of agricultural crops. Agricultural activities shall be subject to best management practices approved by the Georgia Department of Agriculture. 
                  (5)  The pasturing of livestock. 
                  (6)  Education, scientific research, and nature trails. 
                  (7)  Temporary emergency permit. A temporary emergency permit can be issued by the county department of community development for the following reasons: 
                  •  Maintenance or repair of lawfully located roads or structures and of facilities used in the service of the public to provide transportation, electric, gas, water, telephone, telegraph, telecommunication or other services, provided that such roads, structures, or facilities are not materially changed or enlarged and written notice prior to the commencement of work has been given to the Harris County Department of Community Development and provided that the work is conducted using best management practices to ensure that flow and circulation patterns, and chemical and biological characteristics of the wetland, are not impaired and that any adverse effect on the aquatic environment will be minimized; 
                  •  Temporary water-level stabilization measures associated with silvicultural operations, provided that they are necessary to alleviate abnormally wet or dry conditions that would have an adverse impact on the conduct of silviculture activities if not corrected. 
                  •  Limited ditching, tilling, dredging, excavating, or filling done solely for the purpose of maintaining or repairing existing drainage systems necessary for the cultivation of agricultural crops, provided that the maintenance or repair activity does not result in the impairment, alteration, or loss of wetlands not previously subject to agricultural and silvicultural use under the terms and provisions of subsection (b)(4). 
                  •  Limited excavating and filling necessary for the repair and maintenance of piers, walkways, nature trails, observation decks, wildlife management shelters, boathouses, or other similar water-related structures, provided that they are built on pilings to allow unobstructed flow of water and preserve the natural contour of the wetland. 
                  (c)  Site plans. Applications for a development permit within the Generalized Wetland Protection District shall include a site plan, drawn at a scale of one inch equals 50 feet, with the following information: 
                  (1)  A map of all planned excavation and fill, including calculations of the volume of cut and fill involved, cross-sectional drawings showing existing and proposed grades. Elevations, horizontal scale, and vertical scale must be shown on the cross-sectional drawings. 
                  (2)  Location, dimensions and area of all impervious surfaces, both existing and proposed, on the site and adjacent to the site for a distance of 100 feet. 
                  (3)  The orientation and distance from the boundaries of the proposed site to the nearest bank of an affected perennial stream or water body. 
                  (4)  Elevations of the site and adjacent lands within 200 feet of the site at contour intervals of no greater than two feet. 
                  (5)  Location and detailed design of any spill and leak collection systems designed for the purpose of containing accidentally released hazardous or toxic materials. 
                  (6)  All proposed temporary disruptions or diversions of local hydrology. 
                  (d)  Activities to comply with site plan. All development activities or site work conducted after approval of the site plan shall conform with the specifications of said site plan. The site plan may be amended only with the approval of the county department of community development. The governing authority may require a bond in the amount of $1,000.00.

                  (a)  Statement of intent. It is generally recognized by medical authorities throughout the nation that smoking is a major factor influencing premature death and disability. In light of the tremendous amount of evidence supporting this conclusion, a no-smoking policy is hereby established, in order to protect the rights of non-smoking employees and citizens. 
                  (b)  Smoking. Smoking is prohibited in all buildings owned or operated by the county board of commissioners. Provided, this prohibition shall not apply to those buildings designated as dormitories or housing units which are part of the Harris County Correctional Institute.

                  (c)  Signs. No-smoking signs shall be placed conspicuously in the buildings in which smoking is prohibited, as well as to the main entrance to the Harris County Courthouse. Employees and citizens should note that it is a violation of state law to smoke in an area which has a no smoking sign posted (O.C.G.A. § 16-12-2). 
                  (d)  Applicability. The provisions of this section shall apply to all county employees, employees of other agencies, and the general public. Employees and the general public are reminded that the success of this section will depend upon the thoughtfulness, consideration and cooperation of smokers and nonsmokers. All officers and employees of the county share the responsibility for adhering to and enforcing this section. 
                  (e)  Penalty. 
                  (1)  A violation of this section shall be treated as any other violation of any other county ordinance and shall be adjudicated in the magistrate's court. 
                  (2)  The penalty imposed by the magistrate's court notwithstanding, any county employee who violates this section may be disciplined as for a violation of any other county policy as provided for in the county personal manual.

                  DIVISION 2. - AQUIFER RECHARGE AREA PROTECTION 

                  Sec. 5-110. - Title, findings, and objectives. 
                  (a)  Title. This division shall be known as the Aquifer Recharge Area Protection Ordinance of Harris County, Georgia. 
                  (b)  Findings of fact. In order to provide for the health, safety and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within the county, and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be ensured. For this reason, it is necessary to protect the subsurface water resources that the county and surrounding communities rely on as sources of public water. Groundwater resources are contained within aquifers, which are permeable, rock strata occupying vast regions of the subsurface. These aquifers are replenished by infiltration of stormwater runoff in zones of the surface known as aquifer recharge areas. 
                  Aquifers are susceptible to contamination when unrestricted development occurs within significant aquifer recharge areas. It is, therefore, necessary to manage land use within aquifer recharge zones in order to ensure that pollution threats are minimized. 
                  (c)  Objectives. The objectives of this division are to: 
                  (1)  Protect groundwater by prohibiting land uses that generate dangerous pollutants in recharge areas; 
                  (2)  Protect groundwater by limiting density of development; and 
                  (3)  Protect groundwater by ensuring that the development that occurs within the recharge area shall have no adverse effect on groundwater quality.

                  Sec. 5-111. - Definitions. 
                  [As used in this division, the following words and terms shall have the meaning ascribed thereto:] 
                  Aquifer: A layer or formation of rock beneath the earth's surface that bears significant amounts of groundwater. 
                  Aquifer recharge area: An area of the earth's surface where water infiltrates the ground, thereby replenishing the groundwater supplies within the aquifer. 
                  Pollution susceptibility: The relative vulnerability of an aquifer to pollution from chemical spills, leaching of pollutants from dump sites, or other human activities. 
                  Pollution susceptibility map(s): Maps prepared by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources that show the relative susceptibility of aquifers to pollution. Pollution susceptibility maps categorize the land areas of the state into areas of high, medium, and low groundwater pollution potential. 
                  Significant aquifer recharge area: Areas mapped by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources in Hydrological Atlas 18 (1989 edition). Mapping of recharge area is based on outcrop area, lithology (chemical nature and form of the rock), soil type, and thickness, slope, density of lithologic contacts, geologic structure, presence of "karst" topography (sinkholes, caves, and fissures associated with limestone and other carbonate rocks), and potentiometric surfaces.

The statement of the public officer shall be transmitted within 90 days of completion of the repairs, demolition or closure. It shall be the duty of the Tax Commissioner of Harris County or his designee, whose duties include the collection of Harris County taxes, to collect the amount of the lien using methods available for collecting real property ad valorem taxes, including specifically O.C.G.A. Title 48, Chapter 4 provided, however, that the limitation of O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 which requires 12 months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure shall not apply. The county or its employee shall remit the amount collected to the governing authority of the county. 
                  (3)  Enforcement of liens pursuant to this article may be initiated at any time following receipt by the county or its employee of the final determination of costs in accordance with this article. The unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties from and after the date of final determination of costs in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes. An enforcement proceeding pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 for delinquent ad valorem taxes may include all amounts due under this article.

A business or practitioner with more than one type of service, operation or product at the same location shall total the number of employees in computing its tax liability under this article. In addition, a business or practitioner with no employees is taxed per the following schedule.

If such act, omission or violation is done by an agent, servant, employee, or officer of the licensee, the lack of knowledge on the part of the licensee or the lack of authorization for such act or omission or violation shall be no defense. 
                  (3)  Moral turpitude. The entry of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, or the conviction of any licensee with respect to a charge in violation of any federal, state, or local laws relating to alcohol control, or any crime, whether a felony or not, involving moral turpitude.

                  (2)  Recommendation to board of commissioners. Immediately following the summary suspension of a license, the sheriff shall forward a written report to the board of commissioners regarding said summary suspension, and shall recommend action to be taken by the board, i.e., suspension for a definite period of time, or revocation of the license. 
                  (3)  Certificate of occupational tax. Failure to maintain a current certificate of occupational tax for the establishment for which alcoholic beverage license(s) has been issued will result in the suspension of such alcoholic beverage license(s) until such time as evidence of valid/current certificate of occupational tax is provided to the office of the board of commissioners. 
                  (d)  Time limit for issuing new license after revocation.

If the motion relates to a matter in which evidence has already been heard, it is discretionary with the board of commissioners as to whether to grant the motion for rehearing. If the substance of the complaint made was not the subject of a prior hearing at which the protestant was permitted to be present and heard, the board of commissioners shall afford a hearing within 15 working days after the filing of the motion, of which reasonable notice shall be given to all parties known to the board of commissioners to be interested. Persons interested in protesting or supporting the action of the commission shall be allowed to appear, be represented, and introduce oral and documentary evidence, and examine and cross-examine witnesses.

                  Sec. 6-170. - Off-site sewer facilities costs; sewer bond issue. 
                  (a)  The cost of the off-site sewer facilities including the sewer line from the Muscogee County line to the property, including financing costs, is approximately $5,400,000.00. 
                  (b)  The authority has financed the installation costs and costs of issuance of the bonds through a revenue bond issue (the "bonds") in an amount which includes actual cost of planning, designing and installing the off-site sewer facilities, plus bond issuance. 
                  ( Ord. No. 01-15 , § 1, 3-17-2015) 
                  Sec. 6-171. - Bond fund. 
                  (a)  The authority has agreed in the Intergovernmental Contract and Service Agreement to deposit into a separate fund known as the "bond fund" the following promptly upon receipt: 
                  (1)  Advanced sewer tap fees provided for below; 
                  (2)  Amounts pursuant to the Intergovernmental Contract received from the county equal to cash sewer tap fees for the property; 
                  (3)  Amounts pursuant to the Intergovernmental Contract received from the county equal to the special sewer tax, if any, as provided below. 
                  The Intergovernmental Contract and the Service Agreement make provision for the following, as set forth below in this paragraph. The bond fund will be invested and investment returns (within the limits of applicable arbitrage and rebate rules) will be added to the fund. Amounts in the bond fund will be applied only to the payment of principal and interest on the bonds. If the bond fund is sufficient to pay all interest, prepayment premium (if any), principal and other charges with respect to the bonds, and if the bonds are subject to optional prepayment, the authority, at its own instance, may, or upon written request by the developer will, apply the bond fund to the prepayment, in whole or in part, of the bonds at the earliest practicable time. 
                  (b)  The Intergovernmental Contract and the Service Agreement provide that authority will cause to be maintained proper books and records of the bond fund, including deposits and withdrawals with an explanation of each item, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and will make the books and records available for inspection by the developer at all reasonable times. 
                  ( Ord. No. 01-15 , § 1, 3-17-2015) 
                  Sec. 6-172. - Advanced sewer tap fees. 
                  (a)  In order to provide financial assurance to the authority for the repayment of the bonds, the developer has agreed to 30 days in advance of each of the first 14 semiannual payment dates of the bonds (or until the bonds are paid in full, if earlier) pay, if amounts expected in the bond fund will not be sufficient to pay the debt service on the bonds in the coming year, the sum necessary to satisfy such insufficiency to the authority ("advanced sewer tap fees") as an advance on its tap fee credit (described in the following paragraph (b)). Such obligation of the developer was to be secured prior to the issuance of the bonds by guarantees or letters of credit in a manner satisfactory to the authority. The Service Agreement provides that the developer has the right, but not the obligation, to pay to the authority additional amounts to be applied to payment of the bonds and treated as advanced sewer tap fees. 
                  (b)  The Intergovernmental Contract provided that the developer shall be given a sewer tap fee credit ("tap fee credit") equal to the sum of the advanced sewer tap fees theretofore paid to the authority by the developer not applied as provided below, that the tap fee credit shall be personal property of the developer, and that so long as no project deficiency has occurred and is continuing, upon request by the developer, sewer tap fees otherwise to be charged by the county for the property shall be treated as paid by and deducted from the tap fee credit. The Intergovernmental Contract provides that no transferee of any part of the property is to acquire any rights to the tap fee credit unless the developer, with notice to the county and the authority, in writing transfers such rights to the transferee; provided, however, that the developer shall remain responsible, liable and bound to all obligations under the Service Agreement notwithstanding any such assignment. The Intergovernmental Contract further provides that upon the exhaustion of the tap fee credit (which may be re-established by any additional advanced sewer tap fees paid hereunder), the county shall be entitled to receive in cash all sewer tap fees with respect to the property, subject to its obligation under the Intergovernmental Contract to pay amounts equal to certain sewer tap fees to the authority for deposit in the bond fund. 
                  ( Ord. No. 01-15 , § 1, 3-17-2015) 
                  Sec. 6-173. - Special tax district. 
                  The property identified as Harris County Tax Parcels 032-003, 032-039, 032-040, 032-042, 032-043A, 033-014, and 033-015 as designated and numbered by the Tax Assessor of Harris County as of January 1, 2015, and shown on the map attached to this article maintained by the county clerk in the ordinance files, is hereby and shall be designated as a special tax district. In the event that the amount reasonably expected to be in the bond fund for the next calendar year is not sufficient to pay the principal and interest payments on the bonds due in the year, the county shall levy a "special sewer tax" (herein so called) on the special tax district for the subject year in the amount estimated to make up the insufficiency (a "debt service deficiency") and payable in time to meet debt service on the bonds, and that amounts equal to the special sewer tax receipts shall be paid to the authority pursuant to the Intergovernmental Contract and be deposited by the authority in the bond fund. In the event the developer defaults on the payment of its obligations in Section 4.3 of the Service Agreement to pay advanced sewer tap fees, the county shall levy, without duplication, a special sewer tax on the special tax district for the subject year in the amount of the default of the developer, and such special sewer tax receipts, if sufficient, shall be treated as curing the default in the payment of advanced sewer tap fees under Section 4.3(a) of the Service Agreement; and any excess of such receipts shall be paid to the authority pursuant to the Intergovernmental Contract and be deposited in the bond fund. 
                  Any tax levied as a special tax hereunder shall be levied on all of the foregoing Harris County Tax parcels regardless of the ownership of said property at the time of the levy. The county shall have its usual liens and remedies to collect any special sewer tax. The special tax district designation will be removed upon payment in full of the bonds.

                  ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

                  Sec. 7-1. - Utility facilities and equipment near county roads. 
                  (a)  In order to more efficiently provide for the safety of persons and vehicles traveling on the county roads, and the maintenance of roads in the county, the board of commissioners does ordain and enact into law the provisions of this section, as allowed under O.C.G.A. § 32-4-42(6). 
                  (b)  When a utility company, private company, or an individual plans to place any type utility wire, line, cable, conduit, pipe or any other object under ground along the rights-of-way of the county's roads, streets or easements, they must first secure a written permit from the board of commissioners. 
                  (c)  Application for a permit for utility facility encroachment shall be presented to the board of commissioners with a sketch or plan attached indicating the exact location of subject line, conduit, etc. The application form can be secured from the county road superintendent's office. 
                  (d)  Any type utility wire, line, cable, conduit, pipe or any other object to be laid underground shall be placed a minimum of three feet deep and placed as close as possible along the back side of the right-of-way. Unless otherwise approved by the board of commissioners, all water pipes, sewer pipes, etc., shall be placed on the right side of the road (as one drives north to south or east to west); and all telephone, electrical and other cables, etc., shall be placed on the left side of the road (as one drives north to south or east to west). Any variance to this directive must be approved by the board of commissioners prior to construction. 
                  (e)  When the board of commissioners shall reasonably determine that any pipe, main, conduit, cable, wire, pole, tower or other signal, and other equipment, facilities or appliances of any utility in, on, along, over or under the public roads of the county should be removed or relocated, because it has become an obstruction or interference with the use and safe operation of a county road, or will become an obstruction or interference with the use and safe operation of a contemplated county road, a written notice shall be directed to the utility company giving at least 60 days' notice in which to make such change as is necessary for removal or relocation as may be necessary. If the utility does not thereafter begin removal procedures within a reasonable time sufficient to allow for engineering and other activities necessary to the removal and relocation of the utility facility, the commissioners may give the utility a final notice directing that such removal shall commence not later than ten days from receipt of such final notice. If such removal has not begun, or if such removal has begun and the relocation has not been completed within a reasonable time, the county commissioners may remove or relocate the same with its own employees, or by contracted labor, tools, equipment, supervision, or other necessary services or materials and whatever else is necessary to accomplish the removal or relocation, and the expense thereof shall be charged to the utility. The expense shall be certified to the county attorney, who shall have the authority to proceed with suit against the utility for same if payment or arrangements to make payment are not made within 60 days. 
                  (f)  Nothing in this section shall be construed so as to deprive any utility, relocated from a location in which it owned a property interest, of compensation for such property interest.

                  (a)  If the consumer believes his water bill to be in error, he shall present his claim, in person, at the waterworks office in Cataula, Georgia, before the bill becomes delinquent. Such claim, if made after the bill has become delinquent, shall not be effective in preventing discontinuance of service as provided in this article. The consumer may pay such bill under protest and such payment shall not prejudice his claim. 
                  (b)  The county shall make a special water meter reading at the request of a consumer for a fee; provided, however, that if such special reading discloses that the meter was over-read, no charge shall be made.

The owner shall indemnify Harris County from any loss or damage that may directly or indirectly be caused by the installation of the building sewer. 
                  (d)  Number of sewers required. A separate and independent building sewer shall be provided by the owner for every building; except where one building stands at the rear of another on an interior lot and no private sewer is available or can be constructed to the rear building through an adjoining alley, court, yard or driveway, the building sewer from the front building may be extended to the rear building and the whole considered as one building sewer. 
                  (e)  Old building sewer acceptable. Old building sewers may be used in connection with new buildings only when, on examination and test by Harris County they meet all requirements of this division. 
                  (f)  Technical specifications. The size, slope, alignment, materials of construction of a building sewer, and the methods to be used in excavating, placing of the pipe, jointing, testing, and backfilling the trench, shall all conform to the specifications of Harris County for the design and installation of sewer mains in Harris County. 
                  (g)  Sewer depth and pumping requirement. Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the building at an elevation below the basement floor or concrete slab. In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit gravity flow, based on minimum hydraulic design, to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such building drain shall be lifted up and discharged to the building sewer at the expense of and maintained by the owner. 
                  (h)  Surface runoff prohibited. No person or property owner shall make a connection of roof downspouts, exterior foundations drains, areaway drains or other sources of unpolluted surface runoff or groundwater to a building/facility sewer or building which in turn is connected directly or indirectly to a public sanitary sewer. If a connection already exists, the person or property owner shall have, upon notification by Harris County, 90 days to remove the illegal connection. 
                  Facilities such as, but not limited to carwashes and detail shops must have in place devices/structures to prevent surface runoff from entering the sanitary sewer. Approved devices/structures may include the following: roofs, structure sides, berms, and other applications approved by Harris County. If the connection has been previously approved by Harris County, a fee or surcharge may be imposed on the facility for the treatment of the surface runoff and to compensate for the extra hydraulic loading. 
                  (i)  Connections to public sewer. The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall conform to the specifications for the design and installation of sewer mains in Harris County. Harris County requires that all such connections shall be made gastight and watertight.

                  Sec. 7-77. - Prohibitions and limitations of wastewater discharges. 
                  (a)  General discharge prohibitions. No user shall contribute or distribute, directly or indirectly, any pollutant or wastewater that will cause interference or pass-through of the POTW. These general prohibitions apply to all users of a POTW in addition to all other provisions of the general pretreatment regulations for existing and new sources of pollution (40 CFR Part 403) or any national, state, or local pretreatment requirements. A user may not contribute or distribute the following substances to any POTW. 
                  (1)  Any liquids, solids, or gases which by reason of their nature or quantity are, or may become, sufficient either alone or by interaction with other substances to cause fire or explosion or be injurious in any other way to the POTW or to the operation of the POTW. Prohibited materials include, but are not limited to, gasoline, naphtha, benzene, fuel oil or any wastestream which has a closed-cup flash point of less than 140° F (60° C) using the test methods specified in 40 CFR 261.21 and which is a fire hazard to the system. 
                  (2)  Any solid or viscous substances which may cause obstruction to the flow in a sewer or other interference with the operation of the wastewater treatment facilities such as, but not limited to: grease, garbage with particles greater than one-half inch in any dimension, animal guts or tissues, paunch, manure, bones, hair hides or fleshings, entrails, whole blood, feathers, ashes, cinders, sand, spent lime, stone or marble dust, metal, glass, straw, shavings, grass clippings, rags, spent grains, spent hops, waste paper, wood, plastics, gas, tar, asphalt residues, residues from refining, or processing of fuel or lubricating oil, mud, or glass grinding or polishing wastes. 
                  (3)  Any wastewater having a pH less than 5.5 or greater than 10.0 or wastewater having any other corrosive property capable of causing damage or hazard to structures, equipment, and/or personnel of the POTW. A user that discharges less than 50,000 gallons per day of process wastewater, may be allowed to discharge wastewater having a pH not less than 5.5 or greater than 11.0 as determined and approved by Harris County. 
                  (4)  Any wastewater containing toxic pollutants in sufficient quantity, either singly or by interaction with other pollutants, to injure or interfere with any wastewater treatment process, constitute a hazard to humans or animals, create a toxic effect in the receiving waters of the POTW, or to exceed the limitation set forth in a categorical pretreatment standard. A toxic pollutant shall include but not be limited to any pollutant identified pursuant Section 307(a) of the Act, Sara Title III or TTO list. 
                  In the event of toxicity being found in the POTW, Harris County may at its discretion require industrial users to participate in a toxicity reduction evaluation in accordance with the provisions of the Harris County NPDES permits. 
                  (5)  Any pollutants that are noxious, toxic or malodorous liquids, gases, or solids which either singly or by interaction with other wastes are sufficient to create a public nuisance or an acute hazard to life or are sufficient to prevent entry into the sewers for maintenance and repair. 
                  (6)  Any substance which may cause the POTW's effluent or any other product of the POTW such as residues, sludges, or scums to be unsuitable for reclamation and reuse or to interfere with the reclamation process. In no case shall a substance discharged to the POTW cause the POTW to be in non-compliance with sludge use or disposal criteria, guidelines or regulations developed under Section 405 of the Act; any criteria, guidelines, or regulations affecting sludge use or disposal developed pursuant to the Solid Waste Disposal Act, the Clean Air Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, or state criteria applicable to the sludge management method being used. 
                  (7)  Any substance, which will cause the POTW to violate its NPDES permit or the receiving stream water quality standards. 
                  (8)  Wastewater which imparts color which cannot be removed by the treatment process, such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable tanning solutions, which consequently imparts color to the treatment plant's effluent, thereby violating Harris County's NPDES permit. 
                  (9)  Heat in amounts which will inhibit biological activity in POTW treatment plant resulting in interference or heat in amounts along with corrosive characteristics of the wastewater, accelerate corrosion of the collection system piping or pump station structures and/or pump station equipment, but in no case wastewater with a temperature at the introduction into the public sewer which exceeds 65.5° C (150° F). Also prohibited is any wastewater with a temperature which will cause the temperature at the POTW influent to exceed 40° C (104° F). 
                  (10)  Any slug discharge of wastes, including oxygen demanding pollutants (BOD, COD, etc.) released at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration which will cause interference to the POTW. 
                  (11)  Any wastewater containing any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-life or concentration as may exceed limits established in compliance with applicable state or federal regulations. 
                  (12)  Any petroleum oil, non-biodegradable cutting oil, or products of mineral oil origin in amounts that will cause interference or pass through. 
                  (13)  Trucked or hauled pollutants, except at discharge points designated by Harris County in accordance with section 7-75(f) of this division. 
                  (b)  National Pretreatment Standards. The categorical pretreatment standards found in 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N are hereby incorporated. Certain industrial users are now or shall become subject to these categorical pretreatment standards promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency, specifying quantities or concentrations of pollutants or pollutant properties which may be discharged into the POTW. All industrial users subject to categorical pretreatment standard may also be subject to the limitations established in column B of section 7-77(c) or by the State of Georgia. Compliance with categorical pretreatment standards for existing sources shall be subject to the requirements in section 7-80(n) of this division. Compliance with categorical pretreatment standards for new sources shall be required upon promulgation of the standard by the Environmental Protection Agency. 
                  (c)  Limitations on wastewater strength and flow rate. No person or user shall discharge wastewater in excess of the concentration set forth in column A below unless a special permit condition is issued with their wastewater discharge permit. Special permit conditions may be issued for the following reasons: 
                  (1)  The user is in compliance with categorical pretreatment standards, and the receiving plant's influent wastewater characteristic is within the guidelines established to protect the treatment plant operations and receiving stream water quality. 
                  (2)  In the case whereas the industrial user will have to construct or build a system to treat its effluent to within the permitted limits, a compliance schedule may be set forth for a particular industrial user to comply with permitted limits. 
                  (3)  For industrial users having discharges of less than 10,000 gallons per day, a mass limit may be applied based on the maximum acceptable concentration at a flow of 10,000 gallons per day. 
                  Tabulated in column B are the maximum concentrations of the indicated constituents that are allowed in the waste stream at the influent of a treatment facility. Should these concentrations be exceeded, the discharge limits of the industrial users may be reduced below the limits in column A. The industrial users may be required to reduce their concentrations to alternate limits set by Harris County to ensure that the level in the POTW influent does not exceed the concentrations in column B. 

                   
                  The Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards may establish limits for parameters not listed previously in this section, including specific organic substances. Any industry subject to these federal standards shall be required to meet the established limits through a permit issued by Harris County. In addition, Harris County may limit the discharge of other specific substances not listed above on a case-by-case basis, if the discharge of that substance is shown to interfere with the operation or performance of the receiving POTW or violates any receiving stream water quality standards. 
                  (d)  Dilution prohibited. No user shall increase the use of process water or, in any way, attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations contained in the National Categorical Pretreatment Standards, or in any other pollutant-specific limitation developed by Harris County or the state. Harris County may impose mass limitations on an industrial users which are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases where the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. 
                  (e)  Accidental discharges. Each industrial user shall provide protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this division. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the owner's or user's own cost and expense. In the case of an accidental discharge, it is the responsibility of the user to immediately notify the POTW of the incident. The notification shall include location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, and corrective actions. Within five days following an accidental discharge, the industrial user shall submit to Harris County a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences as required by CFR 403. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this division to other applicable law. Any user may be required by Harris County to prepare and submit for approval a spill prevention/contingency plan. A spill prevention/contingency plan must address, at a minimum, the following: 
                  (1)  Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch discharges; 
                  (2)  Description of stored chemicals and a site map indicating the areas where these chemicals are stored; 
                  (3)  Procedures for immediately notifying Harris County and any of the required government and local agencies of any accidental discharge or spill, required in the above paragraph of this section; 
                  (4)  Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or spill discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site run-off, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants, including solvent, and/or measures and equipment for emergency response. 
                  (f)  Pretreatment. Users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to comply with this division and shall achieve compliance with all National Categorical Pretreatment Standards within the time limitations as specified by the Federal Pretreatment Regulations. Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level in compliance with the provisions of the division shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to Harris County for review, and shall be in compliance with the provisions of this division before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to Harris County under the provisions of this division. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported to and be acceptable to Harris County as in compliance with the provisions of this division prior to the user's initiation of the changes. 
                  (g)  Hazardous waste notification. 
                  (1)  Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification shall also contain the following information to the extent such information is known and is readily available to the user: identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, and estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge commences. Any notifications under this paragraph need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under section 7-80(c)(9) of this division. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under self-monitoring requirements of section 7-80(c)(5) of this division. 
                  (2)  Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of paragraph (1), during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous waste as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
                  (3)  In the case of any new regulations under 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify Harris County, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of such regulations. 
                  (4)  In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
                  (5)  This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this division, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law. No hazardous waste may be discharged without prior approval by Harris County. 
                  (h)  Slug discharges. At least once every two years, Harris County shall evaluate whether each significant industrial user needs a slug control plan. For the purposes of this subsection, a slug discharge is any discharge of non-routine, episodic nature, including, but not limited to a non-customary batch discharge. Harris County may require any user to develop, submit for approval, and implement such a plan for the control of slug discharges. Alternatively, Harris County may develop such a plan for any user. A slug discharge control plan shall address at a minimum, the following: 
                  (1)  Description of discharge practices, including non-routine and routine batch discharges, lockout procedures for all process tanks and storage tanks; 
                  (2)  Description of stored chemicals in all process areas; 
                  (3)  Procedures for immediately notifying Harris County of any accidental or slug discharges, as required in the above paragraph of this section; 
                  (4)  Procedures to prevent adverse impacts from any slug discharges. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transferring of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site run-off, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency response.

                  Sec. 7-78. - Fees. 
                  (a)  Purpose. It is the purpose of this section to provide for the recovery of costs from users of the Harris County wastewater disposal system. The applicable charges or fees shall be set forth in the Harris County schedule of charges and fees. 
                  (b)  Charges and fees. The Board of Commissioners of Harris County may adopt charges and fees and from time to time modify, change, alter, increase or decrease said charges and fees for users of the Harris County POTW. Sewer service charges shall be prepared and rendered with the water bill. Harris County is also authorized to assess a separate fee for industrial users for costs incurred by Harris County and related to the pretreatment requirements of this division. The monthly sewer service charge for users of public sewers including those facilities that are assessed a surcharge as described in section 7-78(c) who are supplied either wholly or in part with water from wells or sources of supply other than Harris County shall be based on the measured waste flow using the rates in effect at the time. The owners of the premises or other interested parties shall install a flow measuring device on their waste discharge lines at no expense to Harris County. The flow measuring device shall be of a type that shall perform within ± two percent of accuracy and shall be located so as to be readily accessible to representatives of Harris County. The flow measuring devices shall be calibrated at least once per six months or whenever requested by Harris County. 
                  (c)  Surcharges. All persons discharging high strength waste into the public sewers shall be charged and assessed a surcharge set by Harris County, in addition to any sewer service charge, if these wastes have a concentration of BOD in excess of 300 parts per million, suspended solids in excess of 300 parts per million, and/or oil and grease in excess of 100 parts per million (note: oil and grease concentrations in excess of 200 parts per million is a violation of section 7-77(c) of this division). The surcharge rate is established by Board of Commissioners of Harris County based on the pounds of BOD, suspended solids, and oil and grease discharges in excess of the concentrations stated above. 
                  Said high strength waste (as defined above) of each user discharging same into the public sewers shall be subject to inspection periodically. A determination of character and concentration of said waste shall be made semiannually, or more frequently as determined by Harris County. The concentration of BOD and suspended solids determined from these inspections shall be used to compute the monthly surcharges. Harris County reserves the right to use COD concentrations in lieu of BOD concentrations, if the BOD concentrations of the effluent wastestream cannot be obtained due to interference from chemical constituents in the wastestream. Under these circumstances, COD concentrations may be used to determine the BOD concentrations. The laboratory methods used in the examination of the waste shall be those set forth in 40 CFR 136. 
                  (d)  Grease, oil and sand interceptors. Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing grease in excessive amounts, any flammable wastes, sands and any other harmful pollutants; except that such interceptors shall not be required for single family dwelling units. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity specified by the Harris County grease trap program, section 7-79 of this division. Failure to comply may result in termination of water/wastewater services and/or fines as outlined in the section 7-82 of this division. 
                  (e)  Special agreements. No statement contained in this division shall be construed as preventing any special agreement between Harris County and any industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by Harris County for treatment, subject to payment therefore by the industrial concern. The terms and condition of any such agreement may not, however result in a violation on any industrial pretreatment regulations for existing and new sources of pollution.

                  1.  The categorical pretreatment standards applicable to each regulated process. 
                  2.  The results of sampling and analysis identifying the nature and concentration, and/or mass, where required by the standard or by Harris County, of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process. Instantaneous, daily maximum, and long-term average concentrations, or mass, where required shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of daily operations and shall be analyzed in accordance with procedures set out in section 7-79(c) of this division. 
                  3.  Sampling must be performed in accordance with 40 CFR 403.7(C)(iv). 
                  f.  Certification. A statement, reviewed by the user's authorized representative and certified by a qualified professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not, whether additional operation and maintenance (OandM) and/or additional pretreatment is required to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements. 
                  g.  Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or OandM will be required to meet the pretreatment standards, the shortest schedule by which the user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or OandM. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment standard. 
                  h.  Signature and certification. All baseline monitoring reports must be signed and certified in accordance with section 7-80(j) of this division. 
                  (m)  Compliance schedule. The following conditions shall apply to the compliance schedule required by section 7-80(l)(2)g. of this division: 
                  (1)  The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the applicable pretreatment standards (such events include, but are not limited to, hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts for major components and completing construction, and beginning and conducting routine operation); 
                  (2)  No increment referred to above shall exceed nine months; 
                  (3)  The user shall submit a progress report to Harris County no later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final date of compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate, the steps being taken by the user to return to the established schedule, and; 
                  (4)  In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress reports to Harris County. 
                  (n)  Compliance with categorical standards. Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source following commencement of the introduction of wastewater to the POTW, any user subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to Harris County a report containing the information described in section 7-80(l) of this division. For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR 403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long-term production rate. For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with section 7-80(j) of this division. 
                  (o)  Compliance reports (self-monitoring). 
                  (1)  All significant industrial users shall, at a frequency determined by Harris County, but in no case less than twice per year (in June and December), submit a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with section 7-80(j) of this division. 
                  (2)  All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
                  (3)  If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by Harris County, using the procedures prescribed in section 7-80(r) of this division, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report. 
                  (p)  Changed conditions. Each user must notify Harris County of any planned significant changes to the user's operations or system which might alter the nature, quality, or volume or its wastewater at least 90 days before the change. 
                  (1)  Harris County may require the user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under section 7-80(a) of this division. 
                  (2)  Harris County may issue a wastewater discharge permit under section 7-80(d) of this division or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under section 7-80(d) of this division in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions. 
                  (3)  For purposes of this requirement, significant changes include, but are not limited to, flow increases of 20 percent or greater, and the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants. 
                  (q)  Notice of violation/repeat sampling and reporting. If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify Harris County within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to Harris County within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. The user is not required to resample if: 
                  (1)  Harris County performs sampling at the industrial user at a frequency of at least once per month, or 
                  (2)  Harris County performs sampling at the user between the time when the user performs its initial sampling and the time when the user receives the results of this sampling. 
                  (r)  Sample collection. 
                  (1)  Except as indicated in subsection (2), below, the user must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, Harris County may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this provides a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits. 
                  (2)  Samples for oil and grease, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. 
                  (s)  Analytical requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques described in 40 CFR 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses not be performed in accordance with procedures approved by the EPA. 
                  (t)  Record keeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this division shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this division and any additional records if information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user is independent of such requirements. Records shall include the date, exact place, method and time of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or Harris County, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by Harris County. 
                  (Ord. No. 07-14 , § 8, 12-16-2014) 
                  Sec. 7-81. - Enforcement. 
                  Harris County reserves the right to administer any of, but not limited to, the following enforcement actions. In addition to the following enforcement actions, Harris County administers a pretreatment enforcement response plan that specifies a step by step enforcement action program. 
                  (1)  Emergency termination of service. In the event of an actual or threatened discharge to the POTW of any pollutant which presents an imminent and substantial danger to the health or safety of persons, or danger of interference with the POTW, Harris County shall immediately notify the industrial user or other person causing or responsible for the condition and request their assistance in abating the same. Harris County may temporarily terminate service of such user or users to abate the condition when such action is reasonably necessary. Such service shall be restored by Harris County as soon as the emergency situation has been abated or corrected. 
                  (2)  Notification of violation. Any person found to be violating any provision of this division shall be served by Harris County with written notice stating the nature of the violation and providing reasonable time limit in days, weeks or months, for the satisfactory correction thereof. The user shall, within the period of time stated in such notice, permanently cease and/or remedy all violations. 
                  (3)  Administrative orders. Administrative orders (AOs) are enforcement documents that direct non-domestic users to undertake or to cease specified activities. The terms of AOs may or may not be negotiated with non-domestic users. AOs are used as the first formal response to significant noncompliance. Four common types of AOs are: 
                  a.  Consent agreements. A negotiated agreement with the IU in which both parties agree to actions to be taken to return to compliance. 
                  b.  Cease and desist orders. A directive to an IU to discontinue an action that is resulting in noncompliance. 
                  c.  Show cause orders. Formal meeting requiring the IU to appear and demonstrate why Harris County should not take a proposed enforcement action against it. The meeting may also serve as a forum to discuss corrective actions and compliance schedules. 
                  d.  Compliance orders (compliance schedules). A time schedule of activities to be completed to return an IU to compliance. 
                  Consent agreements are the first formal response to significant noncompliance in which terms are negotiated with the user. If the consent agreement fails to be effective, other AOs without user negotiation will be used. 
                  (4)  Revocation of permit. Any user who violates the following conditions of this division and/or applicable state and federal laws and/or regulations, is subject to revocation of his permit in accordance with the procedures of section 7-81 of this division: 
                  a.  Failure of a user to report factually the wastewater constituents and characteristics of his discharge; 
                  b.  Failure of the user to report material changes in his operation, or wastewater constituents and characteristics; 
                  c.  Refusal of access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, sampling, testing or monitoring; or, 
                  d.  Violation of conditions of his permit in accordance with the provisions of this division. 
                  (5)  Show cause hearing. Harris County may issue a notice directing a user to appear before the board at a specified date and time to show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken in response to a violation of this division, other applicable law or regulation, or conditions in the user's wastewater discharge permit. 
                  The board may itself conduct the hearing and take the evidence, or it may designate any of its members or any officer or employee of the board to conduct the hearing and transmit a report of the evidence and hearing, with recommendations, to the board for action thereon. 
                  After the board has reviewed the evidence, it may take action for violations as authorized under section 7-82 of the division. 
                  (6)  Injunctive relief. Harris County, Georgia, may file in Superior Court of Harris County, Georgia, or any other appropriate forum a suit seeking the issuance of an injunction, damages, and/or other appropriate relief to enforce the provisions of this division or other applicable law or regulation. Such a suit may include any and all damages suffered by Harris County, Georgia, or the board as a result of any action, omissions, or inaction of any user or other person who causes or permits damage to occur to the POTW, or for any other expense, cost, loss or damage of any kind or nature suffered by Harris County, Georgia, or any branch, department or agency thereof. 
                  (7)  Damaging facilities. No person shall maliciously, willfully or negligently break, damage, destroy, remove, uncover, deface or tamper with any structure, appurtenance or equipment which is a part of Harris County or the sewerage work of Harris County, Georgia. Any person violating this provision shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. 
                  (8)  Affirmative defense for upsets. 
                  a.  For the purpose of this section, an upset means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, lack of preventative maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
                  b.  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of paragraph c., below are met. 
                  c.  A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
                  1.  An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset; 
                  2.  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and, 
                  3.  The user has submitted the following information to Harris County within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided orally, written submission must be provided within five days): 
                  i.  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
                  ii.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times, or if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; 
                  iii.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the noncompliance; 
                  iv.  In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof; 
                  v.  Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards; 
                  vi.  User shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails. 
                  (9)  Affirmative defense for prohibited discharge. A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in section 7-77 of this division if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either: 
                  a.  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or 
                  b.  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when Harris County was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements. 
                  (10)  Affirmative defense for bypasses. 
                  a.  For the purposes of this section; 
                  1.  A bypass means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a user's treatment facility. 
                  2.  Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which cause them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
                  b.  A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provisions of paragraphs c. and d. of this section. 
                  c.  1.  If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to Harris County, at least ten days before the date of the bypasses, if possible. 
                  2.  A user shall submit oral notice to Harris County of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall be submitted within five business days of the bypass as required per CFR 403. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. Harris County may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours. 
                  d.  1.  Bypass is prohibited, and Harris County may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless: 
                  i.  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
                  ii.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and, 
                  iii.  The user submitted notices as required under paragraph c. of this section. 
                  2.  Harris County may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if Harris County determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in paragraph d.1. of this section. All decisions on validity of affirmative defenses will be made by the board of commissioners or its designee and such decisions will be final.

                  Sec. 7-82. - Penalties. 
                  (a)  Actions by Harris County. Should water or wastes be discharged to the POTW in violation of any provisions of this division, the board may after notifying the offender and providing a hearing before the board: 
                  (1)  Terminate water service and/or the discharge of water and wastes by the violator into the POTW; 
                  (2)  Require pretreatment into a condition as authorized and/or required by this division, or any water or waters into the POTW; 
                  (3)  Require control over the quantities and flow rates of water or wastes entering the POTW as authorized and/or required by this division; 
                  (4)  Require payment by the violator to cover the added capital and operating costs, not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges, of handling and treating otherwise prohibited wastes, which can be documented as reasonable charges for the materials, supplies, labor and other costs actually required. 
                  (5)  Revoke the user's permit; 
                  (6)  Any person failing to pay any sewer charges authorized by this division shall be subject to termination of their sewer service. 
                  Any person who violates any provision of this division shall, upon conviction in the Magistrate Court of Harris County, Georgia, be punished by a fine and/or imprisonment at the discretion of the magistrate. 
                  Further, any industrial user who violates any provisions of section 7-77(h) of this division, shall be subject to a civil or criminal action to be brought by Harris County, and if found to be in violation, civil or criminal penalties up to at least $1,000.00 violation per day may be awarded. 
                  (b)  Falsifying information. Any person who knowingly makes any false statements, representation, omission or certification in any application, record, report, plan or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this division or falsify, tamper with, or knowingly render inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this division or reports of any such monitoring device or method may be subject to a fine or imprisonment under applicable state or federal law.

A new ordinance was adopted and effective Jan. 2, 1990. Amendatory ordinances have been included in their proper places, and a history note following the affected section has been included.

                  ARTICLE IV. - ZONING DISTRICT OBJECTIVES, USES AND REGULATIONS 

                  Sec. 1. - District objectives. 
                  1.1. A/O Apartment/Office: 
                  The purpose of this district is to create an environment especially suited to a group of professional, general administrative and general sales offices, together with high-density residential uses. 
                  1.2. A-1 General Agricultural and Forestry District: 
                  The objective of this district is to preserve land areas suitable for eventual rezoning when the need and availability of community facilities warrant its development. The types of uses, area and intensity of development permitted in this district are designed to protect agricultural uses until rezoning is warranted and appropriate changes in districts can be made. 
                  This district also allows live-work units. See definitions (article II) and supplementary district regulations (article V). 
                  No new A-1 General Agricultural and Forestry District can be created which contains less than four acres. 
                  1.3. R-R Rural Residential District: 
                  The objective of this district is to preserve the natural resources and environmentally sensitive areas of the county while providing for low density residential use. 
                  No new R-R district may be created which contains less than ten acres. 
                  1.4. R-1 Low-Density Residential District: 
                  The objective of this district is to preserve land areas for single dwelling unit structures and to promote residential areas with low densities. These areas are intended to be geographically defined and protected from the encroachment of uses not performing a function necessary to a residential environment. Certain nonresidential uses which are more compatible with residential uses may be permitted on review by the board of zoning adjustment. In addition to the primary structure, only one detached residential structure shall be permitted on the same lot as the primary structure, shall be on the same utilities as the primary structure, shall be no more than 800 square feet, and shall be located to the rear or side yard of the primary structure. Prohibited are: detached structures which may be or are intended to be rented out as living areas. 
                  No new R-1 Low-Density Residential District may be created which contains less than four (4) acres. 
                  1.5. R-2 Medium-Density Residential District: 
                  The objective of this district is to provide and preserve land areas for single dwelling unit structures and low-density multiple dwelling unit structures, not to exceed two dwelling units per structure, which will achieve an overall medium density of residential development. Certain uses which are more compatible with residential uses than with nonresidential uses are also permitted on review of the board of zoning adjustment. R-2 districts should be located in areas with good proximity to central community facilities and in areas where a stable transition from one district or density or development to another is desirable. 
                  No new R-2 Medium-Density Residential District may be created which contains less than four acres. 
                  1.6. R-3 High-Density Residential District: 
                  The objective of this district is to promote and encourage the development of multidwelling unit structures in areas served by facilities and services necessary to result in efficient, but not overcrowded, high-density residential development. Intensities of land development should be limited to avoid congestion of building and traffic and to provide adequate open space for a health-ful and tasteful environment. Nonresidential uses permitted on review should be limited to those necessary to directly serve residents in high-density residential districts. 
                  No new R-3 High-Density Residential District may be created which contains less than four acres. 
                  1.7. C-1 Central Business [Commercial] District: 
                  The objective of this district is to provide and preserve a central area of intensive commercial, financial, professional, governmental and cultural activities scaled to pedestrian needs. Uses which do not require a central location and create hazards in the performance of centralized functions are discouraged. 
                  This district also allows live-work units. See definitions (article II) and supplementary district regulations (article V). 
                  No new C-1 Central Business [Commercial] District may be created which contains less than four acres. 
                  1.8. C-3 Neighborhood Commercial District: 
                  The objective of this district is to encourage unified groupings of retail and personnel service outlets that provide for the daily needs and the convenience of residential neighborhood residents. It is intended that neighborhood shopping areas be developed as units with adequate off-street parking and access controls and with appropriate buffers to protect and preserve surrounding residential development. 
                  This district also allows live-work units. See definitions (article II) and supplementary district regulations (article V). 
                  No new C-3 Neighborhood Commercial District may be created which contains less than three acres. 
                  1.9. C-4 Highway Commercial District: 
                  The objective of this district is to provide areas for the development of commercial establishments which cater specifically to motor vehicle needs. It is also the intent of this district to provide adequate land areas in terms of width and depth to meet the needs of commercial development where access is dependent on vehicular trade. In certain instances where the objectives of this district can be met, manufacturing activities where products are sold on the premises only may be permitted. The location and development of these commercial activities shall be encouraged so as to minimize traffic hazards and interference with adjacent uses. 
                  This district also allows live-work units. See definitions (article II) and supplementary district regulations (article V). 
                  No new C-4 Highway Commercial District may be created which contains less than four acres. 
                  1.10. M-1 General Manufacturing District: 
                  The objective of this district is to provide areas for the development of light manufacturing and assembly plants and their related activities. It is also the intent of this district that noise, odor, dust and glare associated with uses permitted in this district be confined with buildings so as to minimize the effects upon adjacent development and uses. It is also the intent of this district that traffic generated by uses permitted including raw materials, finished products and employees, be minimal but that transportation facilities and routes be easily accessible. 
                  No new M-1 General Manufacturing District may be created which contains less than five acres. 
                  1.11. M-2 Heavy Manufacturing District and Sexually Oriented Establishment District: 
                  The objective of this district is to provide areas which are suitable for manufacturing uses which might produce objectionable characteristics as a part of their normal operational activities but to minimize their effects upon surrounding development through strict adherence to performance standards and by review of manufacturing uses which produce abnormal objectional characteristics and to provide areas which are suitable for sexually oriented establishment uses which studies have shown might produce objectionable characteristics through adverse secondary effects into the surrounding community. 
                  No new M-2 Heavy Manufacturing District or Sexually Oriented Establishment District may be created which contains less than ten acres. 
                  1.12. MHU-1 Manufactured Housing Unit District—Parks:

                  3.15. PUD Planned Unit Developments: 
                  See definitions (Article II) and notes below: 
                  The intent of Planned Unit Development (PUD) zoning is to permit greater flexibility and, consequently, more creative and imaginative design for development of residential, commercial, or manufacturing areas than is generally possible under conventional zoning regulations. It is further intended to promote more economical and efficient use of land while providing a harmonious variety of housing choices, higher level of amenities, and preservation of natural qualities of open spaces. Within the PUD zones, a variety of housing types and land uses may be permitted in an orderly relationship to one another and to existing land uses, as well as with due regard to comprehensive planning within Harris County. 
                  The regulations and development plan requirements for each PUD, listed below, are intended to evaluate each application on its own merit. It is recognized that some concepts will be more appropriate than others and the approval of an application in one location does not necessarily indicate the development will be applicable in other locations. It should be emphasized that those provisions are not to be used to circumvent the intent or use of conventional zoning standards. Certain development standards, including but not limited to height limitations, nonresidential building densities, interior setbacks, and total tract coverage, shall be approved conditionally by the board of commissioners.

                  3.17. CUPD Community Unit Planned Development. 
                  See definitions (Article II) and notes below: 
                  The intent of the Community Unit Planned Development is to encourage large, planned mixed use developments, which shall include both residential and commercial components, at locations within the County that can physically and environmentally accommodate development of an urban character and where sufficient transportation infrastructure, utility infrastructure, and governmental services are either planned or readily available to support the development. The mixed-use nature of the developments should encourage the integration of diverse land uses and promote sustainable economic growth and the creation of jobs. 
                  A.  General requirements. 
                  1.  Uses. Uses of property and buildings in this District are the same as those permitted in A-O, R-1, R-2, R-3, C-1, C-3, C-4, CORD and M-1 Districts. Individual buildings within a CUPD may be used for any or a combination of land uses permitted in this District except that M-1 uses shall not be combined with R-1, R-2, R-3 or A-O uses within a single building. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, when there are multiple, primary uses contained within a building, then (a) the setback requirements that normally apply between different uses shall not apply to require any separation of the uses within a building; and (b) the parking requirements for the building shall be the total of the individual parking requirements for the different uses contained therein, provided, however, that the parking requirements, if any, for any commonly used areas within the building shall be no greater than the requirement for that use within the building requiring the least amount of parking. 
                  2.  Minimum area. The minimum area permitted to be zoned for a CUPD is five hundred (500) acres. 
                  3.  Green space. Each CUPD shall have a minimum of twenty (20) percent of the gross acres of the CUPD dedicated or set aside as green space. For the purposes of these district regulations, the term "green space" shall mean a public or privately-owned area within the property outside of any principal building, parking area or the landscaped grounds of any single-family residence, which is open to the sky and set aside and intended for the outdoor enjoyment of occupant(s) within or visitors to the property, including but not limited to natural areas subject to conservation easements or limited to open space pursuant to recorded covenants, and which may but is not required to include such pedestrian-oriented improvements as landscaping, sidewalks, walkway paths, pergolas, gazebos, bikeways, golf cart paths, exercise or play equipment, swimming pools, cabanas, ball fields, benches and golf courses and fifty (50) percent of any flood plain or other areas inappropriate for construction. Greenspace shall not include any areas included within the right-of-way of any roads, parkways, parking lots, or other paved surfaces. The gross acres set aside as greenspace shall not include or be made up of more than fifty (50) percent of water bodies, lakes, ponds, streams, or retention ponds. 
                  4.  Accessory uses. A property in the CUPD district may contain any accessory structure or use customarily related to and subordinate to any principal use permitted herein. 
                  5.  Density. Overall density is permitted to be greater in a CUPD district than in other districts to (a) create an environment less dependent on automobile travel and (b) support infrastructure costs associated with such developments and (c) consolidate development on less land to preserve more green space and open land. 
                  6.  Requirement for sewer and water. Any lot other than single-family residential lots and any single-family residential lot smaller than two acres in size shall be served by either a public or private sanitary sewer system. Single-family residential lots two (2) acres or greater in size may be served by septic tanks, but no septic tank may serve more than one (1) single-family lot. All structures, whether residential or commercial, will be served by public water. 
                  7.  Compliance with special CUPD district regulations. Uses within a CUPD shall be required to comply with the development regulations for that use contained elsewhere in this ordinance, (including but not limited to minimum lot size, density, minimum lot width, minimum setbacks, maximum coverage by principal buildings, maximum building height, minimum floor area of a dwelling unit, screening and buffers) except to the extent that there are different regulations for that aspect of the development of property within the CUPD set forth elsewhere in the Special CUPD District Regulations in which case the Special CUPD District Regulations shall apply, control over and supercede the development regulations set forth elsewhere in this ordinance. 
                  8.  No requirements for common ownership. Property within a CUPD may be owned by multiple property owners and still retain its status as a CUPD provided that there is a property owners association or other organization which is responsible for the control and maintenance of those portions of the property that are available to be used by all owners of property within the CUPD. 
                  9.  No requirement to abut a public street. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein, no use within a CUPD shall be required to abut or be accessed by a public street provided that said use abuts or is accessed by a private street maintained by a mandatory membership property owners association or other organization that is responsible for the control and maintenance of the private street. With the exception of street width and curb and gutter requirements, all private streets must be built to comply with county standards. Private drives and private alleyways shall not be considered streets. 
                  10.  Perimeter set-back requirement. Except as provided for below, the building setback line adjacent to the exterior boundary of the CUPD shall be one hundred (100) feet. Notwithstanding the above, where the exterior boundary line of the CUPD is adjacent to a state or federal highway, or major transportation corridor, arterial or collector street, the building setback line shall be fifty (50) feet. 
                  11.  Perimeter buffer. There shall be a 50-foot natural buffer or planted buffer around the perimeter of the CUPD with the exception that there shall only be a requirements for a 20-foot natural buffer, planted buffer or planted landscape strip around the perimeter of any property zoned CUPD where the property within the CUPD, directly adjacent to said buffer or strip, is designated for non-residential or non-industrial uses and said property fronts on a state or federal highway, major transportation corridor, arterial or collector street. All buffers shall comply with any adjoining zoning uses. 
                  12.  Interior buffer. Except as may be otherwise provided for herein, there shall be a 25-foot natural or planted buffer or planted landscape strip separating residential uses from industrial or commercial uses within the CUPD. Notwithstanding the above, this requirement for a buffer or landscape strip may be waived administratively by the board of commissioners or its designee in situations where residential use(s) abuts commercial use(s) and it is determined the commercial use(s) will serve the residential areas within the CUPD, will be physically configured in a way where they are accessible to pedestrians, will serve as a focal point for community interaction, and will not have an adverse impact on surrounding residential use(s). 
                  13.  General buffer guidelines. All buffers may be disturbed to accommodate utility installation, grading, the installation and maintenance of a fence, berm, wall or walking trail, and other construction activities provided that it is re-planted upon the completion of the activity which disturbs the buffer. A fence or wall (no thicker in its widest part than forty-eight (48) inches) shall be permitted to be constructed along the outer exterior boundary of any buffer area. Walking trails are permitted within buffer areas. Dead, diseased and overgrown or overplanted trees, shrubs and other landscaping may be removed from all buffer areas to preserve the buffer in a neat, attractive and healthy condition fit on a long-term basis for its intended purpose as a buffer. 
                  B.  Conceptual master plan. Any person, firm, company or other business entity applying for a zoning amendment to establish a CUPD shall along with the zoning application submit a conceptual master plan, along with the appropriate applications and fees, to the department of community development, consisting of: 
                  1.  A site plan showing:

                  e.  The access to the site and general traffic circulation therein. 
                  f.  Buffers adjacent to the property not subject to the CUPD. 
                  2.  The project shall be located in an area for which public facilities and services are available and adequate for the uses that are proposed; provided, however, that the applicant may provide such facilities which are not presently available, and written assurances of such provision shall be included as a part of the conceptual master plan which is submitted. 
                  3.  A comprehensive impact analysis indicating the probable effect of the CUPD on the county school system, emergency services (fire, police, EMS) and any probable impact on existing traffic patterns and capacities of adjacent roads/streets in the immediate area. Such analysis shall be prepared by a professional civil engineer, registered in the State of Georgia, or other individual whose profession lends itself to adequate analysis. 
                  4.  The planning commission and board of commissioners shall review and act on the proposed zoning request for a CUPD and the conceptual master plan in accordance with the zoning ordinance. Upon the approval by the board of commissioners of the uses and densities contained in a conceptual master plan, and any buffers within the CUPD adjacent to property not subject to the CUPD, said densities shall not be exceeded, new uses introduced or buffer requirements reduced unless an amendment to the CUPD has been approved by the planning commission and board of commissioners to: (a) permit additional uses at specified densities; (b) increase the densities of already permitted use; and/or as the case may be (c) reduce the buffers requirements for property within the CUPD that is adjacent to property not subject to the CUPD. Except for the above, applicant shall have the right to modify the conceptual master plan approved by the Board of Commissioners, including the right to transfer or shift permitted uses and densities to different locations within the CUPD so long as the overall level of development yields of the approved plan are not exceeded. 
                  C.  Final development plan requirements. Prior to removal of natural vegetation, restructuring of land, or construction of any improvements, an approved final development plan is required. All final development plans for that portion of the CUPD where development activities will be occurring shall be submitted to the department of community development for review and approval by the zoning administrator, and shall contain:

                  ARTICLE V. - SUPPLEMENTARY DISTRICT REGULATIONS 

                  Sec. 1. - Corner visibility. 
                  On a corner lot in any zoning district except the C-l Central Commercial District, nothing shall be erected, placed, planted, or allowed to grow in such a manner as materially to impede vision between a height of two and a half (2½) and ten (10) feet above the centerline grades of the intersecting streets in the area bounded by the street lines of such corner lots and a line joining points along said street lines fifty (50) feet from the point of the intersection. 
                  Sec. 2. - Signs. 
                  2.1. General provisions. 
                  This article shall hereafter be known and cited as the Harris County Sign Ordinance. 
                  2.2. Findings. 
                  2.2.1. The county finds that signs are a proper use of private property, are a means of personal free expression and a necessary component of a commercial environment. As such, signs are entitled to the protection of the law. In the absence of regulation, however, the number of signs tends to proliferate, with property owners desiring an increasing number and size of signs, leading to cluttered and aesthetically blighted thoroughfares. In addition, the competition among competing sign owners for visibility of their signs contributes to safety hazards for both vehicles and pedestrians and undermines the sign owners' original purpose of presenting a clear message of its idea or identification of its premises. 
                  2.2.2. The county finds that the regulation of the size, height, number and spacing of signs is necessary to protect the public safety, to assure compatibility of signs with surrounding land uses, to enhance the business and economy of the county, to protect the public investment in the streets and highways, to maintain the tranquil environment of residential areas, to promote industry and commerce, to eliminate visual clutter and blight, to provide an aesthetically appealing environment, and to provide for the orderly and reasonable display of advertising for the benefit of all the county's citizens. 
                  2.2.3. The county finds that there is a substantial difference between signs erected by public authority and signs erected by private citizens or businesses. Signs erected by public authority are virtually all erected for the purpose of maintaining the public safety either through direct control of traffic or through provision of such type signage as street signs which enable the traveling public to know where they are located and to find where they are going. As such, with the exception of signs identifying government buildings, virtually all government signs are erected purely for public safety purposes. Moreover, their use in the public right-of-way is necessary to ensure their visibility to the motoring public. The county commission finds that public utility signs are frequently of the same nature as those signs erected by governmental entities in that they provide necessary information to safeguard the public from downed power lines and from street excavations. Even where signs serve a propriety purpose, such as identifying markings on utility poles, those signs are marked primarily for the purpose of benefitting the public generally through identification of locations where there may be temporary losses of power. 
                  2.2.4. The county finds that some signage has a single targeted function and that identification of such signage by description is impossible without referring to its function. For instance, address numerals are used for the sole purpose of location addresses, which is of benefit to persons looking for those addresses and is essential to public safety personnel responding to emergencies. Subdivision signs at the entrances to subdivisions favor a similar purpose in enabling both the traveling public and emergency personnel to quickly locate subdivision entrances for the purpose of either visitation or responding to emergency calls. While such signage is referenced based upon the function it serves within the context of this ordinance, the bulk of the provisions of this chapter are unrelated to the content of the speech provided and allow maximum expressive potential to sign owners. 
                  2.3. Intent and purpose.

                  ARTICLE VI-A. - STANDARDS FOR TELECOMMUNICATIONS ANTENNAS AND TOWERS 

                  Sec. 1. - Purposes. 
                  This ordinance is designed and intended to balance the interests of the residents of Harris County, telecommunications providers, and telecommunications customers in the siting of telecommunications facilities within unincorporated Harris County so as to protect the health, safety, and integrity of residential neighborhoods; and to foster, through appropriate zoning and land use controls, a competitive environment for telecommunications carriers that does not unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent personal wireless services. This ordinance shall not prohibit, or have the effect of prohibiting, the provision of personal wireless services. This ordinance is intended to promote Harris County as a proactive County in the availability of personal wireless telecommunications service. To that end, this ordinance shall: 
                  (A)  Provide for the appropriate location and development of telecommunications facilities within unincorporated Harris County; 
                  (B)  Protect Harris County's built and natural environment by promoting compatible design standards for telecommunications facilities; 
                  (C)  Minimize adverse visual impacts of telecommunications facilities through careful design, siting, landscape screening and innovative camouflaging techniques; 
                  (D)  Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower or antennas failure through engineering and careful siting of telecommunications tower structures and antennas; 
                  (E)  Maximize use of any new and existing telecommunications towers through colocation so as to minimize the need to construct new towers and minimize the total number of towers throughout the County; 
                  (F)  Maximize and encourage use of alternate telecommunication tower structures as a primary option rather than construction of additional single-use towers; and 
                  (G)  Encourage and promote the location of new telecommunications activities in areas which are not zoned for residential use. 
                  (Ord. No. 06-02, § 1, 8-21-2002)

                  Sec. 4. - Standards applicable to all towers and antennas. 
                  No tower or antenna shall be located in Harris County except as set forth in this Ordinance. The following standards shall apply to all towers and antennas, unless the governing authority reduces the standards if the goals of this Ordinance would be better served thereby: 
                  (A)  Principal or Accessory Use. Antennas and towers may be considered either principal or accessory uses. A different existing use or an existing structure on the same lot shall not preclude the installation of an antenna or tower on such lot. For the purposes of determining whether the installation of a tower or antenna complies with district development regulations, including but not limited to set-back requirements, lot coverage requirements, and other such requirements, the dimensions of the entire lot shall control, even though the antennas or towers may be located on leased parcels within such lots. Towers that are constructed and antennas that are installed in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance shall not be deemed to constitute the expansion of a non-conforming use or structure. 
                  (B)  Inventory of Existing Sites. Each applicant for an antenna and/or tower shall provide to the Planning and Zoning Department an inventory of its existing towers that are either within the geographic area of Harris County or within one-half mile of the border thereof, including specific information about the location, height, and design of each tower. 
                  (C)  Aesthetics; Lighting. The guidelines set forth in this paragraph shall govern the location of all towers, and the installation of all antennas, governed by this Ordinance; provided, however, that the governing authority may waive these requirements if it determines that the goals of this Ordinance are better served thereby. The determination whether a proposed tower or antenna meets these requirements shall be within the discretion of the Harris County Board of Commissioners. This list is not an exclusive list of the aesthetic issues the governing authority may consider; these are merely guidelines. The governing authority may consider any factor that serves the goals and purposes of this Ordinance. 
                  (1)  Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, be painted a neutral color, so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness. 
                  (2)  At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures shall use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and built environment. 
                  (3)  If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible. 
                  (4)  Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the governing authority may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views. No advertising or signage is permitted on telecommunications facilities. 
                  (D)  Federal Requirements. All towers must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed, then the owners of the towers and antennas governed by this Ordinance shall bring such towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six (6) months of the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a more stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal agency. Failure to bring towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at the owner's expense. Any such removal by the governing authority shall be in the manner provided in Sections 41-2-7 through 41-2-17 of the Official Code of Georgia. 
                  (E)  Building Codes; Safety Standards. To ensure the structural integrity of towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries Association, as amended from time to time. If, upon inspection, the governing authority concludes that a tower fails to comply with such codes and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to the owner of the tower, the owner shall have thirty (30) days to bring such tower into compliance with such standards. If the owner fails to bring such tower into compliance within said thirty (30) days, the governing authority may remove such tower at the owner's expense. Any such removal by the governing authority shall be in the manner provided in Sections 41-2-7 through 41-2-17 of the Official Code of Georgia. 
                  (F)  Site location and development shall preserve the preexisting character of the surrounding buildings and land uses and the zoning district as much as possible. Personal wireless telecommunications towers shall be integrated through location and design to blend in with existing characteristics of the site to the extent practical. 
                  (G)  Existing on-site vegetation shall be preserved or improved, and disturbance of the existing topography shall be minimized, unless such disturbance would result in less visual impact of the site to the surrounding area. 
                  (H)  At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower and related facilities to the natural setting and built environment. 
                  (I)  Placement of more than one tower on a lot shall be permitted, provided all set-back, design, and landscape requirements are met as to each tower.

                  Sec. 4. - Powers. 
                  The board of zoning adjustment shall have the following powers: 
                  1.  To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is an error in order, requirement, decision or determination made by an administrative official in the enforcement of this ordinance or of any ordinance adopted pursuant thereto. 
                  2.  In the case of manufactured housing units in place at the time of adoption of this ordinance, to hear and decide variances for the alteration or enlargement of nonconforming structures. This power shall not be exercised in conflict of article VI, section 3 of this ordinance. 
                  3.  To hear and decide variances from the district regulations where by reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness, or shape of a specific piece of property or where by reason of exceptional topographic conditions or other extraordinary or exceptional conditions of a piece of property, the strict application of the district regulations would result in practical difficulties to, or undue hardship upon, the owner of the property, provided that this relief may be granted without substantially impairing the intent and purpose of the zoning ordinances. In granting a variance, the board may attach such conditions regarding the location, character and other features of a proposed building or structure as it may deem advisable to the purpose of the zoning ordinance will be served and the public health, safety and welfare secured. The board shall not have authority to grant a variance of the use or density requirements of the zoning district relating to the property for which a variance is requested. 
                  4.  The board of zoning adjustment does not have the power to rezone. Rezoning is purely a function of the governing authority.

                  In exercising the above-mentioned powers, the board of zoning adjustment may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or determination as ought to be made, and to that end shall have the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken. The concurring vote of three (3) members of the board shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirements, decision or determination of any such administrative official, or to decide in favor of the applicant on any matter upon which it is required to pass under this ordinance, or to effect any variance to the requirement of this ordinance. The board of zoning adjustment shall not be required to return the original papers acted upon by it, but it shall be sufficient to return certified or sworn copies thereof or of such portions thereof as may be called on by such writ. The return shall concisely set forth such other facts as may be pertinent and material to show the grounds of the decision appealed from and shall be verified. 
                  Sec. 5. - Appeals from board of zoning adjustment decision. 
                  Any party aggrieved by any final judgment or decision of such board of zoning adjustment, may within fifteen (15) days thereafter appeal therefrom of the superior court or court of like jurisdiction, by filing with such board a written notice of appeal specifying the judgment or decision from which appeal is taken. In case of such appeal such board shall cause a transcript of the proceedings in the case to be certified to the court to which the appeal is taken and the case in such court to be tried de novo.

                  ARTICLE XI. - GENERAL DESIGN REQUIREMENTS 

                  Sec. 1101. - Suitability of land. 
                  Land subject to flooding, improper drainage, or erosion or land that is for topographical or other reasons unsuitable for residential use shall not be platted for residential use nor for any other use that will continue to increase the danger to health, safety, or property destruction, unless the hazards can be and are corrected prior to final plat approval. No land shall be platted for use which would be in conflict with the identifiable floodplains or other zoning provisions in effect in Harris County. 
                  Sec. 1102. - Name of subdivision. 
                  The name of the subdivision must have the approval of the planning commission. The name shall not duplicate nor closely approximate the name of an existing subdivision in Harris County. 
                  Sec. 1103. - Access. 
                  Subdivisions shall be located so as to gain access over a public street. The street pattern shall be so designed, when required by the Harris County Planning Commission, as to provide two (2) or more means of access from a public street or streets; however, streets converging upon any one point which would tend to promote congestion shall not be permitted. 
                  Sec. 1104. - Access to adjacent properties. 
                  Proposed streets shall be extended by dedication to the boundary of adjacent property where the subdivision is platted with only one (1) access to a public street or where the adjacent property has no access to a public street. Such extension may be required in other instances where, in the opinion of the planning commission, it is desirable to provide street access. 
                  Sec. 1105. - Conformance to adopted major thoroughfare and other plans. 
                  All streets, thoroughfares, and other features of the Major Thoroughfare Plan of Harris County, Georgia, shall be taken into consideration by the subdivider. 
                  When features of other plans adopted by the planning commission (such as schools or other public building sites, parks, or other land for public uses) are located in whole or in part in a land subdivision, such features shall be either dedicated or reserved by the subdivider for acquisition within a reasonable time by the appropriate public agency. 
                  Whenever a plat proposes the dedication of land to public uses that the planning commission finds not required or suitable for such public use, the planning commission shall refuse to approve the plat, and shall notify the governing body of the reasons for such action. 
                  NOTE: One of the primary purposes and advantages of planning for the dedication and reservation of property for public use is to indicate areas which may be presently acquired at acreage prices rather than at greatly increased prices in the future and where future improvements would increase the expense to the taxpayer and create inconvenience for the individual property owner and for the neighborhood.  Where the public use to be made of the property and where the residents of the subdivision will receive primary benefit, the dedication of the property should be encouraged. Where the public use is for the public as a whole, the community should pay proportionately for the acquisition of reserved areas within a reasonable time. A reasonable time is to be determined according to the circumstances, because the subdivider should not be required to hold his land idle for an indefinite period far into the future. 
                  Sec. 1106. - Large-scale developments. 
                  The requirements of these regulations may be modified in the case of a large scale community or planned unit development, such as a housing development or shopping center which is not subdivided into customary lots.

                  Existing streets adjacent to the subdivision shall be continued at the same or greater width, but in no case shall be less than the required width. 
                  Sec. 1202. - Street names. 
                  Street names shall require the approval of the planning commission or its agent. Streets that are obviously in alignment with streets already existing and named shall be given the name of the existing street. Names of new streets shall not duplicate nor closely approximate those of existing streets within Harris County. 
                  Sec. 1203. - Street jogs. 
                  Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than one hundred twenty-five (125) feet shall not be permitted. 
                  Sec. 1204. - Cul-de-sac. 
                  Except where topographic or other conditions make a greater length unavoidable, cul-de-sacs, or dead-end streets, shall not be greater in length than five hundred (500) feet. They shall be provided at the closed end with a turnaround having a property line radius of at least fifty (50) feet with an outside pavement radius of at least forty (40) feet. Temporary turnarounds shall be provided for dead-end streets which are scheduled to be extended at a later date; however, only that portion to be required as right-of-way when the street is continued shall be dedicated and made a public street. 
                  Sec. 1205. - Development along major street, limited-access highway or railroad right-of-way. 
                  Where a subdivision abuts or contains a major street, a limited-access highway or a railroad right-of-way, the planning commission shall require a street approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way either as a marginal-access street, or at a distance suitable for an appropriate use of the intervening land, with a nonaccess reservation. Due regard should be given [to] requirements for approach grades and future grade separations in determining distances. Such lots shall not have access to a major street (or limited-access highway), but only to the access street. 
                  Sec. 1206. - Alleys. 
                  Alleys may be required at the rear of all lots used for multifamily, commercial, or industrial developments. Alleys in residential subdivisions shall not be permitted, unless the subdivider provides evidence satisfactory to the planning commission of the need for alleys. 
                  Sec. 1207. - Streets across dam. 
                  Where a proposed street is to be constructed across a dam, guardrails approved by the director of public works shall be installed on the right-of-way. All lots fronting such a street must have an alternate means of access which does not require traverse of a dam. 
                  Sec. 1208. - Reserve strips. 
                  Reserving [Reserve] strips which control access to streets, alleys, and public grounds shall not be permitted unless their control is placed in the hands of the county. 
                  Sec. 1209. - Easements. 
                  1.  All easements shall run with the land, be perpetual and nonrestrictive, and shall enure to the benefit of the grantee in the easement, his heirs, administrators, executors and assigns.

                  (10)  Maintenance covenant. A covenant recorded in the deed records in the office of the clerk of the superior court shall be required for any private street within a restricted access development. The covenant shall specifically include the following terms: 
                  a.  The covenant shall establish minimum annual assessments in an amount adequate to defray costs of ordinary maintenance and procedures for approval of additional needed assessments. The covenant shall also specify that the funds from such assessments will be held by a homeowners or property owners association in cases of a subdivision fronting on a private street. 
                  b.  The covenant shall include a periodic maintenance schedule. 
                  c.  The covenant for maintenance shall be enforceable by any property owner served by the private street.

                  e.  The covenant shall run with the land. 
                  (11)  Acknowledgment of private streets. Prior to the sale and as a condition of the closing of a real estate transaction involving any lot served by a private street in a restricted access development in Harris County, the subdivider or seller of said lot shall execute a notarized purchaser's acknowledgment of private street construction and drainage maintenance responsibilities set forth below. A copy of the purchaser's acknowledgment shall be retained by the purchaser and shall be required to be submitted as a condition of a building permit for a principal building on said lot: 
                  Purchaser's Acknowledgment of Private Street and Drainage Maintenance Responsibility. 
                  (I)(We) have read the Declaration of Covenant which pertains to the lot that is the subject of this real estate transaction ___________ (insert address or attach legal description). 
                  (I)(We) understand that the Declaration of Covenant applies to the lot that (I am) (we are) purchasing and requires (me)(us) to provide a specified percentage or amount of the financing for the repair and maintenance for any private street and drainage facilities serving the lot which (I am)(we are) purchasing. (I)(We) further understand that the county has no obligation to assist with the maintenance and improvement of the private street, drainage facilities, and other appurtenances within the restricted access development for the private road serving the lot levy purchased. (I)(We) understand that a copy of this purchaser's acknowledgment shall be required as a condition of the issuance of a building permit for a principal building on the lot (I am)(we are) purchasing. 
                  (12)  Annual street assessment. The homeowners association for each restricted access development shall levy and assess each lot owner a sufficient sum of money annually to provide for maintenance and repair of the private streets within the subdivision. Annually, the homeowners association shall provide a certification to the Harris County Board of Commissioners of the status of the account to include the amount levied and collected, the amount held in the account, and the amounts expended for street repair and maintenance. Harris County Board of Commissioners shall have the right to conduct periodic inspections of the streets within the restricted access development. 
                  (13)  Abandonment. In the event that the gatehouse, security gate or electronic entry system is abandoned or ceases to function or to be maintained restricting entry for a period of six (6) consecutive months, or the homeowners association fails to assess or maintain a street repair fund, the roads in the restricted access development shall upon notice from the board of commissioners cease to be utilized as private roads and shall be open for public use. Upon demand from the board of commissioners, the homeowners association shall convey fee simple title to the private streets to Harris County free and clear of all liens, debts or encumbrances along with all street maintenance funds held by the homeowners association. 
                  (14)  Special tax district. For each restricted access subdivision approved under this ordinance there shall be created at the time of approval a special tax district. The special tax district shall encompass and be coterminous with the boundary line of the approved restricted access subdivision. The purpose of the special tax district for the restricted access subdivision is to authorize the Harris County Board of Commissioners to levy a tax upon the property and lots within the subdivision for the repair and improvements of the roads within the restricted access subdivision if the title to the streets become vested in Harris County and are in need of repair. No tax shall be levied unless the owners of the property within the restricted access subdivision or the homeowners association do not comply with the obligation to maintain and repair the private roads and streets within the restricted access development, the development abandons or ceases to function as or be maintained as a restricted access development or fails to assess and maintain an escrow account for future road repair and maintenance and the road becomes a public road as provided for hereunder. 
                  (15)  Commissioners' approval. Prior to issuance of any building permits for the lots within a restricted access development, the restricted access development must be approved by the board of commissioners in compliance with all matters set forth herein.

                  Sec. 1702. - [Waivers authorized.] 
                  Where the planning commission finds that, due to the special circumstances of a particular plat, the provision of certain required improvements is not requisite in the interest of the public health, safety and general welfare or is inappropriate because of inadequacy or lack of connection facilities adjacent or in proximity to the proposed subdivision, it may waive such requirements subject to appropriate conditions. 
                  Sec. 1703. - [Conditions.] 
                  In granting variances and modifications, the planning commission shall require such conditions as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the objectives of the standards or requirements so varied or modified. 
                  Sec. 1704. - Dividing property among immediate family and heirs. 
                  a.  Immediate family. The Harris County Planning and Zoning Administrator shall have the authority to waive the Harris County Subdivision Regulations for special circumstances involving the subdividing of parcels of land to permit the subdivision of land on a private easement road set forth in Section 1210 of this Appendix wherein property is divided and transferred by gift from a property owner to members of his immediate family for the specific purpose of building a permanent residence for the donee family member. This authorization shall be limited solely to a property given to a landowner's immediate family which shall consist of spouse, children, grandchildren, parents, grandparents, siblings, nieces and nephews. The number of subdivided lots shall not exceed six (6) and must have a minimum lot size of five (5) acres; provided, further, a subdivision of land among family on a private easement road as provided for herein shall not constitute a major subdivision as defined in Section 301, n, Subdivision, major, of Article III. Definitions of Certain Terms Used in Subdivision Regulations, but shall be deemed to be a minor subdivision as defined in Section 301, o, Subdivision, minor. The subdivided lots shall not be for resale or for speculation upon completion of a dwelling and shall not be subdivided again for a period of five (5) years. In the event that the request for subdivision among family members is disapproved by the planning and zoning administrator, the decision denying such may be appealed to the Harris County Planning Commission within thirty (30) days of the denial. Any request for more than six (6) lots shall be reviewed by the planning and zoning administrator and then submitted to the Harris County Planning Commission with comments and recommendations for final determination. 
                  b.  Heirs. The Harris County Planning and Zoning Administrator shall have the authority to waive the Harris County Subdivision Regulations under special circumstances of a particular plat involving the subdividing of parcels of land where probated personal Last Wills and Testaments dictate the dividing of property among heirs. In special circumstances of this nature, there shall be no more than one dwelling house on a five (5) acre or less parcel of land and no more than six (6) parcels may front on a private easement road. In the event that the request for subdivision among heirs is disapproved by the planning and zoning administrator, the decision denying such may be appealed to the Harris County Planning Commission within thirty (30) days of the denial. Any request for more than six (6) lots shall be reviewed by the planning and zoning administrator and then submitted to the Harris County Planning Commission with comments and recommendations for final determination.

                  The Harris County Planning and Zoning Administrator shall have the authority to approve subdivision of property on an easement as provided for in Section 1209 of this Appendix where the creation of an easement is for the purpose of property division among family members (i.e. for property distribution to heirs through estate settlement). This section is intended to provide flexibility in preventing the creation of land locked properties situations where property is distributed among family members and not with the intention to provide an exemption to the requirement that all property front on public roads and not with the intention to provide an exemption to facilitate commercial subdivision development on private easement roads. In the event that the request for subdivision among family members is disapproved by the planning and zoning administrator, the decision denying such may be appealed to the Harris County Planning Commission within thirty (30) days of the denial.

Appointments may be made above the minimum rate when such action is determined to be necessary in the best interest of the County. Approval will be based on such conditions as: shortage of qualified applicants available; qualifications of the applicant being in excess of the requirements for the class. When a Department Head wishes to hire a new employee at a salary higher than the minimum for that classification, he/she may submit a written request for a percentage increase to the County Manager. The request must include justification for an increased starting salary, such as exceptional qualifications relating to education, training, or experience. The County Manager is authorized to approve an increase up to 5% of the minimum salary for that classification. A request for over a 5% increase of the minimum salary for that classification must be approved by the Board of Commissioners. 
                  Section 3. - Promotions. 
                  When an employee is promoted his/her salary shall be adjusted to the new range which will effect an increase in salary. The County Manager is authorized to approve up to a 5% increase in salary due to promotions, as long as the increase does not cause the salary line to go over budget nor exceed the maximum salary for the position. 
                  Section 4. - Demotions. 
                  When an employee is demoted, he/she shall be paid at a rate which is within the approved range for the lower class position. The rate of pay shall be recommended by the Department Head and approved by the County Manager, taking into consideration the circumstances necessitating the demotion. 
                  Section 5. - Transfers. 
                  When an employee requests a transfer from one department to another, and/or from one job classification to another, the employee's salary will be set at the minimum salary for the new classification; provided however, that if the Department Head receiving the transferring employee requests higher than the starting salary, a request must be submitted in the same manner as a new employee. The County Manager is authorized to approve an increase up to 5% of the minimum salary for that classification. 
                  Section 6. - Reappointments.

                  Section 7. - Part-time employment. 
                  When employment is on a part-time basis, the appropriate hourly rate of pay shall be paid for the hours worked. 
                  Section 8. - Overtime. 
                  Overtime worked shall include only that work performed by employees at the direction of a Department Head or an authorized representative which exceeds the number of hours constituting both the established work day and work week or period of the shifts involved. Employees who work overtime without advance oral or written approval shall face disciplinary action as outlined in Chapter X. 
                  Section 9. - Salary adjustments. 
                  A.  Annual Increases: At the beginning of each fiscal year, the minimum, mid-point, and maximum salaries will be adjusted upward if funding is available, as decided upon by the Board of Commissioners. All salary increases will be based on the employees' Performance Appraisal score, except that there could be an additional increase if the salary range for all classifications is adjusted upward by the Board of Commissioners. Percentages of increase will be determined annually, and increases will be based on funding available, as decided by the Board of Commissioners. After an employee has reached maximum salary, there will be no further annual increase in salary, unless the salary range for all classifications is adjusted upward by the Board of Commissioners. 
                  B.  Cost of Living Increases: The County Commission may grant an across-the-board cost of living increase at any time it is warranted and funds are available to support the increase. A cost of living increase will cause each increment on the pay schedule to be increased accordingly, at the discretion of the [Commission]. Cost of living increases will not prevent an employee from receiving-annual-increases. 
                  C.  Promotion Increase. When an employee is promoted his/her salary shall be adjusted to the new range which will effect an increase in salary. (See Chapter IV, Section 3.) 
                  D.  Demotion Adjustment. When an employee is demoted, he/she shall be paid at a rate which is within the range for the lower class position. (See Chapter IV, Section 4.) 
                  E.  Transfer Adjustment. When an employee is transferred, his/her salary shall be set at the minimum salary for the new job classification; provided, however, that the Department Head receiving the employee may request a higher than starting salary. (See Chapter IV, Section 5.) 
                  F.  Pay Plan Update: When justified by a comprehensive study of internal and external factors affecting pay rates for classes of jobs, an employee's salary may be increased to the amount closest to his/her current salary as a result of the findings of such a study. 
                  Section 10. - Maintenance. 
                  The County Manager shall annually evaluate the effectiveness of the pay plan and recommend necessary revisions to the County Commission. The following will be considered in the evaluation: 
                  1.  Rates for similar positions paid by other units of government in neighboring areas; 
                  2.  Pay for like work paid by private industry in the area serviced by this government; 
                  3.  Maintaining appropriate differentials between classifications; 
                  4.  Other factors as appropriate.

                  A.  The Department Head may disqualify an applicant who does not meet the requirements for the position.

                  Section 1. - Objective. 
                  The working test period shall be regarded as an integral part of the selection process and shall be utilized for closely observing the employee's work, for securing the most effective adjustment of a new employee to his/her position, and for rejecting any employee whose performance is not satisfactory. 
                  Section 2. - Duration. 
                  The working test period shall be six (6) months in duration.

                  Section 5. - Dismissal. 
                  During the working test period, the Department Head may remove an employee who is unable or unwilling to perform the duties of the position satisfactorily or whose habits and dependability do not merit his/her continuance in the service.

                  B.  Upon promotion of an employee into a higher pay classification, subject employee shall be eligible to receive up to 5% above the salary employee is current making upon approval by the County Manager as long as the increase does not cause the salary line to go over budget nor exceed the maximum salary for the position.

                  A transfer of an employee from one department to another shall have the approval of both Department Heads concerned and the County Manager. Requests for such transfers shall show how the employee meets the qualification requirements of the class to which the transfer is proposed. 
                  Section 3. - Demotions. 
                  Involuntary demotions occur in instances of inadequate performance, reduction in workload or workforce, or for disciplinary purposes. Any such recommendation must be documented by the immediate supervisor. 
                  CHAPTER IX. - EMPLOYEE PERFORMANCE EVALUATION 

                  Section 1. - Objective. 
                  The primary purpose of the employee performance evaluation shall be to inform employees of the quality of their work and to communicate areas needing improvement. The performance evaluation may also be used in determining a salary increment; as a factor in determining order of layoff; as a basis for training, promotion, demotion, transfer or dismissal; and for such other purposes as set forth in these regulations. 
                  Section 2. - Evaluation process. 
                  A.  Employees, except those in temporary status, shall receive a verbal evaluation by their immediate supervisor prior to completion of six (6) months of service and annually thereafter.

                  B.  The report of unsatisfactory performance shall be discussed directly with the employee. If an employee disagrees with any statement in the evaluation, they may submit within ten (10) days following the conference with their supervisor a written statement with a copy forwarded to the County Manager to be placed in the employee's file or for further action.

                  Section 1. - Resignation. 
                  An employee should give at least fourteen (14) calendar days prior notice of intention to resign to his immediate supervisor. Failure to comply with this rule shall be entered on the service record of the employee and may result in a denial of re-employment rights. Exceptional circumstances may warrant exemption from penalty. 
                  Section 2. - Abandonment of position. 
                  An employee who, without valid reason, fails to report to work for three (3) consecutive work days without authorized leave shall be separated from the payroll and reported as having abandoned his/her position. Such an employee is not eligible for re-employment and shall be paid only for unused annual leave. 
                  Section 3. - Reduction in force and lay-off. 
                  A.  It shall be the prerogative of the County Commission to abolish job positions, to reduce the salary of personnel (hereinafter "to downgrade"), to reduce the number of employees, and/or to transfer or to demote employees when seeking to cope effectively with changes in county services or in the event of financial exigency. 
                  B.  The County Commission shall consider a Reduction in Force (hereinafter "RIF") to include the abolition of job positions, the downgrading of an employee's position and pay, the transfer to a different job or the demotion, and/or the reduction of the number of employees, as a response to the following: 
                  1.  A decrease in need or use of any County service which would necessitate a decrease in personnel or a discontinuation of any County service, in whole or in part; 
                  2.  A failure to appropriate necessary funding, the decrease in funding or a change in federal, state or local funding or a change in financial practices which would necessitate a change in or elimination of any services provided by Harris County; 
                  3.  Any reorganization plan to achieve a more efficient or economic delivery of county services. 
                  4.  Any involuntary separation not involving delinquency, misconduct, or inefficiency shall be considered as a RIF. 
                  C.  When the County Manager or the County Commission determines that the application of this reduction in force policy is necessary, it shall be the primary responsibility of the County Manager to prepare for presentation to the County Commission a plan for RIF in the affected area(s) of county services. In developing a RIF plan, the County Manager shall make all reasonable efforts to ensure that a reduction in force does not reduce the quality of services in the County. In making RIF recommendations, the County Manager may consider any position or employee of the County. 
                  D.  Factors to be considered by the County Manager in devising a RIF plan shall include an employee's service in class, length of service with the County, and the average performance rating for the last three years. Once a comparative assessment of employees has been completed, the County Manager shall prepare and present a plan for reduction in force for approval and action by the County Commission. 
                  1.  When an employee possesses a critical skill essential to the efficient operation of a department, the employee may be retained in preference to a person with a higher rating. Documentation and request for such action must be presented to the County Manager for presentation to the County Commissioners who will make the final decision. The request shall set forth in detail the specific skills and abilities possessed by the individual and the reasons why such individual is essential to the effective operation of the department. 
                  E.  If the County Commission acts at the recommendation of the County Manager for a RIF, the County Manager shall notify the affected employee and the employee shall have whatever rights the Harris County Policy provides for such employee.

Such employees shall not have any priority in re-employment by virtue of the RIF. 
                  Section 4. - Disability. 
                  A Department Head may direct any employee under his/her jurisdiction to be examined by a physician designated by the County. When a disability of any kind impairs the effectiveness of an employee or others, the Department Head, subject to the approval of the County Commission, shall take such action to either accommodate and retain the employee with a disability or terminate such employee consistent with State and Federal law. 
                  Section 5. - Dismissals. 
                  A.  Dismissals are discharges or separations made for definable cause, as set out in Chapter X, Section 2.

Failure of an employee to comply with furnishing the medical certificate may lead to disciplinary action, as outlined in Chapter X. 
                  7.  Medical Certificate Required.
