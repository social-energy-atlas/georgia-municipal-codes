PREFACE 
</p>
        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Garden City, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1976 Code, as supplemented through January 1983, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1976 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Palmer Carr, Supervising Editor, and Connie Timmons, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Kimberly S. Kaminsky, Code Enforcement Officer, and Mr. James P. Gerard, City Attorney, for their cooper-ation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

SUPPLEMENT HISTORY TABLE 
The table below allows users of this Code to quickly and accurately determine what ordinances have been considered for codification in each supplement. Ordinances that are of a general and permanent nature are codified in the Code Book and are considered "Included." Ordinances that are not of a general and permanent nature are not codified in the Code Book and are considered "Omitted."

                  Editor's note— Printed herein is the city's Charter as set forth in 1973 Ga. Laws, page 3581. Amendments to the Charter are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original Charter. Obvious misspellings have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes, a uniform system of capitalization, spelling, style of numbers, citations to state statutes and style of headings and catchlines has been used. Additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets.

                  Sec. 2-42. - Preservation of order and decorum. 
                  (a)  During council meetings, councilmembers shall neither by conversation or otherwise delay or interrupt the proceedings, nor refuse to obey the orders of the mayor or the rules of the council. Every councilman desiring to speak shall address the chair and, upon recognition by the mayor, shall confine himself to the question under debate and shall avoid all personalities and indecorous language. Every councilman desiring to question the administrative staff shall address his question to the mayor, who shall be entitled either to answer the inquiries himself or to designate some member of his staff for that purpose. A councilman, once recognized, shall not be interrupted while speaking unless called to order by the mayor or unless a point of order is raised by another member, or unless the speaker chooses to yield to questions from another member. If a councilman is called to order while he is speaking, he shall cease speaking immediately until the question of order is determined. If ruled to be in order, he shall be permitted to proceed. If ruled to be not in order, he shall remain silent or shall alter his remarks so as to comply with rules of the council. All members of the council shall accord the utmost courtesy to each other, to city employees and to members of the public appearing before the council, and shall refrain at all times from rude and derogatory remarks, reflections as to integrity, abusive comments and statements as to motives and personalities. Councilmen shall confine their questions to the particular matters before the assembly and in debate shall confine their remarks to the issues before the council. Members shall be removed from the meeting for failure to comply with decisions of the mayor or for continued violations of the rules of the council. If the mayor fails to act, any member may move to require him to enforce the rules, and affirmative vote of a majority of the council shall require the mayor to act. 
                  (b)  Members of the administrative staff and employees of the city shall observe the same rules of procedure and decorum applicable to members of the council. Any nonmember of the council desiring to address the council shall be recognized by the chair, shall state his name for the record, and shall limit his remarks to the matter under discussion. All remarks and questions addressed to the council shall be addressed to the council as a whole and not to any individual member thereof. No staff member other than the staff member having the floor shall enter into any discussion either directly or indirectly without permission of the mayor. 
                  (c)  Members of the public attending council meetings also shall observe the same rules of propriety, decorum and good conduct applicable to members of the council. Any person making personal, impertinent and slanderous remarks or who becomes boisterous while addressing the council or while attending a council meeting shall be removed from the room at the direction of the mayor, and such person shall be barred from further audience before the council. Unauthorized remarks from the audience, stamping of feet, whistles, yells and similar demonstrations shall not be permitted by the mayor, who shall direct the removal of such offenders from the room. Aggravated cases shall be prosecuted on appropriate complaint signed by the mayor. In case the mayor shall fail to act, any member of the council may move to require him to act to enforce the rules, and the affirmative vote of the majority of the council shall require the mayor to act.

                  A member of the council, having spoken once on the original question, may be permitted to speak again only: 
                  (1)  To clear a matter of fact; 
                  (2)  To explain himself in some material part of his speech; or 
                  (3)  With regard to the matter of words of the question, keeping himself to these only, and not going into the merits of it, and not falling into the matter itself. 
                  On an amendment being moved, a member who has spoken to the main question may speak again to the amendment.

If the appeal is seconded, the member making the appeal may briefly state his reason for the appeal, and the mayor may briefly explain his ruling, but there shall be no debate on the appeal and no other member shall participate in the discussion. The mayor shall then put the question, "Shall the appeal be sustained?" If a majority of the members present vote "aye," the ruling of the chair is overruled.

                  Sec. 2-50. - Motion to adjourn.

                  (3)  When the previous question has been ordered; and 
                  (4)  While a vote is being taken.

                  Sec. 2-51. - Motion to lay on the table. 
                  A motion before the council to lay on the table shall preclude all amendments or debate of the subject under consideration.

                  (Code 1976, § 2-1046) 
                  Sec. 2-52. - Moving the previous question. 
                  When the previous question is moved at a council meeting, and seconded by one other member, it shall be put as follows: "Shall the main question be now put?" There shall then be no further amendment or debate, but, following an affirmative vote, pending amendments shall be put in their order before the main question. If the question "Shall the main question be now put" be decided in the negative, the main question remains before the council.

                  Sec. 2-54. - Amendments. 
                  (a)  It shall be in order for the council to amend an ordinance at any time when not in the hands of a committee. 
                  (b)  On an amendment to strike out and insert, the paragraph to be amended shall first be read as it stands, then the words proposed to be stricken out and those to be inserted shall be read, and finally the paragraph as it would stand if so amended shall be read. 
                  (c)  An amendment modifying the intention of a motion shall be in order, but an amendment relating to a different matter shall not be in order.

A motion to reconsider shall require the same number of votes as is required to adopt an ordinance or resolution. After a motion for reconsideration has once been acted on, no other motion for a reconsideration thereof shall be made without unanimous consent.

                  A motion before the council to consider an ordinance at the first meeting where it is originally introduced shall be debatable, and upon unanimous passage of such motion the main question shall be open to debate.

                  Sec. 2-59. - Special orders. 
                  It shall require the consent of a majority of the members present at a council meeting to make any subject a special order.

                  Sec. 2-60. - Unsigned communications.

                  Sec. 2-61. - Tie votes. 
                  In the case of a tie vote of the council where the mayor's vote does not break the tie, the proposal shall be considered lost.

                  Sec. 2-62. - Rules of order generally. 
                  (a)  Every question of order at a council meeting shall be decided by the chair without debate, subject to an appeal of the council, and the chair may call for the consent of the council on any question of order. If repeated calls do not produce order, the member is to be called by name. 
                  (b)  Where the private interests of a member are concerned in a question, he is to withdraw, and when such an interest has appeared his voice is to be disallowed. 
                  (c)  No motion shall be debated or put until the motion is seconded. It is then, and not until then, in possession of council, and cannot be withdrawn but by leave of council. 
                  (d)  When a proposition is moved which is useless or inexpedient, the previous question is introduced for suppressing, for that time, the motion and its discussion, in which case the main question is to be put immediately without any further debate, and in the form in which it then exists; but, as the previous question applies that day only, and it may recur again, if it is desired to suppress entirely, the motion shall be to postpone indefinitely. 
                  (e)  When a proper motion is made, but information wanted, the motion is to postpone to a day certain. 
                  (f)  When a matter is introduced claiming present attention, but which it is desired to reserve for a more suitable occasion, the order is to lay on the table, and it may then be called for at any time. If the proposition or matter needs further consideration, the order shall be to refer to a committee, but if it needs but a few and simple amendments, the council shall proceed to consider and amend it at once. 
                  (g)  On motion to amend an ordinance, any member may move to commit it or refer it to a committee, and the question for commitment shall be first put. An amendment to an amendment is admitted, but to amend an amendment to an amendment is not. 
                  (h)  The question is to be put first on the affirmative and then on the negative side. 
                  (i)  When a question has been moved and seconded, and been put by the chair in the affirmative and negative, it becomes a full question, and cannot be debated afterwards, unless under motion for reconsideration. 
                  (j)  The consequences of a measure may be reprobated in strong terms, but to arraign the motives of those who propose or advocate it is a personality and against order. 
                  (k)  Any member shall be heard at any time on a matter of personal privilege, and such request to be heard shall be given precedence.

                  (9)  The plan of the concert or special event as proposed is likely to require the diversion of so many public employees that allowing the event would unreasonably deny services to the remainder of the city. 
                  (10)  The plan of the concert or special event as proposed is likely to require the diversion of so great a number of ambulances that allowing the event would unreasonably deny services to the remainder of the city

                  (b)  After the meeting, city manager may affirm or revoke the chief of police's decision with respect to denial of the permit and may affirm, modify or waive those conditions of approval which, in its opinion, are impractical or would result in severe hardship to the applicant; provided, however, that the provisions of Code Sections 11.4(a)(1) and (2), herein cannot be waived.

No permit shall issue until all charges and fees have been paid in full. 
                  (d)  Cessation of work. Upon notice from the city administrator or the building inspector, work on any building, structure, system, or component therein, that is being done contrary to the provisions of the state minimum standard codes, or in a dangerous or unsafe manner, or in violation of any other applicable law, rule, or regulation, shall immediately cease. Such notice shall be given in writing, directed to the owner of the property and to the person doing the work, and shall state the conditions under which work may be resumed. Where an emergency situation exists, the city administrator or the building inspector shall not be required to give a written notice prior to stopping the work. 
                  (e)  Revocation of permit for false statement or misrepresentation. The city administrator may revoke a permit or approval issued under the provisions of this chapter in the event he finds there has been a false statement or misrepresentation as to any material fact in the application or plans under which the permit or approval was based. The city administrator may also revoke a permit upon determining that the construction, erection, alternation, repair, moving, or demolition of the building or structure for which the permit was issued is in violation of, or not in conformity with, the provisions of the state minimum standard code, provided, the work was stopped in accordance with section 18-4(d) and the permitee has not met the conditions for resuming the work after a reasonable period for compliance has been granted. 
                  (f)  Penalty for Commencing Construction Without Permit. Where work for which a building permit is required by this chapter is started or proceeded without obtaining the necessary permit, the fees specified or authorized in this chapter shall be doubled, but the payment of such double fee shall not relieve any person from fully complying with the requirements of this chapter in the execution of the work or from any other penalties as prescribed. 
                  (g)  Reinspection fees. A fee set by mayor and council from time to time may be assessed for situations that require an inspector to make an additional visit to the building site including the failure to cancel an inspection when work is not ready, when work is incomplete, or when required corrections are not made.

                  Sec. 18-150. - Purpose. 
                  This article is designed and intended to balance the interests of the residents of the city, telecommunications providers, and telecommunications customers in the siting of telecommunications facilities within the city so as to protect the health, safety and integrity of residential neighborhoods and foster, through appropriate zoning and land use controls, a competitive environment for telecommunications carriers that does not unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent personal wireless services and shall not prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services, and so as to promote the city as a proactive city in the availability of personal wireless telecommunications services. To that end, this article shall: 
                  (1)  Provide for the appropriate location and development of telecommunications facilities in the city; 
                  (2)  Protect the city's built and natural environment by promoting compatible design standards for telecommunications facilities; 
                  (3)  Minimize adverse visual impacts of telecommunications facilities through careful design, siting, landscape screening and innovated camouflaging techniques; 
                  (4)  Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower or antennae failure through engineering and careful siting of telecommunications tower structures and antennae; 
                  (5)  Maximize use of any new and existing telecommunications towers so as to minimize the need to construct new towers and minimize the total number of towers throughout the city; 
                  (6)  Maximize and encourage use of alternative telecommunication tower structures as a primary option rather than construction of additional single-use towers; and 
                  (7)  Encourage and promote the location of new telecommunications facilities in areas which are not zoned for residential use. 
                  (Ord. of 10-6-97, § 1) 
                  Sec. 18-151. - Definitions.

                  (Ord. of 10-6-97, § 1) 
                  Sec. 18-153. - Placement of telecommunications facilities by zoning district. 
                  (a)  In light industrial (I-1) and heavy industrial (I-2) zoning districts, micro and macro telecommunications facilities shall be allowed as a use by right. Telecommunications towers designed and intended to accommodate at least one user are permitted as a use of right up to a height of 80 feet following design review by and receipt of a building permit from the building inspector. Telecommunications towers designed and intended to accommodate at least two users are permitted as a use of right up to a height of 100 feet following design review by and receipt of a building permit from the building inspector. Telecommunications towers designed and intended to accommodate at least two users are permitted as a use of right up to a height of 100 feet following design review by and receipt of a building permit from the building inspector. 
                  (b)  In commercial (C-1 and C-2) zoning districts micro and macro telecommunications facilities shall be allowed as a use by right following design review by and receipt of a building permit from the building inspector. Monopole towers up to a height of 50 feet are permitted as a special use following design review by and receipt of a building permit from the building inspector and monopole towers up at a height of 80 feet designed and intended to accommodate at least two users are permitted as a special use following design review by and receipt of a building permit from the building inspector.

Monopole towers up to a height of 50 feet are permitted as a special use following design review by and receipt of a building permit from the building inspector. 
                  (d)  In single-family residential (R-1) and planned unit development (PUD) zoning districts, micro telecommunications facilities shall be allowed as a use as of right on nonresidential structures following design review by and receipt of a building permit from the building inspector. Macro telecommunications facilities shall be allowed as a special use on nonresidential structures following design review by and receipt of a building permit from the building inspector. 
                  (e)  Telecommunications facilities outside the guidelines listed above may only be built after approval of a variance in accordance with section 90-213 of this Code as well as receipt of a building permit. 
                  (Ord. of 10-6-97, § 1) 
                  Sec. 18-154. - Preferred and disfavored location sites. 
                  (a)  Preferred location sites. 
                  (1)  Co-location sites. Any existing telecommunications towers currently being used for transmitting or receiving analog, digital, microwave, cellular, telephone, personal wireless service or similar forms of electronic communication shall be a preferred location site regardless of the underlying zoning designation of the site; provided, however, that locations which meet this criteria shall be subject to the design and siting components of this article and co-location sites shall not become an "antenna farm" or otherwise be deemed by the building inspector or the governing authority to be visually obtrusive. 
                  (2)  Publicly-used structures. Publicly-used structures are preferred locations throughout the city because they appear in virtually all neighborhoods, are dispersed throughout the city, and due to their institutional or infrastructure uses are generally similar in appearance to or readily adaptable for telecommunications facilities. Therefore, telecommunications facilities should be less noticeable when placed on publicly-used structures than when placed on commercial or residential structures. Publicly-used structures include, but are not limited to, facilities such as police or fire stations, libraries, community centers, civic centers, courthouses, utility structures, water towers, elevated roadways, bridges, flag poles, schools, hospitals, clocks or bell towers, light poles and churches. 
                  (3)  Industrial and commercial structures. Wholly industrial and commercial structures such as warehouses, factories, retail outlets, supermarkets, banks, garages, or service stations shall be preferred locations particularly where existing visual obstruction or clutter on the roof or along a roofline can and will be removed as part of the installation of the telecommunications facility. 
                  (4)  Mixed use buildings in high density districts. Mixed use buildings (housing above commercial or other nonresidential space) are also preferred location sites. 
                  (b)  Disfavored location sites. Any single-family residential structure or site or multi-family duplex shall be a disfavored site for the location of telecommunications facilities. 
                  (Ord. of 10-6-97, § 1) 
                  Sec. 18-155. - Requirements for telecommunications facilities. 
                  (a)  General requirements for all telecommunications facilities. The requirements set forth in this section shall govern the location and construction of all telecommunications facilities governed by this article. 
                  (1)  Building code and safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity of telecommunications facilities, the owner of a telecommunications facility shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes and the applicable standards for such telecommunications facilities, as amended from time to time. Owners of telecommunications facilities shall conduct periodic inspections of such facilities at least once every year to ensure structural integrity. Inspections shall be conducted by a qualified, independent engineer licensed to practice in the state. The results of such inspection shall be provided to the building inspector. 
                  (2)  Regulatory compliance. 
                  a.  All telecommunications facilities must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC and any other agency of the state or federal government with the authority to regulate telecommunications facilities. If such standards and regulations are changed then the owners of the telecommunications facilities governed by this article shall bring such telecommunications facilities into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within the date established by the agency promulgating the standards or regulations. 
                  b.  Owners of telecommunications facilities shall provide documentation showing that each telecommunications facility is in compliance with all applicable federal and state requirements. Evidence of compliance must be submitted every 12 months. 
                  (3)  Security. All telecommunications facilities shall be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device or other similar protective device to prevent unauthorized access to the telecommunications facility. 
                  (4)  Lighting. No illumination is permitted on telecommunications facilities unless required by the FCC, FAA or other state or federal agency of competent jurisdiction or unless necessary for air traffic safety. If lighting is required or necessary, the building inspector may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding uses and views. 
                  (5)  Advertising. No advertising is permitted on telecommunications facilities. However, a whip antenna may be allowed on any legally permitted permanent billboard or outdoor advertising sign as long as the other requirements of this article are met. 
                  (6)  Visual impact. 
                  a.  Telecommunications facilities shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA or other applicable federal or state agency, be painted a neutral color or painted and/or textured to match the existing structure so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness. 
                  b.  If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and associated electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible. Roof-mounted antennas shall be made visually unobtrusive by screening to match existing air conditioning units, stairs, elevator towers or other background. 
                  c.  Where feasible, telecommunications facilities should be placed directly above, below or incorporated with vertical design elements of a building to help in camouflaging. 
                  d.  Telecommunications facilities shall not be placed in a direct line of sight with historic or scenic view corridors as designated by the governing body or by any state or federal law or agency. 
                  e.  Any equipment shelter or cabinet that supports telecommunications facilities must be concealed from public view or made compatible with the architecture of the surrounding structures or placed underground. Equipment shelters or cabinets shall be screened from public view by using landscaping or materials and colors consistent with the surrounding backdrop. The shelter or cabinet must be regularly maintained. 
                  (7)  Landscaping. 
                  a.  Landscaping shall be used to effectively screen the view of the telecommunications facility from adjacent public ways, public property and residential property. 
                  b.  Native vegetation on the site shall be preserved to the greatest practical extent. The applicant shall provide a site plan showing existing significant vegetation to be removed, and vegetation to be replanted to replace that lost. 
                  c.  The building inspector may waive or modify the landscaping requirement where lesser requirements are desirable for adequate visibility for security purposes, for continued operation of existing bona fide agricultural or forest uses such as farms, nurseries and tree farms or where an antenna is placed on an existing structure. In certain locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, such as remote agricultural or rural locations or developed heavy industrial areas, the landscaping requirement may be modified or waived by the building inspector. 
                  (8)  Maintenance impacts. Equipment at a transmission facility shall be automated to the greatest extent possible to reduce traffic and congestion. Where the site abuts or has access to a collector or local street, access for maintenance vehicles shall be exclusively by means of the collector or local street. 
                  (9)  Principal, accessory and joint uses. 
                  a.  Accessory structures used in direct support of a telecommunications facility shall be allowed but not be used for offices, vehicle storage or other outdoor storage. Mobile or immobile equipment not used in direct support of a telecommunications facility shall not be stored or parked on the site of the telecommunications facility. 
                  b.  Telecommunications facilities may be located on sites containing another principal use in the same buildable area. 
                  (10)  Lot size and setbacks. 
                  a.  The following setback requirements shall apply to all telecommunications facilities, provided, however, that the building inspector may reduce the standard setback requirements of this section if the goals of this article would be better served thereby. 
                  1.  Telecommunications towers must be set back a distance equal to the height of the tower from any off-site residential structure. 
                  2.  Towers, guy wires and accessory facilities must satisfy the minimum zoning district setback requirements. 
                  3.  Telecommunications facilities must be setback from any property line a sufficient distance to protect adjoining property from the potential impact of telecommunications facility failure by being large enough to accommodate such failure on the site, based on the engineer's analysis required in section 18-156. 
                  b.  For antennas attached to the roof or a supporting structure on a rooftop, a 1:1 setback ratio (example: a ten-foot high antenna and supporting structure requires a ten-foot setback from the edge of the roof) shall be maintained unless an alternative placement is shown to reduce visual impact. 
                  (b)  Additional requirements for towers. 
                  (1)  Site location and development shall preserve the preexisting character of the surrounding buildings and land uses and the zone district as much as possible. Personal wireless telecommunication towers shall be integrated through location and design to blend in with existing characteristics of the site to the extent practical. 
                  (2)  Existing on-site vegetation shall be preserved or improved, and disturbance of the existing topography shall be minimized, unless such disturbance would result in less visual impact of the site to the surrounding area. 
                  (3)  At a tower site the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower and related facilities to the natural setting and built environment. 
                  (4)  Towers shall not be located any closer than 1,500 feet from an existing tower unless technologically required or visually preferable. 
                  (5)  When a tower is adjacent to a residential use, it must be set back from the nearest residential lot line a distance of at least equal to its total height. 
                  (6)  In no case shall a tower be located in the required front yard, back yard or side yard in a residential district. 
                  (7)  Towers shall not be sited where they will negatively affect historic or scenic view corridors as designated by the governing body or any state or federal law or agency or where they will create visual clutter. 
                  (8)  Towers shall be enclosed by decay-resistant security fencing not less than six feet in height and shall be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device or other similar protective device designed to prevent tower access. 
                  (9)  Placement of more than one tower on a lot shall be permitted, provided all setback, design and landscape requirements are met as to each tower. Structures may be located as close to each other as technically feasible, provided tower failure characteristics of the towers on the site will not lead to multiple failures in the event that one fails.

The applicant shall provide a drawing for each tower showing existing and proposed antennae locations. The applicant shall also describe any limitations on the ability of the tower to accommodate other uses, e.g., radio frequency interference, mass height, frequency or other characteristics. The applicant shall describe the technical options available to overcome those limitations and reasons why the technical options considered were not chosen to be incorporated. The building inspector shall approve those limitations if they cannot be overcome by reasonable technical means. 
                  e.  The applicant must provide a utilities inventory showing the locations of all water, sewage, drainage and power lines impacting the proposed tower site. 
                  (4)  Other information requested. The applicant must provide any other information which may be requested by the building inspector to fully evaluate and review the application and the potential impact of a proposed telecommunications facility. 
                  (b)  Expedited review for building permits only. When a telecommunications facility will be a use as of right pursuant to section 18-153 of this article and requires only a building permit and design review before it may be erected, the building inspector will expedite review of the application and render a decision on the application within ten business days after receipt of a complete application. 
                  (c)  Special use permits. 
                  (1)  A request for a special use permit shall be initiated by application to the building inspector. The board of zoning appeals may then issue a special use permit under this section provided the building inspector shall have determined that all of the requirements of section 18-155 have been satisfied and, further, that the benefits of and need for the proposed tower are greater than any possible depreciating effects and damage to the neighboring properties. 
                  (2)  In granting a special use permit, the board of zoning appeals may impose additional zoning conditions to the extent determined necessary to buffer or otherwise minimize adverse effects of the proposed tower or antenna on surrounding properties.

                  (a)  All occupation taxes levied hereunder are levied on the amount of business to be transacted during the current calendar year; however, for the convenience of both the city and the taxpayer, each business subject to the occupation tax levied in section 22-29 shall, on or before the dates hereinafter set forth, file with the city administrator the return hereinafter specifically provided for, showing the gross receipts of that business during the preceding calendar year. This return shall be used as the basis for making estimated payments on the occupation tax for the current calendar year. The actual and final amount of tax levied for business transacted in the current calendar year shall be paid in accordance with a final return to be made after the end of the year, in accordance with the procedure set forth herein. In the case of a business subject to occupation tax for a calendar year, which has not conducted for any period of time in the corporate limits of the city in the preceding year, the owner, proprietor, manager or executive officer of the business liable for occupation tax shall estimate the gross volume of revenue from commencing date to the end of the calendar year and such tax shall be paid as provided in section 22-36. 
                  (b)  The owner, proprietor, manager, or secretary officer of the business subject to such occupation tax of the current calendar year shall, at the end of the preceding year, and on or before April 1 of the current calendar year, file with the city a signed return setting forth the amount of gross receipts of such business for the entire preceding calendar year. This return will be used to determine the final tax for the calendar year just completed and as an estimate of the gross receipts and occupation tax for the current year. 
                  (c)  Where a business subject to the occupation tax for the calendar year has been conducted for only a part of the preceding year, the amount of gross receipts for such part shall be reported in such return. Such return shall also show a figure putting the receipts for such part of a year on an annual basis with the part-year receipts bearing the same ratio to the whole-year gross receipts as the part-year bears to the whole year. Such figure shall be used as the estimate of the gross receipts of the business for the current calendar year in establishing the business tax liability.

                  (b)  If the amount of the occupation tax for the preceding year based on the return provided for in this section and on the rate of such tax provided for in this article is more than the amount of occupation tax theretofore paid by such business based on the estimate filed pursuant to section 22-47, the difference in such amount shall be due and payable by the taxpayer to the city on May 1 of the current year and delinquent if not paid on or before such date. 
                  (c)  If the amount of the occupation tax for the preceding year based on the return provided for in this section and on the rate of such tax provided for in this article is less than the amount of occupation tax theretofore paid by such business based on the estimate filed pursuant to section 22-47, the difference in such amount shall be refundable by the city to the taxpayer; or, if such business continues to be conducted in the city during the current year, such difference in amount may be credited by the city on the amount of occupation tax to be paid to the city by such business for the current year. This election is to be taken by the city.

All contents of such return shall be confidential and open only to the officials, employees, agents, or clerks of the city using such returns for the purpose of this occupation tax levy and the collection of the tax.

The city administrator shall have the right to inspect the books or records for the business of which the return was made in the city, and, upon demand of the city administrator, such books or records shall be submitted for inspection by a representative of the city within 30 days. Failure of submission of such books or records within 30 days shall be grounds for revocation of the tax registration currently existing to do business in the city. Adequate records shall be kept in the city for examination by the city administrator at that officer's discretion. If, after examination of the books or records, it is determined that a deficiency occurs as a result of underreporting, a penalty of ten percent of the deficiency and an additional one and one-half percent of the deficiency for each month or fraction thereof that the deficiency was due and unpaid shall be assessed.

                  Except for a person whose qualification to practice his profession is determined by the general laws of the state, upon the failure of any business to pay such occupation tax or any part thereof before it becomes delinquent, or upon the failure to make any of such returns within the time required herein, or upon failure to make a true return, or upon failure to amend a return to set forth the truth, or upon failure to permit inspection of its books as above provided, any business tax registration granted by the city under this article permitting the owner of the business to do business for the current year shall be, ipso facto, revoked. No new business tax registration shall be granted by the city for the operation of a business for which any part of the occupation tax herein provided for is at that time unpaid, or to an individual, firm, or corporation who has failed to submit adequate records as requested by the city administrator in accordance with provisions found in sections 22-47 and 22-48. In the case of those practitioners where the local government cannot suspend the right of the practitioner to conduct business, the imposition of civil penalties shall be permitted and pursued by the local government in the case of delinquent occupation tax.

                  In addition to the other remedies herein provided for the collection of the occupation tax herein levied, the city administrator, upon any tax or installment of such tax becoming delinquent and remaining unpaid, shall issue execution for the correct amount of such tax against the persons, partnership, or corporation liable for such tax, which execution shall bear interest at the rate authorized by O.C.G.A. § 48-2-40 or, if such statute should be repealed or ruled invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, 12 percent per annum from the date when such tax or installment becomes delinquent, and the lien shall cover the property in the city of the person, partnership, or corporation liable for such tax, all as provided by the ordinances and Charter of such city and the laws of the state. The lien of such occupation tax shall become fixed on the date from the time when such tax or any installment thereof becomes delinquent. The execution shall be levied by the marshal or other appropriate officer of such city upon the property of the defendant located in such jurisdiction, and sufficient property shall be advertised and sold to pay the amount of such execution, with interest and costs. All other proceedings in relation thereto shall be had as is provided by the ordinances and Charter of such city and the laws of the state, and the defendant in such execution shall have the rights of defense, by affidavit or illegality and otherwise, which are provided by the applicable laws in regard to tax executions. When a nulla bona entry has been entered by proper authority upon an execution issued by the city administrator against any person defaulting on the occupation tax, the person against whom the entry was made shall not be allowed or entitled to have or collect any fees or charges whatsoever for services rendered after the entry of the nulla bona. If, at any time after the entry of nulla bona has been made, the person against whom the execution issues pays the tax in full together with all interest and costs accrued on the tax, the person may collect any fees and charges due him or her as though he or she had never defaulted in the payment of the taxes.

Such amendment may increase or lower the amounts and tax rates of any occupation and may change the classification thereof. The payment of any occupation tax provided for shall not be construed as prohibiting the levy or collection by the jurisdiction of additional occupation taxes upon the same person, property, or business.

So much and such parts of ordinances heretofore and hereinafter passed that provided for the issuing and enforcing of executions for any tax or assessment required by such ordinances, or that imposed fines or penalties for the nonpayment of such tax, or for failure to pay regulatory fees provided for in such ordinance or ordinances, or failure to comply with any other provisions hereof, shall continue and remain in force until such tax, regulatory fee, or assessment shall be fully paid. 
                  (b)  It is hereby made the duty of the city administrator and code enforcement department to see that the provisions of this article relating to occupation taxes are observed; and to summon all violators of the same to appeal before the city's municipal court. It is hereby made the further duty of the city administrator and member of the code enforcement department to inspect all registrations issued by the city as often as in their judgment it may seem necessary to determine whether the registration held is the proper use for the business sought to be transacted thereunder. 
                  (c)  This article shall remain in full force and effect until changed by amendment adopted by the city council. All provisions hereto relating to any form of tax herein levied shall remain in full force and effect until such taxes have been paid in full. 
                  (d)  Where there is an apparent conflict in this article between specific and general provisions, it is the intention hereof that the specific provisions shall control.

                  Sec. 22-512. - License. 
                  (a)  Any person who owns or operates an internet café shall be required to obtain a license. No person shall be permitted to operate an internet café unless and until such a license is obtained. 
                  (b)  To obtain an internet café license, the applicant must: 
                  (1)  Complete an application provided by the city clerk which shall request information which includes the following: 
                  a.  Name of the owner, operator and address; 
                  b.  Number of computer units;

                  e.  Hours of the day during which the internet café is open to the public; and the number, names and addresses of the employees. 
                  Any untrue or misleading information contained in or material omission left out of an original or renewed application for a license under this article shall be cause for the denial thereof, and, if any license has been granted under these circumstances, same shall be cause for revocation. 
                  (2)  Provide documentation to prove that the applicant meets or exceeds the conditions of zoning pertaining to the property to be licensed; provide a site plan prepared and certified by a registered land surveyor or professional engineer depicting the location of the structure which will operate as the internet café; and pay the applicable license fee. Prior to the issuance of such license, the site plan shall be submitted to the director of the planning and economic development department for a determination as to whether the proposed site meets the standards set forth in the conditions of zoning and this article. 
                  (3)  Pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 35-3-35(a)(1.2), furnish a complete set of fingerprints for all owners of sole proprietorships, all officers and owners of 15 percent or more shares of any corporation, and all partners of partnerships in accordance with the following procedure: Two sets of fingerprints shall be taken by the Garden City Police Department and transmitted, together with the appropriate fees (unless a satisfactory billing arrangement has been entered into between the city and the State Identification Bureau) to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation will compare the subject's fingerprints against its criminal file and, if no disqualifying conduct is found therein, submit the fingerprints to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for comparison with nationwide records. The results of the Federal Bureau of Investigation check will be returned to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation which will disseminate the state and national results to the Garden City Police Department which shall forward the results to the city manager. In rendering a determination as to whether the applicant is fit to receive a license to operate an internet café within the city, the city manager will decide whether the applicant has been convicted of or is under pending indictment for: 
                  a.  A crime which bears upon disability or fitness to operate an internet café within the city; 
                  b.  Any felony or a misdemeanor which involves force or threat of force, controlled substance, or was a sex related offense; or 
                  c.  A criminal offense enumerated in subsection (c). The individual being fingerprinted may request and receive a copy of his/her criminal history record information from the city manager. Should the record subject seek to amend or correct his/her record, he/she must contact the Georgia Bureau of Investigation for a Georgia record or the Federal Bureau of Investigation for records from other jurisdictions maintained in its file. 
                  (c)  No person, partnership, business, firm, or corporation shall be granted a license if the person, partner, or officers, or the owners of 15 percent or more of the shares of or any interest in any such business, firm, partnership or corporation have been convicted of or have pleaded guilty or entered a plea of nolo contendere to any crime involving moral turpitude, lottery, gambling, illegal possession or sale of any narcotics, drugs or chemicals for which the sale thereof is controlled or prohibited by law, the control of the sale or distribution of alcoholic beverages, prostitution, solicitation or the possession or receiving of stolen property within a period of 15 years immediately prior to the filing of the application. Should any such person, partner, or officer or shareholder of a corporation, after a license has been granted, be convicted of or plead guilty or nolo contendere to any such crime, the license shall be subject to suspension or revocation. Withdrawal of an owner, officer, or partner or enumerated shareholder, after pleading guilty or nolo contendere to the above enumerated crimes, shall not necessarily mitigate against the penalty imposed in this section. 
                  (d)  Upon receipt of a license application submission, the city manager shall promptly examine the application for completeness; if a completed application has been submitted, together with a tender of the requisite fees, the city manager shall issue a provisional license, good for 45 days, under which the applicant may commence operation of the business; the city manager shall diligently investigate the applicant(s) and verify all required information, within the 45-day period; applicants may be required to appear, in person, before the city manager, for examination; on or before the 45th day, the city manager shall either (1) deny the license, stating in writing all objective grounds or lack of qualifications found, or (2) grant the license. Written notice of action shall be promptly issued to the applicant at the address shown in the application, by certified mail, return receipt requested. Whenever an application for a license is denied under this article, the aggrieved applicant shall have 30 days from the date of receipt of the written notice of denial to petition the Superior Court of Chatham County, Georgia, for a writ of certiorari; upon grant of the writ and motion by the petitioner for expedited hearing, the city attorney will consent to hear the matter as promptly as possible. 
                  (e)  Licenses issued under this article are not transferable. Any change in business ownership or location shall require submission of a new application based upon such change. 
                  (f)  The city shall issue no more than one license to an establishment meeting the definition of "internet café" in section 22-511 per each 2,000 persons, or fraction thereof, living in the city according to the most recent decennial census of the United States as published by the United States Bureau of the Census. 
                  (g)  The license shall be renewed each year. A change of ownership shall require a new license. 
                  (h)  Fees for the initial internet café license and renewal licenses shall be established by city council.

                  (Ord. No. 2011-16, § 2, 10-3-11; Ord. No. 2012-1, § 1, 3-19-12) 
                  Sec. 22-513. - Regulations. 
                  (a)  Any person or business licensed under this article shall comply with the following rules and regulations pertaining to the operation of internet cafes: 
                  (1)  No person shall carry on or assist in the carrying on any internet café business to which the public is invited, or in which the public may participate, between the hours of 2:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. A person six years and over and under the age of 18 years shall not be, remain in, or visit any internet café before the end of regular school hours as defined by the Chatham County Board of Education, or after 10:00 p.m. on school days and Sundays during school sessions, other than Fridays, and after 12:00 midnight on Fridays, Saturdays, and any other day including Sundays immediately preceding a day when school is not in session. 
                  (2)  The person in charge of such an internet café shall maintain at all times a sign posted on all doors providing entrance to the café in the form approved by the city stating "Persons under eighteen (18) years of age may not enter before the end of regular school hours on school days." 
                  (3)  The person in charge of such an internet café shall maintain at all times "no loitering" signs posted at the front and rear of the business. In addition, a waiting area with not less than eight seats shall be provided for customers waiting to use a computer. No outside waiting or seating area is permitted. 
                  (4)  No person shall continually indulge in boisterous conduct or continually use profanity or otherwise conduct oneself in a vulgar or indecent manner when such person is present in the café. 
                  (5)  No intoxicated person shall be permitted to remain in the café, nor shall there be consumption of alcohol on the premises. 
                  (6)  It shall be unlawful and a public nuisance for any person owning, managing or controlling an internet café to operate, maintain or carry on or assist in the operation or maintenance of an internet café in violation of any of the foregoing provisions. 
                  (7)  No person shall remain in an internet café or in the vicinity thereof in violation of any of the foregoing provisions or when requested to leave by the proprietor thereof or a law enforcement officer. 
                  (8)  The business shall be required through its owner, proprietor, lessee, and manager to maintain a centralized user's logbook which shall contain information provided by the user or customer of the internet café prior to the use of a computer including the name, age, address, school, and valid identification card or any legitimate proof of identification. 
                  (9)  This subsection (a) is inapplicable to any business that devotes ten percent or less of its gross floor area for the rental or charge for the use of computers having access to the internet system. 
                  (b)  Any game of chance which is offered on a computer and which provides for the distribution of prizes shall be a promotional giveaway or contest conforming with the qualifications of a lawful promotion under the safe-harbor exceptions of the O.C.G.A. §§ 16-12-20(4), 16-12-36(a), and 10-1-393(b)(16). 
                  (c)  No computer shall constitute a gambling device within the meaning of O.C.G.A. § 16-12-20(2). 
                  (Ord. No. 2011-16, § 2, 10-3-11) 
                  Sec. 22-514. - Minor access to internet café subject to parental control. 
                  (a)  It is hereby unlawful and a public nuisance for any proprietor, owner or operator of an internet café to provide access thereto by any person under the age of 18 years without the consent of said minor's parent or guardian. This protection is necessary to protect children from harmful material as hereinafter provided in this section. City council finds that exposure to such material is a matter of parental control or education through school or church or professional facilities designed to educate minors about sexual conduct. The display of the following explicit sexual activity, without parental control, in an unregulated setting is unlawful and a public nuisance. Such activity hereby prohibited in the presence of a minor is the following: 
                  (1)  Material depicting or simulating between actual persons or animals or simulated persons, sexual conduct as follows: 
                  a.  Sexual intercourse, including genital-genital, oral-genital, anal-genital, or oral-anal, whether between persons of the same or opposite sex or between humans and animals. 
                  b.  Penetration of the vagina or rectum by an object. 
                  c.  Masturbation for the purpose of sexual stimulation of the viewer. 
                  d.  Sadomasochistic abuse for the purpose of sexual stimulation of the viewer. 
                  e.  Exhibition of the genitals or the pubic or rectal area of any person for the purpose of sexual stimulation of the viewer. 
                  f.  Defecation or urination for the purpose of sexual stimulation of the viewer. 
                  (2)  Exhibition of the naked human body exposing female breasts, or male or female genitals, or the pubic or rectal area, or any part thereof. 
                  (3)  The explicit exposure of any of the foregoing in any kind of sexual activity. 
                  (4)  The explicit exposure of the above in explicit sexual activity in any kind of narrative, movie, act, play or story. 
                  (5)  The foregoing applies whether the presentation is made by actual human beings or animals or simulated images thereof. 
                  (b)  Nothing contained in the aforementioned paragraph (a) shall be deemed to prohibit the display of indecent, or harmful, or obscene material, except as otherwise prohibited by law, to persons over 18 attending an internet café. City council finds that there is no intent in enacting this section to censor, prohibit or oversee material legally accessible to adults through the internet. 
                  (c)  A proprietor of an internet café, or employee or agent thereof, shall only allow a minor to attend said internet café where the minor produces a parental consent or control card in the form approved by the city unless said minor is accompanied by a parent or guardian. Failure of any internet café proprietor or manager or employee to require such a card from a minor unless accompanied by a parent or guardian is unlawful. Any minor found on the premises without such a parental access card unless accompanied by a parent or guardian shall be immediately ordered to leave the premises, and failure to do so by any adult employee of the internet café is unlawful. It is unlawful for any person to remain in or in the vicinity of an internet café when ordered to leave the same by a person in charge or a law enforcement officer. A proprietor of an internet café shall maintain at all times a sign in the form approved by the city on all doors providing access thereto that minors are not allowed unless accompanied by a parent or guardian or they have a parental access card. 
                  (d)  The provisions of paragraph (c) are inapplicable to any owner or operator of an internet café who, as a condition to the granting of a license, agrees to the following additional conditions: 
                  (1)  A sign shall be posted and maintained at all times on all doors giving access to the internet café stating in effect that "no adult materials are allowed to be accessed on the premises." 
                  (2)  The proprietor agrees to install and maintain at all times in each computer to which anyone has access software or other device that will filter or block out adult materials as defined in paragraph (a). The type of filter or software adopted shall be in the discretion of the proprietor of the premises subject only to the city's inspection to determine whether applying the most recent state of the art that said filter or device reasonably blocks out the obnoxious material defined in paragraph (a). City council finds, determines, and orders that any city officer or employee in reviewing the software or device used to block out the undesirable materials shall be without discretion to determine what is obnoxious or obscene, and the sole function of the city officer or employee shall be to determine whether or not the software or device reasonably blocks out the activity described in paragraph (a). City council is aware that this is a growing state of the art and the device may not be effective in all cases, but city officers and employees shall require the proprietor to obtain the most reasonable and effective devices available at a reasonable charge. 
                  (Ord. No. 2011-16, § 2, 10-3-11) 
                  Sec. 22-515. - License revocation or suspension; hearing procedures. 
                  (a)  No license which has been issued pursuant to this article shall be suspended or revoked except for due cause and after hearing and upon prior three-day written notice to the holder(s) of the license of the same, place and purpose of the hearing and a statement of the charges upon which the hearing shall be held. 
                  (b)  The term "due cause" for the purposes of this section shall include, but not be limited to: 
                  (1)  Conviction of, or the entering of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere by the licensee or any person holding an interest in the license for any felony, a crime involving moral turpitude, any law, administrative regulation or ordinance involving alcoholic beverages, sexual offenses, gambling, drug offenses, or tax laws. 
                  (2)  Conviction of, or the entering of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere by any of the licensee's employees or any person rendering services to the licensee as an independent contractor of the business for any law, administrative regulation or ordinance involving alcoholic beverages, sexual offenses, gambling, drug offenses, or tax laws. 
                  (3)  Suspension or revocation of any state license required as a condition for the operation of the adult business. 
                  (4)  Material falsification of any fact given in an application for a license issued under this article or bearing upon the licensee's qualification therefor, including any renewal thereof. Any act which may be construed as a subterfuge in an effort to circumvent any of the qualifications for a license under this article shall be deemed a violation of the requirement attempted to be circumvented. 
                  (5)  Failure to meet or maintain any standard prescribed by this article as a condition or qualification for holding a license, including payment of license fees and taxes when due. 
                  (6)  Any other factor known to or discovered by the city manager whereby it is objectively shown the licensee, any person holding an interest in a license, or any of the licensee's employees has engaged in conduct at or involving the licensed business or has permitted conduct on the licensed premises that constitutes a violation of federal or state law, administrative regulations, or ordinance involving alcoholic beverages, sexual offenses, gambling or narcotics. With respect to this section, it shall be reputably presumed that the violative act was done with the knowledge or consent of the licensee; provided, however, that such presumption may be rebutted only by evidence which precludes every other reasonable hypothesis save that such licensee did not know, assist or aid in such occurrence, or in the exercise of full diligence that such licensee could not have discovered or prevented such activity. 
                  (c)  Notice of suspension or revocation proceedings shall be served on the person named as licensee in the application. Notice shall be in writing. The notice may be served personally or by first class mail. If by mail, the notice shall be addressed to the licensee at its address as it appears in the records of the city. The burden shall be on the licensee to provide notice, in writing, of any change of address for service of notices and process. In the case of service by mail of any notice required by this article, the service is complete at the time of deposit in the United States Postal Service. 
                  (d)  The hearing shall be conducted by a hearing officer appointed by the mayor. The hearing officer shall be an attorney licensed to practice in the state who is disinterested in the outcome of the proceeding. 
                  (e)  Hearings shall be only as formal as necessary to preserve order and shall be compatible with the principles of justice. The city attorney shall present the city's case and bear the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that due cause exists to suspend or revoke the license. At the hearing, the licensee shall have the right to represent itself or be represented by counsel, may cross examine all witnesses offered by the city, and may call witnesses and present evidence in its own behalf. Formal rules of evidence shall not apply to hearings under this section, although the hearing officer shall have the right to exclude evidence which carries no indicia of reliability. All testimony shall be offered under oath or affirmation. 
                  (f)  The hearing officer shall make his final determination within ten business days of the completion of the hearing. The decision shall be placed in writing and contain the hearing officer's findings of fact, conclusions of law, and decision as to sanctions, if any. Such sanctions may include one or more of the following: immediate revocation of the license, suspension of the license for a time certain (which cannot exceed the time remaining on the license for the current calendar year), imposition of a civil monetary penalty not to exceed $1,000.00, and/or conditioning renewal of future licenses to a probationary period not to exceed two years. Progressive sanctions, depending on the severity of the violation, are encouraged but not required. Where the remaining term of the license is less than 12 months, imposition of suspension or probation for a period in excess of the term of the existing license shall be applied to any renewal license. A subsequent violation within a probationary period shall be cause for revocation and/or denial of license renewal. A total of three separate and unrelated violations within 24 months, whether or not within a probationary period, shall be grounds for permanent revocation. 
                  (g)  The hearing officer's decision shall be personally served or mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the licensee and his attorney, with a copy to the city attorney, within ten business days of the close of the hearing. The decision of the hearing officer shall constitute final action by the city, subject to review upon petition for certiorari to the superior court, upon application filed within 30 days of notice of the decision. 
                  (h)  Upon receipt of notice of adverse action against the licensee under this section, the licensee may waive its right to a hearing and stipulate to a sanction, as recommended by the city manager, in consultation with the chief of police and city attorney. Any stipulation entered under this subsection shall be in writing, signed by the licensee, and nonappealable. 
                  (Ord. No. 2011-16, § 2, 10-3-11) 
                  Sec. 22-516. - Violation of article; sanctions. 
                  (a)  Any person violating the provisions of this article shall be guilty of an offense against the city, punishable upon conviction by the municipal court, as set forth in section 1-13 of this Code. In addition to such fine or imprisonment, violation of this article shall be grounds for revocation or suspension of any license issued under this article. Each day a violation continues shall be deemed a separate offense. 
                  (b)  Any internet café business operated, conducted, or maintained contrary to the provisions of this article is hereby declared to be unlawful and a public nuisance. In addition to or in lieu of prosecuting a violation under subsection (a) above, the city may seek an injunction against the continued operation and maintenance of the business in the superior court. In addition, violation of the provisions of this article shall be grounds for revocation or suspension of any license issued under this article.

                  (Ord. No. 2010-9, § 1, 6-21-10; Ord. No. 2016-11, § 1, 11-7-16) 
                  Sec. 30-54. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices. 
                  (a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the ordinance and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections 30-54(b) and (c) of this article. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit. 
                  (b)  Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
                  (1)  Best management practices as set forth in Garden City Code subsections 30-54(b) and (c) of this ordinance shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of storm water issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
                  (2)  A discharge of storm water runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land-disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land-disturbing activities occur. 
                  (5)  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in Garden City Code subsections 30-54(c)(15) and (c)(16) and (c)(17), in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
                  (c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regarding and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practical erosion potential; 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  (7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in Garden City Code subsection 30-54(b)(2); 
                  (15)  Except as provided in paragraph (16) and (17) of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term 'ephemeral stream' means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow, unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines. 
                  (17)  There is established a 25-foot buffer along coastal marshlands, as measured horizontally from the coastal marshland-upland interface, as determined in accordance with Chapter 5 of Title 12 of this title, the "Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1970." And the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to Code section 12-2-8, where an alteration within the buffer area has been authorized pursuant to Code section 12-5-286, for maintenance of any currently serviceable structure, landscaping, or hardscaping, including bridges, roads, parking lots, golf courses, golf cart paths, retaining walls, bulkheads, and patios; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, where a drainage structure or roadway drainage structure is constructed or maintained; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, on the landward side of any currently serviceable shoreline stabilization structure, or for the maintenance of any manmade storm-water detention basin, golf course pond, or impoundment that is located entirely within the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. For the purposes of this paragraph maintenance shall be defined as actions necessary or appropriate for retaining or restoring a currently serviceable improvement to the specified operable condition to achieve its maximum useful life. Maintenance includes emergency reconstruction of recently damaged parts of a currently serviceable structure so long as it occurs within a reasonable period of time after damage occurs. Maintenance does not include any modification that changes the character, scope or size of the original design and serviceable shall be defined as usable in its current state or with minor maintenance but not so degraded as to essentially require reconstruction. 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to crossings for utility lines that cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer, provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
                  c.  The buffer shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity conducted pursuant to and in compliance with a valid and effective land-disturbing permit issued subsequent to April 22, 2014, and prior to December 31, 2015; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented or any lot for which the preliminary plat has been approved prior to December 31, 2015 if roadways, bridges, or water and sewer lines have been extended to such lot prior to the effective date of this Act and if the requirement to maintain a 25 foot buffer would consume at least 18 percent of the high ground of the platted lot otherwise available for development; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
                  d.  Activities where the area within the buffer is not more than 500 square feet or that have a "Minor Buffer Impact" as defined in 391-3-7-.01(r), provided that the total area of buffer impacts is less than 5,000 square feet are deemed to have an approved buffer variance by rule. Bank stabilization structures are not eligible for coverage under the variance by rule and notification shall be made to the division at least 14 days prior to the commencement of land disturbing. 
                  e.  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in Garden City Code subsections 30-54(b) and (c). 
                  f.  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit.

                  Sec. 30-66. - Application/permit process. 
                  (a)  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, storm water management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
                  (b)  Application requirements. 
                  (1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the city without first obtaining a permit from the issuing authority of the city to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
                  (2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the issuing authority and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in paragraph (c) of this section. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land-disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of Garden City Code subsections 30-54(b) and (c) of this section will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by six copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
                  (3)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(5)(a), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land-disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  (4)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the District for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the District, and any variances required by Garden City Code subsections 30-54 (c)(15), (16) and (17) has been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per subsection (b)(6) of this section, have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
                  (5)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this article section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
                  (6)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  (c)  Plan requirements . 
                  (1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in Garden City Code subsections 30-54(b) and (c), or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this ordinance. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and stormwater management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land-disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
                  (2)  Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate Erosion, Sedimentation and Pollution Control Plan Review Checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
                  (d)  Permits. 
                  (1)  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
                  (2)  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this article, any variances required by Garden City Code subsections 30-54(c)(15), (16) and (17) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per Garden City Code subsection 30-66(b)(6) are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
                  (3)  Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this article, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
                  (4)  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
                  (5)  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the Local Issuing Authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this article. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
                  (6)  The LIA may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(f)(1). 
                  (Ord. No. 2010-9, § 1, 6-21-10; Ord. No. 2016-11, § 1, 11-7-16) 
                  Sec. 30-67. - Inspection and enforcement. 
                  (a)  The building official will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article.

                  (b)  Stop-work orders. 
                  (1)  For the first and second violations of the provisions of this article, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have five days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within five days, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a stop-work order requiring that land-disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided, however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land-disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order in lieu of a warning; 
                  (2)  For a third and each subsequent violation, the Director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order; 
                  (3)  All stop-work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; and

All such stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop work orders shall apply to all land-disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls. 
                  (c)  Bond forfeiture. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities has failed to comply with the approved plan, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this ordinance and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to have forfeited his performance bond, if required to post one under the provisions of Garden City Code subsection 30-66(b)(6). The local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. 
                  (d)  Monetary penalties. 
                  (1)  Any person who violates any provisions of this article, or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant to this article, or who negligently or intentionally fails or refuses to comply with any final or emergency order of the director issued as provided in this article shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 per day. For the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this article, notwithstanding any provisions in any City Charter to the contrary, municipal courts shall be authorized to impose penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Notwithstanding any limitation of law as to penalties which can be assessed for violations of county ordinances, any magistrate court or any other court of competent jurisdiction trying cases brought as violations of this article under county ordinances approved under this ordinance shall be authorized to impose penalties for such violations not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Each day during which violation or failure or refusal to comply continues shall be a separate violation.

A project site shall herein be defined as any land-disturbance site or multiple sites within a larger common plan of development or sale permitted by an owner or operator for compliance with the state general permit. 
                  (c)  Persons or entities involved in projects not requiring a state general permit but otherwise requiring certified personnel on site may contract with certified persons to meet the requirements of this article. 
                  (d)  If a state general permittee who has operational control of land-disturbing activities for a site has met the certification requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-19(b)(1), then any person or entity involved in land-disturbing activity at that site and operating in a subcontractor capacity for such permittee shall meet those educational requirements specified in O.C.G.A § 12-7-19(b)(4) and shall not be required to meet any educational requirements that exceed those specified in said paragraph.

                  (a)  Administrative remedies. The suspension, revocation, modification or grant with condition of a permit by the local issuing authority upon finding that the holder is not in compliance with the approved erosion, sediment and pollution control plan; or that the holder is in violation of permit conditions; or that the holder is in violation of any ordinance; shall entitle the person submitting the plan or holding the permit to a hearing before the mayor within 15 days after receipt by the local issuing authority of written notice of appeal. 
                  (b)  Judicial review. Any person, aggrieved by a decision or order of the local issuing authority, after exhausting his administrative remedies, shall have the right to appeal denovo to the Superior Court of Chatham County, Georgia.

                  (c)  Liability. 
                  (1)  Neither the approval of a plan under the provisions of this article, nor the compliance with provisions of this article shall relieve any person from the responsibility for damage to any person or property otherwise imposed by law nor impose any liability upon the local issuing authority or district for damage to any person or property. 
                  (2)  The fact that a land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
                  (3)  No provision of this article shall permit any persons to violate the Georgia Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act or the rules and regulations promulgated and approved thereunder or pollute any waters of the state as defined thereby.

The tax commissioner shall remit the amount collected to the governing authority of the city. Thirty days after imposition of the lien, the unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes. 
                  (2)  The tax commissioner shall collect and retain an amount equal to the cost of administering a lien authorized by O.C.G.A. § 41-2-7 et seq. unless such costs are waived by resolution of Chatham County.

                  (5)  The public officers designated herein may issue citations for violations of state minimum standard codes, optional building, fire, life safety, and other codes adopted by ordinance, and conditions creating a public health hazard or general nuisance, and may seek to enforce such citation in courts of competent jurisdiction prior to issuing a complaint in rem as provided in this division. 
                  (6)  Nothing in this division shall be construed to impair or limit in any way the power of the city to define and declare nuisances and to cause their removal or abatement by summary proceedings or otherwise.

                  DIVISION 6. - GRAFFITI 

                  Sec. 30-180. - Purpose and intent. 
                  (a)  The mayor and council of the city are enacting this division to help prevent the spread of graffiti vandalism and to establish a program for the removal of graffiti from public and private property. The council is authorized to enact this division pursuant to its police powers, as specified in Section 1.12(29) of the City Charter which authorizes the city, under certain circumstances, to provide for the removal of graffiti from private and public property. 
                  (b)  The council finds that graffiti is a public nuisance and destructive of the rights and values of property owners as well as the entire community. Unless the city acts to remove graffiti from public and private property, the graffiti tends to remain. Other properties then become the target of graffiti, and entire neighborhoods are affected and become less desirable places in which to be, all to the detriment of the city. 
                  (c)  The mayor and council intend, through the adoption of this division, to provide additional enforcement tools to protect public and private property from acts of graffiti vandalism and defacement. The mayor and council do not intend for this division to conflict with any existing anti-graffiti state laws.

                  This division is adopted to address the interest of public safety. 
                  (1)  The governing authority finds that there is a need to establish a foreclosure and vacant real property registry as a mechanism to protect property values in neighborhoods for all property owners. 
                  (2)  Due to the lack of adequate maintenance and security of properties that are foreclosed or where ownership has been transferred after foreclosure, the property values and quality of life of neighboring properties are negatively impacted. 
                  (3)  Improperly maintained and secured foreclosed properties can become a hazard to the health and safety of persons who may come on or near the property and can adversely affect the aesthetic and economic attributes of communities. Difficulties also often arise in locating the person responsible for the condition of foreclosed real property. The governing authority finds that there is a substantial need directly related to the public health, safety and welfare to comprehensively address these concerns through the adoption of the provisions in this division. 
                  (4)  A foreclosure and vacant real property registry will require owners and agents to provide the city with official information for contacting a party responsible for bringing foreclosed and vacant real property into compliance with applicable provisions of the City Code.

                  (b)  Foreclosed real property means improved or unimproved real property for which a land disturbance permit has been issued by a county or municipal corporation and is held pursuant to a judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure of a mortgage, deed of trust, security deed, or other security instrument securing a debt or obligation owed to a creditor or a deed in lieu of foreclosure in full or partial satisfaction of a debt or obligation owed to a creditor or shall have the same meaning as set forth in the O.C.G.A. § 44-14-14, should that definition differ.

                  Editor's note— Ord. No. 2011-15, § 1, adopted Aug. 15, 2011, repealed former Art. V, Div. 1, § 30-230—30-243, and enacted a new Art. Div. 1 as set out herein. Former Art. X, Div. 1 pertained to the same subject matter and derived from Ord. of 3-16-98, § 1. 

                  DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

                  Sec. 30-230. - Findings of fact. 
                  It is hereby determined that: 
                  (1)  The land development process significantly alters the hydrologic response of development sites, increasing stormwater runoff rates, volumes and pollutant loads, which could increase incidents of flooding thereby endangering infrastructure, public and private property and human life; 
                  (2)  The land development process significantly alters the hydrologic response of development sites, increasing stormwater runoff rates, volumes and pollutant loads, and alters water levels and fluctuations and increases pollutant transport and deposition in wetlands, rivers and streams; 
                  (3)  The land development process significantly alters the hydrologic response of development sites, increasing stormwater runoff rates, volumes and pollutant loads, and alters salinity concentrations and fluctuations and increases primary productivity and pollutant transport and deposition in estuaries; 
                  (4)  The land development process significantly alters the hydrologic response of development sites, increasing stormwater runoff rates, volumes and pollutant loads, and increases bacteria transport and deposition in near coastal waters, which leads to beach contamination and poses a serious threat to human health; 
                  (5)  The land development process significantly alters the hydrologic response of development sites, increasing stormwater runoff rates and volumes, and decreases the amount of rainfall that is available to recharge shallow groundwater aquifers; 
                  (6)  The negative impacts of the land development process on local aquatic resources can adversely affect the health, safety and general welfare of the general public as well as the quality of life of its citizens; 
                  (7)  Every residential and nonresidential parcel of real property, both public and private, benefits from the implementation of stormwater management regulations as well as proper maintenance and operation of the municipal storm sewer system (MS4); 
                  (8)  The negative impacts of the land development process can be controlled and minimized through the management of stormwater runoff rates, volumes and pollutant loads; 
                  (9)  Communities located within Georgia's Coastal Nonpoint Source Management Area and area of special interest are required to comply with a number of state and federal regulations that require the adverse impacts of the land development process to be controlled and minimized; 
                  (10)  Therefore, the City of Garden City has determined that it is in the public interest to control and minimize the adverse impacts of the land development process and has established this set of local stormwater management regulations to control post-construction stormwater runoff rates, volumes and pollutant loads on development and redevelopment sites. 
                  (Ord. No. 2011-15, § 1, 8-15-11) 
                  Sec. 30-231. - Purpose and intent. 
                  The purpose of this article is to protect and maintain the integrity of local aquatic resources and, consequently, the health, safety and welfare of the general public, by establishing localstormwater management regulations that control and minimize the adverse impacts of the land development process. The ordinance seeks to achieve these goals by enacting provisions that: 
                  (1)  Protect, maintain, and enhance the short-term and long-term public health, safety, and general welfare. This objective will be achieved by providing for regulation and management of a municipal storm sewer system, including public and private facilities in the city's service area. 
                  (2)  Comply with the Georgia Department of Natural Resources (DNR) and federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) stormwater regulations developed pursuant to the Clean Water Act. These requirements include: 
                  a.  Control the discharge of stormwater and contribution of pollutants to the municipal storm sewer system (MS4) by stormwater discharges associated with impervious area and the quality of stormwater discharged from sites with impervious area; 
                  b.  Prohibit illicit connections and/or discharges to the MS4; 
                  c.  Control discharge to municipal storm sewers of spills, dumping or disposal of materials other than stormwater; and 
                  d.  Control, through intergovernmental agreements, contribution of pollutants from one municipal/county system to another. 
                  (3)  Establish minimum requirements and procedures to regulate the adverse effects of increased stormwater runoff and development in flood hazard areas. 
                  (4)  Establishing decision-making processes that can be applied during the site planning and design process to help protect the integrity of local aquatic resources; 
                  (5)  Establishing post-construction stormwater management and site planning and design criteria to help protect natural resources from the direct impacts of the land development process and preserve existing hydrologic conditions on development sites; 
                  (6)  Establishing post-construction stormwater management and site planning and design criteria to help reduce flooding, channel erosion and pollutant transport and deposition in local aquatic resources; 
                  (7)  Establishing design guidelines for green infrastructure and stormwater management practices that can be used to meet the post-construction stormwater management and site planning and design criteria; 
                  (8)  Encouraging that green infrastructure practices, which include better site planning techniques, better site design techniques and low impact development practices, be used to the maximum extent practical on development sites; 
                  (9)  Establishing provisions for the long-term inspection and maintenance of green infrastructure and stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed and pose no threat to public safety; and 
                  (10)  Establishing administrative procedures for the submittal, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans and for the inspection of approved development projects.

                  Sec. 30-232. - Applicability and exemptions. 
                  (a)  This article shall be applied to all land disturbing activities, unless exempt pursuant to subsection (b) of this section. The stormwater management regulations presented within shall be applied to any new development or redevelopment activity that meets one or more of the following criteria: 
                  (1)  New development that involves the creation of 5,000 square feet or more of impervious cover or that involves other land disturbing activities of one acre or more; 
                  (2)  Redevelopment that involves the creation, addition or replacement of 5,000 square feet or more of impervious cover or that involves other land disturbing activities of one acre or more. 
                  (3)  New development or redevelopment, regardless of size, that is part of a larger common plan of development, even though multiple, separate and distinct land disturbing activities may take place at different times and on different schedules. 
                  (4)  New development or redevelopment, regardless of size, that involves the creation or modification of a stormwater hotspot, as defined herein as well as in the City's Code of Ordinances, Stormwater Utility Credit Manual, the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual (GSMM) and other related guidance. 
                  (b)  The following activities are exempt from this article: 
                  (1)  New development or redevelopment that involves the creation, addition or replacement of less than 5,000 square feet of impervious cover and that involves less than one acre of other land disturbing activities. 
                  (2)  New development or redevelopment activities on individual residential lots that are not part of a larger common plan of development and do not meet any of the applicability criteria listed above. 
                  (3)  Additions or modifications to existing single-family homes and duplex residential units that do not meet any of the applicability criteria listed above. 
                  (4)  Development projects that are undertaken exclusively for agricultural or silvicultural purposes within areas zoned for agricultural or silvicultural land use. 
                  (5)  Maintenance and repairs of any green infrastructure or stormwater management practices deemed necessary by the city manager (or his designee). 
                  (6)  Any part of a land development project that was approved by the Garden City Mayor and City Council prior to the adoption of this ordinance provided that it meets the stipulations outlined in subsection (c) of this section. 
                  (7)  Redevelopment activities that involve the replacement of impervious cover when the original impervious cover was wholly or partially lost due to natural disaster or other acts of God. 
                  (c)  Phased developments with existing stormwater master plans. For phased development projects, a stormwater master plan shall be prepared to conceptually indicate how the minimum requirements of the city's previous stormwater management ordinance were to have been met. The stormwater master plan shall consolidate detention facilities to the maximum extent practical. The existence of a stormwater master plan does not necessarily preclude compliance with the requirements of this article for each subsequent phase as it is being developed. However, the city manager or his designee will favorably consider the existence of a site-specific stormwater master plan that is substantially compliant with subsection 30-239(b) of this article when evaluating the applicability of this ordinance to subsequent phases of development. The city manager or his designee may require that additional requirements be incorporated into the subsequent phases of development to protect the health, safety and welfare of the general public as well as to ensure compliance with applicable federal, state and local regulations.

                  Sec. 30-261. - Purpose. 
                  This division establishes the Garden City Stormwater Utility and sets up the Stormwater Enterprise Fund. 
                  (Ord. No. 2008-28, § 1, 11-17-08) 
                  Sec. 30-262. - Findings of fact. 
                  The Garden City Mayor and City Council make the following findings of fact: 
                  (1)  The City of Garden City is authorized by the Georgia Constitution of 1983, including, without limitation, Article IX, Section II, Paragraphs I and III thereof and O.C.G.A. § 36-82-62 to provide stormwater management services, systems and facilities throughout the corporate boundaries of the City of Garden City (hereinafter "the city" or "Garden City"). 
                  (2)  In promulgating the regulations contained in this section, Garden City is acting pursuant to authority granted by the Constitution and laws of the State of Georgia and its City Charter to provide for stormwater collection and disposal. A system for the collection, conveyance, storage, treatment and disposal of stormwater provides benefits to all properties within the city and surrounding areas. 
                  (3)  Failure to effectively manage stormwater runoff: 
                  a.  May cause erosion of lands, threaten businesses and residences, and other facilities with water damage and may environmentally impair the rivers, streams and other bodies of water within, and downstream of, the city. 
                  b.  Can adversely affect the operations of the sanitary sewer system operated by the city thereby increasing the likelihood of infiltration and inflow into the sanitary sewer system; and, 
                  c.  Contributes to the potential degradation of the quality of both surface water and groundwater resources. 
                  (4)  The city presently owns and operates stormwater management systems and facilities, which have been developed over many years. The future usefulness and operational function of the existing stormwater management systems and facilities owned and operated by the city, and the additions and improvements thereto, rests on the ability of the city to effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use, and enhance stormwater systems and facilities within the city in concert with the management of other water resources within the city. In order to do so, the city must have both a comprehensive stormwater management program as well as an adequate and stable funding source for its comprehensive program operation and drainage-related capital improvement needs. 
                  (5)  The city is required under federal and state regulations (i.e., the Federal Clean Water Act, the city's national pollutant discharge elimination system (hereinafter "NPDES") phase I stormwater permit) to provide enhanced management of stormwater runoff quality to mitigate the impacts of pollutants which may be discharged from the public municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) and stormwater conveyance system into State of Georgia or United States' waters. 
                  (6)  Compliance with the regulatory obligations of the city's NPDES phase I stormwater permit, NPDES wastewater discharge permit, the coastal comprehensive plan and the city's watershed protection plan will affect the cost of providing stormwater management services, systems and facilities above what is currently being spent for stormwater quality management, drainage system maintenance, floodplain management, capital drainage projects and other program activities. 
                  (7)  The cost of operating and maintaining the city's stormwater management system and the funding of necessary repairs, replacements, improvements and extensions thereof should, to the extent practicable, be allocated in relationship to the services received from the city's stormwater management program. 
                  (8)  The professional engineering and financing analysis and related documents prepared by the city's consulting stormwater engineer properly assesses and defines the city's stormwater management program problems, needs, goals, priorities as well as the stormwater management program funding strategy. 
                  (9)  Given the stormwater management program problems, needs, goals, priorities and funding strategy identified in the aforementioned professional engineering and financing analysis, it is appropriate to authorize the formation of an organizational and accounting entity dedicated specifically to the management, maintenance, protection, control, regulation, use, and enhancement of stormwater management services, systems and facilities within the city in concert with other water resource management programs. 
                  (10)  Stormwater management is applicable and needed throughout the incorporated areas of the city. While specific service and facility demands may differ from area to area at any given point in time, a stormwater management system and service area encompassing all lands and water bodies within the incorporated areas of the city is consistent with the present and future needs of the community. 
                  (11)  The stormwater management services rendered may differ depending on many factors and considerations, including but not limited to location, demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater management systems and programs, and risk exposure. It is practical and equitable to allocate the cost of stormwater management among the owners of improved properties in proportion to the demands the properties impose on the city's stormwater management services which result in services to such properties and the owners thereof. The fair and equitable apportionment of costs via the user fee charge should correlate to the stormwater management services provided to that property and the runoff demand that the property imposes on the public drainage system and the city stormwater management program. 
                  (12)  The stormwater management needs in the city include, but are not limited to, protection of the public health, safety, and welfare of the community. Provision of stormwater management services renders and/or results in both a service and a benefit to all properties, property owners, citizens, and residents of the city in a variety of ways. 
                  (13)  A stormwater management program provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering stormwater management services throughout the city, and the most equitable means to implement an enhanced level of service for stormwater management within the city through stormwater user fee charges, user fees and other mechanisms. 
                  (14)  The presence and amount of impervious surfaces on each improved property is the most important factor influencing the cost of the stormwater management services provided by the city, or to be provided by the city in the future, to that property such that the amount of impervious surfaces on each property is the most appropriate parameter for calculating a periodic stormwater user fee charge. Therefore, the city deems it appropriate to impose a stormwater user fee charge upon all improved properties that may discharge, directly or indirectly, into the public drainage system, whether the property is private or public in nature. 
                  (15)  A schedule of stormwater utility user fee charges based in part on the area of impervious surface located on each improved property is the most appropriate and equitable means of allocating the cost of stormwater management services throughout the city. Stormwater utility user fee charges may be designed with specific modifiers to further enhance customer equity, as well as customer understanding of the user fee charge rate structure, while at the same time minimizing the city's customer account management and maintenance efforts. 
                  (16)  Stormwater utility user fee charges may be supplemented by other types of fees and charges which address specific needs, including, but not limited to, special service fees, special assessments, revenue bonds, use of proceeds from special purpose local option sales taxes (SPLOST) and other forms of revenue, as deemed appropriate by the mayor and city council. 
                  (17)  The existence of privately owned and maintained on-site stormwater control facilities, activities or assets which reduce, or otherwise mitigate, the impact of a particular property on the city's storm water management program, and the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and/or stormwater management systems and facilities, should be taken into account to reduce the user fee charge on that property either in the form of a direct reduction or a credit, and such reduction or credit should be conditioned upon continuing provision of such services, systems, facilities, activities or assets in a manner complying with the standards and codes as determined by the stormwater utility. Credits for privately owned and maintained stormwater management systems, facilities, activities or assets shall be generally proportional to the affect that such systems have on the reduction and mitigation of the stormwater runoff impacts from the property. 
                  (18)  It is imperative that the proceeds from all user fee charges for stormwater management services, systems or facilities, together with any other supplemental revenues raised or otherwise allocated specifically to stormwater management services, systems or facilities, be dedicated solely to those purposes, and such proceeds of user fee charges and supplemental revenues shall therefore be deposited into the city stormwater utility enterprise fund and shall remain in that fund and be dispersed only for stormwater management capital, operating and nonoperating costs, lease payments and debt service of bonds or other indebtedness for stormwater management purposes. 
                  (19)  In order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public, the governing authority of Garden City hereby concludes a stormwater utility, funded by a dedicated stormwater utility enterprise fund, is warranted as the best available means of addressing the foregoing needs and legal requirements. By separate ordinance, the city will enact a user fee rate structure to establish user fees for the provision of stormwater management services.

                  Sec. 30-263. - Definitions. 
                  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Act means and refers to the Clean Water Act as amended by the Water Quality Act of 1987 (33 U.S.C. § 1251 et seq.), as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency pursuant thereto. 
                  Customers of the stormwater utility shall include all persons, properties, and entities serviced by and/or benefiting from the services provided by the city's stormwater management program and the stormwater utility. These services include, but are not necessarily limited to, the stormwater utility's administration, management, maintenance, expansion, and improvement of the public stormwater management systems for the handling of stormwater runoff of private and public properties, and the regulation of the public and private stormwater management systems, controls, facilities, and activities. 
                  Hydrologic response defines the manner and means whereby stormwater collects, remains, infiltrates, and is conveyed from a property. Hydrologic response is dependent on several factors including, but not limited to, the presence of impervious surface, the parcel's size, the parcel's shape, the parcel's topography, the parcel's vegetative canopy, the parcel's groundwater characteristics, the parcel's on-site operations, the parcel's stormwater controls, the parcel's antecedent moisture as well as the parcel's geologic and hydro-geologic characteristics. 
                  Impervious area shall mean and have the same definition as impervious surface. 
                  Impervious surface means those areas which prevent or impede the infiltration of stormwater into the soil in the manner in which it entered the soil, in natural conditions, prior to development and causes stormwater runoff to collect, concentrate or flow in a manner materially different from what would occur if the land were in an unaltered natural condition. Common impervious surfaces include, but are not limited to, rooftops, buildings or structures, sidewalks, walkways, patio areas, driveways, parking lots, storage areas, awnings and other fabric or plastic coverings, and other surfaces such as compacted soil and gravel, which prevent or impede the natural infiltration of rainfall and stormwater runoff which existed prior to development. 
                  Improved property (or developed property) means property altered from its natural state by construction or installation of more than 500 square feet of impervious surfaces. 
                  Service area means the entire land area within the corporate limits of the city. 
                  Stormwater management services mean all services provided by the city which relate to the: 
                  (1)  Transfer, control, conveyance or movement of stormwater runoff through the incorporated portions of the city; 
                  (2)  Maintenance, repair and replacement of existing stormwater management systems and facilities; 
                  (3)  Planning, development, design and construction of additional stormwater management systems and facilities to meet current and anticipated needs; 
                  (4)  Regulation of the use of stormwater management services, systems and facilities; and 
                  (5)  Compliance with applicable state and federal stormwater management regulations and permit requirements. 
                  Stormwater management services may address the quality of stormwater runoff as well as the quantity thereof. 
                  Stormwater management systems and facilities mean those natural and manmade channels, swales, ditches, rivers, streams, creeks, branches, reservoirs, ponds, drainage ways, inlets, catch basins, pipes, headwalls, storm sewers, lakes and other physical works, properties and improvements which transfer, control, convey, detain, retain, treat or otherwise influence the movement of stormwater runoff. 
                  Stormwater utility manager means the person appointed by the mayor and city council to administer the provisions of this article. 
                  Stormwater user fee charge means the periodic user fee charge imposed pursuant to this article by the Garden City Stormwater Utility for providing stormwater management services. This term shall exclude special charges to the owners of particular properties for services, systems or facilities related to stormwater management, including, but not limited to, charges for development plan review, inspection of development projects, on-site stormwater control systems and other stormwater management related services provided by Garden City for which a corresponding fee is collected for the service rendered. 
                  Undeveloped land means land in its unaltered natural condition or which is modified to such a minimal degree as to have a hydrologic response comparable to land in an unaltered natural condition shall be deemed undeveloped. For purposes of this article, undeveloped land includes property altered from its natural condition by the creation or installation of 500 square feet or less of impervious surface. 
                  User is defined as any person who uses property, which maintains connection to, discharges to, or otherwise receives services from the city for stormwater management.

The stormwater utility shall apportion the cost of delivering stormwater services to all developed properties based on the demand the property places on the city's stormwater management program and the stormwater services provided by the city. 
                  (b)  Stormwater user fee charge rates shall be set and may be modified from time to time by the mayor and city council. A schedule of said rates shall be on file in the office of the city clerk of Garden City. In setting or modifying such rates, it shall be the goal of the city to establish rates that are fair, equitable and reasonable, and together with other funding sources available to the Garden City Stormwater Utility such as special service fees and charges deemed appropriate by the mayor and city council to customers for services, systems, and/or facilities related to stormwater management (e.g. credit application fees, plan review fees, development inspection fees, regulatory compliance inspection fees and other fees related to provision of stormwater management services), are sufficient to support the cost of the stormwater management services, including, but not limited to, the payment of principal and interest on debt obligations, lease payments, operating expenses, capital outlays, non-operating expenses, provisions for prudent reserves and other costs as deemed appropriate by the city. 
                  (c)  The basis for calculation of the stormwater user fee charge to all developed property within the city is established in this article. The city shall assign or determine the customer class, amount of impervious area and other pertinent factors as may be needed for the fair, reasonable and equitable allocation of the costs to deliver stormwater management services and to calculate the stormwater user fee charges for all developed properties in the city. 
                  (d)  Stormwater user fee charges shall be based upon the total number of residential equivalent units (REUs) associated with developed properties within the city. Each REU shall correspond to 3,000 square feet of impervious surface. 
                  (1)  Gravel and compacted soil driveways, parking areas, and roads on private property will be considered impervious surface and included in the customer's REU calculation because of the hydrologic response characteristics of these materials. However, the total surface area associated with these materials will be calculated at 90 percent of the total REUs to reflect the hydrologic response characteristics of these materials. Application of the 90 percent factor to these materials is based on applicable literature sources and reference documents outlined in the applicable sections of the project documents cited in section 30-282. 
                  (e)  Calculation of charges. The periodic stormwater user fee charges imposed on all developed properties shall be $4.75 multiplied by the number of REUs for each customer account. 
                  (1)  The number of REUs that will be utilized to calculate the user fee charge shall be in accordance with the following: 
                  a.  SFR customer class: Each SFR customer account shall be charged 1.0 REU per month unless one of the conditions outlined below applies: 
                  1.  If two customer accounts are assigned to a SFR property (i.e. a duplex) then each customer account on that parcel will be charged 0.5 REU per month for billing purposes. 
                  2.  If the SFR property has an impervious surface amount that exceeds 9,000 square feet (or three REUs) then a custom stormwater user fee bill will be calculated for the customer account using the NSFR user fee charge calculation approach outlined herein. 
                  b.  NSFR customer class: Each NSFR customer shall be charged one REU for each 3,000 square feet, or increment thereof, of impervious surface located on the property to establish the total number of REUs for billing. Fractional REUs will be rounded to one decimal place to establish the number of REUs for billing each month. 
                  c.  Undeveloped land customer class: Undeveloped land shall be assigned zero REUs and will not receive a stormwater user fee bill. 
                  (f)  Stormwater user fee charges shall be billed on the customer's monthly public utility bill (except as stipulated below) starting with the first billing cycle in February 2009 as called for in this article and the Stormwater Utility Enterprise Fund Ordinance. 
                  (1)  Customers that do not receive a monthly public utility bill from the city shall be billed for stormwater services via another method and frequency established by the city administrator. 
                  (2)  The property owner will be charged for the total impervious surface for residential customer accounts that are part of a larger common development such as manufactured home parks and apartment complexes. 
                  (3)  The city will generally bill the property owner's tenant for the stormwater user fee charge in situations where the tenant has opened an account with the city for public utility services (i.e., water, sewer, and/or sanitation). In selected cases, it may be necessary for the city to bill the landlord or property owner for stormwater services where accurate and equitable apportionment of the user fee charges to multiple accounts on a site is not practical.

                  Sec. 30-285. - Stormwater user fee charge exemptions. 
                  (a)  Except as provided in this section or otherwise provided by law, no developed public or private property located in the incorporated area of the city shall be exempt from the stormwater user fee charges. No exception, credit, offset, or other reduction in stormwater user fee charges shall be granted based on age, tax status, economic status, race, religion, disability, or other condition unrelated to the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management program services and facilities. 
                  (b)  Exemptions to the stormwater user fee charges are as follows: 
                  (1)  Parcels which contain 500 square feet, or less, of impervious surfaces shall be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. 
                  (2)  Railroad rights-of-way (tracks) shall be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. This exemption is in recognition of routine drainage system maintenance and capital construction activities undertaken by the rail road company associated with rights-of-way and drainage conveyance systems. However, railroad stations, yards, maintenance buildings, and/or other improved property used for railroad operations shall not be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. 
                  (3)  Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) streets and rights-of-way shall be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. This exemption is in recognition of routine drainage system maintenance and capital construction activities undertaken by GDOT in association with GDOT rights-of-way road and drainage conveyance systems. However, maintenance buildings and/or other improved property used for GDOT purposes shall not be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. All other state, federal, and county improved properties are subject to the user fee charges on the same basis as private properties. 
                  (4)  Chatham County owned public streets and rights-of-way shall be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. This exemption is in recognition of routine drainage system maintenance and capital construction services undertaken by the county. However, other improved property used for county purposes shall not be exempt from stormwater user fee charges.

                  Sec. 30-286. - Stormwater user fee charge credits. 
                  (a)  The Stormwater utility manager shall grant credits or adjustments based on the technical and procedural criteria set forth in the Stormwater Utility Credit Manual (credit manual), which is incorporated into this division by reference and made a part hereof. Copies of the credit manual will be maintained by and made available from the stormwater utility manager. 
                  (1)  Customers may apply for credits and/or adjustments in accordance with the credit manual. 
                  (2)  A stormwater user fee charge credit shall be determined based on the technical requirements, standards and criteria contained in the credit manual. The amount of credit, or reduction of the stormwater user fee charge, shall be in accordance with the criteria contained in the credit manual. 
                  (3)  Any credit allowed against the stormwater user fee charge is conditioned on continuing compliance with the city's design and performance standards as stated in the credit manual and/or upon continuing provision of the controls, systems, facilities, services, and activities provided, operated, and maintained by the customer. The stormwater utility manager may revoke a credit at any time for noncompliance with applicable standards and criteria as established in the credit manual or this article. 
                  (4)  In order to obtain a credit, the customer must make application to the city on forms provided by the stormwater utility manager for such purpose, and in accordance with the procedures outlined in the credit manual. 
                  (5)  The application for any credit or adjustment must be in writing and must include the information necessary to establish eligibility for the credit or adjustment, and be in the format described in the credit manual. The customer's public utility account must be paid and current prior to review and approval of a stormwater utility credit application by the city. Incomplete applications will not be accepted for consideration and processing. 
                  (b)  When an application for a credit is deemed complete by the stormwater utility manager, he/she shall have 30 days from the date the complete application is received to approve the credit in whole, approve the credit in part, or deny the credit. The stormwater utility manager's decision shall be in writing and will be mailed to the address provided on the adjustment request, and service shall be complete upon mailing. Credits applied for by the customer and approved in whole or in part, shall apply to all stormwater user fee charges in accordance with the terms defined in the credit manual.

                  Sec. 30-287. - Stormwater user fee charge billing, delinquencies, collections, adjustments. 
                  Failure to receive a stormwater utility user fee charge bill is not justification for nonpayment. The property owner and/or utility customer account holder, as identified from city public utility billing database information and public land records of Chatham County, shall be obligated to pay the applicable stormwater user fee charge. 
                  (1)  Billing. 
                  a.  Stormwater user fee charges shall begin to accrue February 1, 2009, and shall be billed prospectively. A bill for stormwater user fee charges may be sent through the United States Postal Service or by alternative means, notifying the stormwater utility customer of the following items (as a minimum): the stormwater user fee charge amount (less any approved credits), the date the payment is due and the date when payment is past due. 
                  b.  Unless otherwise billed directly to the property owner, the stormwater user fee charge will be billed and collected on a common statement and collected along with other city utility services from the person in whose name such services have been placed on account with the city. If and when the account is closed or becomes delinquent, the bills for unpaid previous service as well as for current and future service shall be sent to the property owner. 
                  c.  Frequency of the billing of stormwater user fee charges shall be specified by the city administrator. 
                  d.  Failure to receive a bill shall not be justification for nonpayment. Regardless of the party to whom the bill is initially directed, the owner of each developed property subject to stormwater user fee charges shall be ultimately obligated to pay stormwater user fee charges and any interest at the rate of 18 percent per annum on delinquent stormwater user fee charge payments. 
                  e.  If a property is unbilled, or if no bill is sent for a particular tract of developed property, the stormwater utility may back bill for a period of up to one year, but shall not be entitled to any interest or any delinquency charges during the back billed period. 
                  (2)  Delinquencies and collections. 
                  a.  Unpaid stormwater service fees shall be collected by filing suit to collect on an unpaid account and by using all methods allowed by Georgia law to collect on any judgment obtained thereby, including enforcement of any lien resulting from any such judgment. Unless reduced to a judgment and a writ of fieri facias issued, the unpaid user fee charge shall not constitute a direct lien against the owner and/or the property. 
                  b.  A late charge shall be assessed against the customer for the unpaid balance of any stormwater utility user fee charge that becomes delinquent in accordance with applicable state law and city ordinance provisions. In addition, the city shall assess all costs of collection, including attorney's fees and court costs, against the property owner. 
                  (3)  Adjustments. 
                  a.  The stormwater utility manager shall administer the procedures and standards for the adjustment of the stormwater user fee charge. 
                  1.  If a customer believes his/her stormwater user fee is incorrect, the customer may seek an adjustment of the stormwater user fee charge allocated to a property at any time by submitting the request in writing to the stormwater utility manager and setting forth in detail the grounds upon which relief is sought. The customer's public utility account must be paid and current prior to consideration of an adjustment request by the city. 
                  2.  Customers requesting the adjustment shall be required, at their own expense, to provide accurate impervious area and other supplemental information to the stormwater utility manager, including, but not limited to, a survey certified by a registered land surveyor or a professional engineer. 
                  Submittal of this information will be required if the city staff cannot make a determination based on field inspection and/or review of existing city aerial photography. Failure to provide the required information within the time limits established by the stormwater utility manager, as may be reasonably extended, may result in denial of the customer's adjustment request. 
                  3.  Once a completed adjustment request and all required information are received by the stormwater utility manager, the stormwater utility manager shall within 30 calendar days render a written decision. 
                  4.  In considering an adjustment request, the stormwater utility manager shall consider whether the calculation of the stormwater user fee charge for the property is correct. 
                  5.  The stormwater utility manager's decision shall be in writing and will be mailed to the address provided on the adjustment request, and service shall be complete upon mailing. 
                  6.  If the result of an adjustment is that a refund is due the applicant, the refund will be applied as a credit on the applicant's next stormwater user fee charge bill.

                  (a)  Appeals. An appeal to the city administrator may be taken by any property owner or customer aggrieved by any decision of the stormwater utility manager. The appeal shall be taken within 30 days of the decision of the stormwater utility manager by filing with the city administrator a notice of appeal in writing specifying the grounds thereof. Upon the filing of the notice of appeal, the stormwater utility manager shall forthwith transmit to the city administrator all documentation constituting the record upon which the decision appealed from was taken. 
                  (b)  Hearing. The city administrator shall fix a reasonable time for hearing the appeal and give written notice to the appellant at least ten days prior to the hearing date. The notice shall indicate the place, date and time of the hearing. The city administrator shall affirm, reverse, affirm in part, or reverse in part the decision of the stormwater utility manager after hearing the evidence. If the decision of the stormwater utility manager is reversed in whole or in part, resulting in a refund or credit due to the property owner or customer, then such refund or credit shall be calculated retroactive to the date of the initial appeal. The decision of the city administrator shall be final, and there shall be no further administrative action. Any person aggrieved or dissatisfied with the decision of the city administrator may petition the Superior Court of Chatham County for Writ of Certiorari.

                  Sec. 30-350. - Title. 
                  This article shall be known and may be cited as the "Wetlands Protection Ordinance."

                  Sec. 30-351. - Purpose and intent. 
                  Wetlands are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion, and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; and open space and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the well being of communities in the State of Georgia. Nationally, a considerable number of wetlands have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution and other activities. Without additional regulation, piecemeal or cumulative losses of wetlands will continue to occur over time. Therefore, it is in the interest of public safety and general welfare to avoid damage or destruction to wetlands. The purpose of this article is to promote wetlands protection by adopting a generalized wetlands map; provide for the withholding of land use and building permits in areas designated as wetlands until a jurisdictional wetland determination is completed; and establish permitted and prohibited land uses within wetlands shown on the generalized wetlands map.

                  Sec. 30-352. - Definitions. 
                  Generalized wetlands map means a map of wetlands provided in the City's/County's comprehensive plan and/or any U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) map showing wetlands within the local jurisdiction. 
                  Jurisdictional wetland means an area that meets the definitional requirements for wetlands as determined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
                  Jurisdictional wetland determination means a delineation of jurisdictional wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. § 1344, as amended. 
                  Regulated activity means any activity which will, or which may reasonably be expected to, result in the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the U.S. excepting those activities exempted in Section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act. 
                  Wetlands means those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas. The ecological parameters for designating wetlands include hydric soils, hydrophytic vegetation, and hydrological conditions that involve a temporary or permanent source of water to cause soil saturation.

                  (1)  The coverage for such services is expressly provided by the insurance company to the insured and the services are lawfully billed to the insured; or where 
                  (2)  Emergency medical services are provided to the insured by the county or municipal corporation, whenever the insured's medical insurance covers the service provided and the insured assigns the right to collect to the service provider; or where

The fees will be determined by certain mitigation rates set forth in the Garden City Regulatory Fee Rate Schedule approved by the mayor and council. 
                  (c)  The city manager shall institute processes necessary for fire department reporting, municipal court tracking of traffic citations, and finance department direct billing of the fees authorized by this Code section, and may cause the functions and duties required by this subparagraph (c) to be provided using any of the procurement methods provided by this Code and state law. 
                  (d)  The fees shall only apply to persons who are not residents of the city.

                  ARTICLE III. - FIRE PROTECTION UTILITY ENTERPRISE FUND 

                  Sec. 34-71. - Purpose. 
                  This article establishes the Garden City Fire Protection Utility and sets up the fire protection utility enterprise fund. 
                  (Ord. No. 2010-15, § 1, 10-18-10) 
                  Sec. 34-72. - Findings of fact. 
                  The Garden City Mayor and City Council make the following findings of fact: 
                  (1)  The City of Garden City is authorized by the Georgia Constitution of 1983, including, without limitation, Article IX, Section II, Paragraph VI thereof, to create special service districts for the provision of services within such districts, and to levy and collect within such districts fees and assessments to pay, wholly or partially, the cost of providing such services therein. 
                  (2)  The City of Garden City, Georgia, is authorized by its Charter to fix and establish fire protection service area limits and to extend, enlarge or restrict same from time to time to ensure effective delivery of such services. 
                  (3)  In promulgating the provisions contained in this Article, Garden City is acting pursuant to its authority as granted by the Georgia Constitution, and the laws of the State of Georgia and its City Charter, to provide fire protection and emergency management services to all properties within the city's service area. Fire protection and emergency management services are needed and provide benefits to all properties within the city's service area. For the purposes of this ordinance, fire protection services shall be inclusive of emergency management services. 
                  (4)  The cost of managing, operating and maintaining the Garden City Fire Department, and the funding necessary for equipment, personnel and facilities thereof should, to the extent practicable, be allocated in reasonable relationship to the services received by the public from the city's fire department and the fire protection program. 
                  (5)  The operational and financing analysis prepared by the city properly assesses and defines the city's fire protection program service delivery needs, goals, priorities as well as the city fire department's funding strategy for delivery of those services. 
                  (6)  Given the city's fire protection program service delivery needs, goals, priorities and the funding strategy identified in the aforementioned financing analysis, it is appropriate to authorize the formation of an organizational and accounting entity dedicated specifically to the management, maintenance, protection, control, regulation, use, and enhancement of fire protection services, systems and facilities within the city in concert with other resource management programs. 
                  (7)  Fire protection services are applicable and needed throughout the incorporated areas of the city. While specific service and facility demands may differ from area to area at any given point in time, one service area encompassing all lands within the designated Garden City Fire Protection Utility Service Area is consistent with the present and future needs of the community. 
                  (8)  It is practical and equitable to allocate the cost of fire protection among the owners and/or occupants of all properties in proportion to the demands the properties impose on the city's fire department which result in services being rendered to such properties and the owners and/or occupants thereof. The fair and equitable apportionment of costs via the service fee charge should be based on a reasonable correlation to the fire protection services made available and provided to all properties. 
                  (9)  The fire protection needs of the city include, but are not limited to, protection of the public health, safety, and welfare of the community. Provision of fire protection services renders and/or results in both a service and a benefit to all properties, property owners, citizens, and residents of the city. 
                  (10)  A fire protection program provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering fire protection services throughout the city, and the most equitable means to implement the defined level of service for fire protection within the city are through fire protection service fee charges and other funding mechanisms. 
                  (11)  A schedule of fire protection service fee charges based on the needed fire flow amount for all properties of different customer classes (i.e., single-family residential, non-single-family residential and undeveloped land [all as defined herein]) per the methodology outlined in the Insurance Services Office (ISO) "Guide for Determination of Needed Fire Flow", Edition 05-2008. The fire protection fees for customers are based on a residential equivalent unit (REU) basis as this methodology is the most appropriate and equitable means of allocating the cost of fire protection services throughout the city. 
                  (12)  Fire protection service fee charges may be supplemented by other types of fees and charges which address specific needs, including, but not limited to, special service fees, general fund revenues, special assessments, use of proceeds from special purpose local option sales taxes (SPLOST) and other forms of revenue, as deemed appropriate by the mayor and city council. 
                  (13)  The existence of privately owned and maintained on-site fire protection/suppression facilities or systems which reduce, or otherwise mitigate, the response burden imposed on the fire department, and the fire protection utility's cost of providing fire protection services, should be taken into account with regard a potential reduction to the service fee charge on that property in the form of a service fee charge reduction or a credit, and such credit should be conditioned upon continuing provision of such facilities in a manner complying with the standards and codes as determined by the fire protection utility. Credits for privately owned and maintained fire protection/suppression facilities, systems and/or programs shall be generally proportional to the effect that such facilities, systems and programs have on reduction and/or mitigation of the fire risk and incident response burden associated with the property and the reduction in cost associated with provision of fire protection services related to that property. 
                  (14)  It is imperative that the revenue from all service fee charges for fire protection services, systems or facilities, be dedicated solely to those purposes, and such service fee charge revenues shall therefore be deposited into the city fire protection utility enterprise fund and shall remain in that fund and be dispersed only for fire protection capital and operations costs, or for other indebtedness for fire protection services. 
                  (15)  In order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public, the governing authority of Garden City hereby concludes a fire protection utility, funded by a dedicated fire protection utility enterprise fund, is warranted as the best available means of addressing the community's fire protection service delivery needs. By separate ordinance, the city will enact a service charge rate structure to establish service fees for the provision of fire protection services to all properties within the defined Garden City Fire Protection Utility Service Area.

                  (a)  The fire protection utility shall establish specified customer classes within the defined Garden City Fire Protection Utility Service Area to reflect differences in building structure and contents; needed fire flow; fire protection and emergency management services provided by the GCFD to the fire protection utility customers; and the respective demand that those customers' properties place on the GCFD operations and equipment and fire protection and emergency management services. For the purposes of this article, fire protection services shall be inclusive of emergency management services. 
                  (b)  The fire protection utility classes will encompass all developed and undeveloped properties within the city and are defined as follows:

                  Sec. 34-104. - Fire protection fee charge rates. 
                  (a)  The fire protection utility shall impose a fire protection fee on all properties within the service area in a fair and equitable manner. All state, federal, and county properties are subject to the user fee charges on the same basis as private properties. The fire protection utility shall apportion the cost of delivering fire protection services to all properties based on the demand the property places on the GCFD and the fire protection services provided. 
                  (b)  Fire protection fee charge rates shall be set and may be modified from time to time by the governing body of the city. A schedule of said rates shall be on file in the office of the city clerk of Garden City. In setting or modifying such rates, it shall be the goal of the city to establish rates that are fair, equitable and reasonable, and together with other funding sources available to the Garden City Fire Protection Utility for services, systems, and/or facilities related to fire protection services are sufficient to support the cost of the GCFD, including, but not limited to, the payment of principal and interest on debt obligations, lease payments, operating expenses, capital outlays, nonoperating expenses, provisions for prudent reserves and other costs as deemed appropriate by the city. 
                  (c)  The basis for calculation of the fire protection fee charge to all properties within the city is established in this article. The city shall assign or determine the customer class, needed fire flow, and other pertinent factors as may be needed for the fair, reasonable and equitable allocation of the costs to deliver fire protection services and to calculate the fire protection fee charges for all properties in the city. 
                  (d)  Fire protection fee charges shall be based upon the total number of REUs associated with a property located in the city. Each REU shall correspond to 500 gpm of needed fire flow. 
                  (e)  Calculation of charges. The periodic fire protection fee charges imposed on all properties shall be $5.00 multiplied by the number of REUs for each customer account. 
                  (1)  The number of REUs that will be utilized to calculate the user fee charge shall be in general accordance with the following: 
                  a.  SFR Customer Class: Each SFR customer account shall be charged 1.0 REU per month except as noted herein. 
                  b.  NSFR Customer Class: Each NSFR customer shall be charged 1.0 REU for each 500 gpm, or increment thereof, of needed fire flow for the property to establish the total number of REUs for billing. Fractional REUs will be rounded to the nearest 0.25 REU, if less than 5.0 REUs, or the nearest 0.5 REU if greater than 5.0 REUs for billing each month. 
                  1.  The maximum number of billing units to be charged to any NSFR account will be 24.0 REU, representative of a fire flow of 12,000 gpm, which is the maximum recommended amount of fire flow per the ISO Manual. 
                  2.  The maximum number of billing units to be charged to any apartment building or multifamily dwelling shall be 7.0 REUs, which is consistent with the maximum recommended fire flow of 3,500 gpm for this type of multifamily residential structure. 
                  3.  The number of billing units to be charged per manufactured home structure located within a manufactured home park that is under a single landlord/ownership entity is 0.5 billing units, which is consistent with the estimated needed fire flow of 250 gpm for a single-wide manufactured home structure. 
                  c.  Undeveloped Property Customer Class: Each undeveloped property shall be charged in accordance with the table below to establish the total number of REUs for billing. 
                  1.  Needed fire flow for an undeveloped property that does not meet the criteria below under subsection c.2. will be calculated in accordance with the following table: 

                   
                  2.  Fire protection utility customers who are paying a fire protection fee for developed property, shall not be charged separately for directly adjacent parcels that are undeveloped. 
                  (f)  Fire protection user fee charges shall be billed on the customer's monthly public utility bill (except as stipulated below) starting with the first billing cycle in January 2011 as provided in this article and the Fire Protection Utility Enterprise Fund Ordinance. 
                  (1)  Customers that do not receive a monthly public utility bill from the city shall be billed for fire protection services via another method and frequency established by the city. 
                  (2)  The property owner will be charged for the total needed fire flow for residential customer accounts that are part of a larger common development such as multifamily complexes or manufactured home parks. 
                  (3)  The city may bill the property owner's tenant for the fire protection fee charge in situations where the tenant has opened an account with the city for public utility services (i.e., water, sewer, and/or sanitation) as a courtesy to the property owner. The property owner shall remain ultimately liable for payment of the fire protection fee charge imposed on the property. The city shall be authorized to bill the landlord or property owner for fire protection services where accurate and equitable apportionment of the fire protection fee charges to multiple accounts on a site is not practical as determined by the city, and/or to facilitate efficient billing and collection of fire protection fee charges.

                  Sec. 34-105. - Fire protection fee charge exemptions. 
                  (a)  Except as provided in this section or otherwise provided for by law, no developed or undeveloped, public or private property located in the fire protection utility service area shall be exempt from the fire protection fee charge. The fire protection fee charge is not a tax and no exception, credit, offset, or other reduction in fire protection fee charges shall be granted based on age, tax status, economic status, race, religion, disability, or other condition unrelated to the fire protection utility's cost of providing fire protection services and facilities. 
                  (b)  Exemptions to the fire protection fee charge are as follows: 
                  (1)  Linear rights-of-way (i.e. roads, tracks, rails, roadbed) outside of defined parcel limits shall be exempt from fire protection fee charge. This exemption is in recognition of the right of the GCFD to collect emergency response fees for emergency response services provided within the right-of-way.

                  (1)  Customers may apply for credits and/or adjustments in accordance with the credit manual. 
                  (2)  A fire protection fee credit shall be determined based on the technical requirements, standards and criteria contained in the credit manual. The amount of credit, or reduction of the fire protection fee, shall be in accordance with the criteria contained in the credit manual. 
                  (3)  Any credit allowed against the fire protection fee charge is conditioned on continuing compliance with the city's design and performance standards as stated in the credit manual and upon continuing provision of the controls, systems, facilities, services, and activities provided, operated, and maintained by the customer. The fire chief may revoke a credit at any time for noncompliance with applicable standards and criteria as established in the credit manual or this article. 
                  (4)  In order to obtain a credit, the customer must make application to the city on forms provided by the fire chief for such purpose, and in accordance with the procedures outlined in the credit manual. 
                  (5)  The application for any credit or adjustment must be in writing and must include the information necessary to establish eligibility for the credit or adjustment, and be in the format described in the credit manual. The customer's public utility account must be paid and current prior to review and approval of a fire protection fee credit application by the city. Incomplete applications will not be accepted for consideration and processing. 
                  (b)  When an application for a credit is deemed complete by the fire chief, he/she shall have 30 days from the date the complete application is received to approve the credit in whole, approve the credit in part, or deny the credit.

                  (1)  Adjustments. 
                  a.  The fire chief shall administer the procedures and standards for the adjustment of the fire protection fee charge. 
                  1.  If a customer believes his fire protection fee is incorrect, the customer may seek an adjustment of the fire protection fee charge allocated to a property at any time by submitting the request in writing to the fire chief and setting forth in detail the grounds upon which relief is sought. The customer's public utility account must be paid and current prior to consideration of an adjustment request by the city. 
                  2.  Customers requesting the adjustment shall be required, at their own expense, to provide accurate information to the fire chief, including, but not limited to, inspection reports from a certified fire protection professional or building construction plans certified by a registered architect or a professional engineer. Submittal of this information will be required if the city staff cannot make a determination based on field inspection and/or review of existing city information. Failure to provide the required information within the time limits established by the fire chief, as may be reasonably extended, may result in denial of the customer's adjustment request. 
                  3.  Once a completed adjustment request and all required information are received by the fire chief, the fire chief shall within 30 calendar days render a written decision. 
                  4.  In considering an adjustment request, the fire chief shall consider whether the calculation of the fire protection fee charge for the property is correct. 
                  5.  The fire chief's decision shall be in writing and will be mailed to the address provided on the adjustment request, and service shall be complete upon mailing. 
                  6.  If the result of an adjustment is that a refund is due the applicant, the refund will be applied as a credit on the applicant's next fire protection fee charge bill.

                  Sec. 38-1. - Statutory authorization. 
                  Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a) have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the mayor and council of Garden City, Georgia, does ordain as follows: 
                  (Ord. No. 2018-11, § 1, 6-4-18) 
                  Sec. 38-2. - Findings of fact. 
                  (a)  The flood hazard areas of Garden City, Georgia are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (b)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
                  (Ord. No. 2018-11, § 1, 6-4-18) 
                  Sec. 38-3. - Statement of purpose. 
                  It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion, and; 
                  (4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; 
                  (5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters. 
                  (Ord. No. 2018-11, § 1, 6-4-18) 
                  Sec. 38-4. - Objectives. 
                  The objectives of this chapter are: 
                  (1)  To protect human life and health; 
                  (2)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
                  (3)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas, 
                  (4)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
                  (5)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
                  (6)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions, and; 
                  (7)  To insure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

                  In all areas of special flood hazard designated as A1-30, AE, AH, A (with engineered or estimated BFE), the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and substantial improvement of any structure including manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with standards of article IV, section 38-30(4), "Elevated Buildings". 
                  a.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  (2)  Non-residential construction. New construction and the substantial improvement of any structure including manufactured housing, may be flood-proofed in lieu of elevation. (not applicable for coastal high hazard areas.) The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in article III, section 38-22(7). An operation and maintenance plan shall be prepared to assure the continued viability of floodproofing measures. 
                  (3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
                  a.  All manufactured homes placed and substantially improved on: (1) individual lots or parcels, (2) in new and substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, (3) in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or (4) on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  b.  Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that: 
                  1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation, or 
                  2.  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 48 inches in height above grade. 
                  c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (ref. article IV, section 38-30(6)). 
                  d.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
                  1.  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days. 
                  2.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions), or 
                  3.  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "new construction," including the anchoring and elevation requirements of article IV, section 38-31(3)(c), above. 
                  (4)  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in article II, section 38-11, are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during the base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting analysis, technical data and certification thereof. 
                  b.  Only if article IV, section 38-31(4)a. above is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of article IV.

                  Sec. 38-32. - Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations and floodway (A-zones). 
                  Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in article II, section 38-11, where streams exist but no base flood data and floodway data have been provided (A-Zones), the following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  For subdivisions and developments greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is less, base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision and all other proposed development, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions. Any changes or revisions to the flood data adopted herein and shown on the FIRM shall be submitted to FEMA for review as a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) or conditional letter of map amendment (CLOMA), whichever is applicable. Upon completion of the project, the developer is responsible for submitting the "as-built" data to FEMA in order to obtain the final LOMR. 
                  (2)  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with article II, section 38-11, then the building official shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a Federal, State, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of article IV. Only if data is not available from these sources, the provisions of article IV, section 38-32(2) and (3) shall apply. 
                  (3)  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 25 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in more than one foot increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
                  (4)  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site.

                  Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in article II, section 38-11, are areas designated as coastal high hazard areas (V-Zones). These areas have special flood hazards associated with wave action and storm surge, therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  (1)  All new construction and substantial improvements shall be located landward of the reach of mean high tide; 
                  (2)  All new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be elevated on piles, columns, or shear walls parallel to the flow of water so that the bottom of the lowest supporting horizontal structural member (excluding pilings or columns) is located no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation level. All space below the lowest supporting member shall remain free of obstruction or constructed with non-supporting breakaway walls. Open wood lattice work or decorative screening may be permitted for aesthetic purposes only and must be designed to wash away in the event of abnormal wave action and in accordance with article IV, section 38-35(6); 
                  (3)  All new construction and substantial improvements shall be securely anchored on pilings, or columns; 
                  (4)  All pile and column foundations and the structures attached thereto shall be anchored to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement due to the combined effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components, both (non-structural and structural). Water loading values shall equal or exceed those associated with the base flood. Wind loading values shall be in accordance with the most current edition of the Georgia State adopted Standard Building Code. 
                  (5)  A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design, specifications and plans for construction are in compliance with the provisions contained in article IV, subsections 38-35(2), (3) and (4). 
                  (6)  All space below the lowest horizontal supporting member must remain free of obstruction. Open wood lattice work or decorative screening may be permitted for aesthetic purposes only and must be designed to wash away in the event of abnormal wave action without causing structural damage to the supporting foundation or elevated portion of the structure. The following design specifications are allowed: 
                  a.  No solid walls shall be allowed, and; 
                  b.  Material shall consist of open wood lattice or insect screening only; and 
                  c.  If aesthetic open wood lattice work or screening is utilized, any enclosed space shall not be used for human habitation, but shall be designed to be used only for parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises. 
                  (7)  Prior to construction, plans for any structures having open wood latticework or insect screening must be submitted to the building official for approval; 
                  (8)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to any structure shall not enclose the space below the lowest floor except with open wood latticework or decorative screening, as provided in this section. 
                  (9)  There shall be no fill used as structural support, or to elevate areas used for septic tank drain fields. Limited non-compacted fill may be used around the perimeter of a building for landscaping/aesthetic purposes provided the fill will wash out from storm surge, (thereby rendering the building free of obstruction) prior to generating excessive loading forces, ramping effects, or wave deflection. The building official may approve design plans for landscaping/aesthetic fill only after the applicant has provided an analysis by an engineer, architect or soil scientist, which demonstrates that the following factors have been fully evaluated: 
                  a.  Particle composition of fill material does not have a tendency for excessive natural compaction; 
                  b.  Volume and distribution of fill will not cause wave deflection to adjacent properties; and 
                  c.  Slope of fill will not cause wave run-up or ramping. 
                  (10)  There shall be no alteration of sand dunes or mangrove stands, which would increase potential flood damage; 
                  (11)  Prohibit the placement of manufactured homes (mobile homes), except in an existing manufactured homes park or subdivision. A replacement manufactured home may be placed on a lot in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision provided the anchoring standards of article IV, section 38-31(c) are met.

                  (c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the board of appeals may appeal such decision to the Superior Court of Chatham County, Georgia, as provided in state law. 
                  (d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of Historic Structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a Historic Structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (g)  In reviewing such requests, the board of appeals shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this chapter. 
                  (h)  Conditions for variances: 
                  (1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause, 
                  b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship, and;

                  Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. (Permanent construction does not include initial land Preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (Note: accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance requirements) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. 
                  Subdivision the division of a single lot into two or more lots for the purpose of sale or development. 
                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
                  Substantial improvement means any combination of repairs, reconstruction, alteration, or improvements to a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. NOTE: The market value of the structure should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. The term does not, however, include: 
                  (1)  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions. 
                  For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the structure commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. 
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  Sec. 46-29. - False alarm service fee. 
                  (a)  Established. To discourage excessive false alarms at any single residential or commercial location, enhance the safety of officers of the city police and fire departments, protect the lives and property of the citizens of the city, reduce unnecessary use of police and fire department resources, and produce revenues to defray the costs of police and fire department responses to false alarms, a false alarm service fee is hereby established. 
                  (b)  Definitions. [The following terms, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed below:] 
                  (1)  Alarm system means an assembly of equipment and devices arranged to signal the presence of a hazard requiring urgent attention by the city police and/or fire department. 
                  (2)  False alarm means an alarm and alarm signal eliciting notification to and response by the police or fire department when there is no evidence of a crime, fire, or other activity that warrants a call for immediate police or fire department assistance and no person who was on or near the property or has viewed a video communication from the property called for the police or fire dispatch or confirmed the need for police or fire department assistance. "False alarm" does not include an alarm signal caused by violent conditions of nature or other extraordinary circumstances beyond the control of the alarm user (i.e., acts of God). 
                  (c)  Rates. The owner or lessee of any residential or commercial property with an alarm system shall pay to the City of Garden City a fee for each false alarm responded to by the police or fire departments within a calendar year. For the first three false alarms, there shall be no fee, but a warning in writing shall be given. For the fourth and all further responses in any calendar year, the following fees shall apply: 

                   
                  (d)  Exceptions. Each of the following circumstances shall not constitute a false alarm and no fee shall be assessed: 
                  (1)  Alarm conditions activated by a person working on the alarm system with prior notification to the city police and/or fire department. 
                  (2)  Alarms which can be substantiated as being activated by electrical interruptions, floods, storm conditions, or other natural disasters. 
                  (e)  Appeal. Any owner or lessee of an alarmed premises may appeal the assessment of a false alarm service fee to the city administrator. Such appeal shall be in writing and filed with the city administrator within ten days of the notification of the assessment. Upon appeal, the city administrator may consider the facts and circumstances of the false alarm (i.e., whether the false alarm was caused by violent conditions of nature or other extraordinary circumstances beyond the control of the alarm user), and other relevant information. 
                  (f)  Shutoff devices on alarm systems. Alarm systems employing audible signals shall be equipped with shutoff devices that automatically silence the audible signal 20 minutes after the alarm is initially activated. 
                  (g)  Maintenance to minimize false alarms; response by owner of commercial property. The owner or lessee of any residential or commercial property with an alarm system shall maintain the premises and alarm system in a manner that will minimize or eliminate false alarms. The owner or lessee of any commercial property with an alarm system shall respond or cause their representative to appear at the system location within a reasonable period of time when notified by the city police or fire department or monitoring company to provide access to the premises, deactivate the alarm system, or provide security at the alarm location. 
                  (h)  No response to frequent alarms; appeal of no-response determination. 
                  (1)  When the chief of police determines whether to make an immediate dispatch in response to notification of a signal from a security alarm system, the chief may disregard a call for police assistance when: 
                  a.  The call for assistance comes from an alarm system for a premises that has a record of sending more than three false alarms within a calendar year; and 
                  b.  The call is the only basis for making the dispatch. 
                  (2)  The chief may consider such a call for assistance as an additional factor in the chief's decision to order an immediate police response when an in-person call, verification from a person at or near the premises, or other independent evidence shows a need for immediate police assistance at the premises. 
                  (3)  To discourage alarms, the chief shall adopt a process of sending a letter or delivering other written notice informing the alarm user who has had a false alarm of the consequences of excessive false alarms, the need to take corrective action, and the prospect that more than three false alarms in a calendar year shall result in the police disregarding alarms from the premises and not responding to requests for immediate police assistance unless there is an in-person call for assistance from someone at or near the premises or other independent information that verifies the need for an immediate police response. 
                  (4)  Before determining not to respond to alarms from a premises as specified above, the chief shall send or deliver notice to the alarm user that: 
                  a.  More than three false alarms have been received from the property within a calendar year; 
                  b.  The remedy authorized in subsection (1), above, may be taken; 
                  c.  The alarm system user may request a hearing before the chief or the chief's designee and explain why the chief should not take the proposed action; 
                  d.  If no hearing is requested, the department will after ten days from the delivery of the notice disregard alarms from the premises unless there is an in-person call for assistance from someone at or near the premises or other independent information that verifies the need for an immediate police response; and 
                  e.  A requirement of an in-person communication or other verification shall remain in effect for a period of six months. 
                  (5)  If a hearing is requested, the chief shall schedule the hearing within ten days of the receipt of the request. At the hearing, the chief may consider such factors as the steps that the alarm user has taken, or is taking, to correct the problem; the incidents of crime in the area of the premises; the facts and circumstances of the false alarm; and other relevant information presented by the alarm user. 
                  (6)  The chief may suspend or cancel the remedy under subsection (1), above, if the chief determines that the alarm user has taken appropriate actions to prevent the recurrence of false alarms. 
                  (i)  Failure to pay. The payment of false alarm service fees billed to a business is a condition of that business operating within the city. The city administrator is authorized to withhold issuing or renewing a business license or business tax certificate to a business which has failed to pay a false alarm service fee. Any business which operates or continues to operate within the city when its business certificate or license has been withheld for nonpayment of the false alarm service fee will be deemed to be operating without a certificate or license, and will be subject to the penalties resulting therefrom.

                  ARTICLE IV. - BUSINESS TRAILERS 

                  Sec. 50-100. - Definitions. 
                  For the purposes of this article, the term "trailer" shall be defined to mean a vehicle on wheels or with the wheels removed, in the nature of a house trailer or such other structure commonly known as a house trailer, office trailer, manufactured home, or mobile home. The term "trailer" shall not include modular homes. 
                  (Ord. No. 2015-10, § 1, 12-7-15) 
                  Sec. 50-101. - Finding and intent. 
                  It is of increasing concern of the city council that numerous businesses are located within the city which have no permanently erected structure but are operating and conducting their businesses in trailers and have not commenced construction of a permanent structure for the conduct of their business nor applied for a building permit for such construction. The council further recognizes that great efforts have been made by the city to encourage industrial and commercial development and to attract businesses to permanently locate within the city limits. City council finds and declares that in order to ensure the proper development of commercial and industrial zoned areas within the city and to attract and encourage commercial and industrial developments, the practice of permitting businesses to operate out of trailers should no longer be permitted since it is incompatible with the desired development of the city. Accordingly, city council finds and declares that it is necessary to enact this article so as to prevent the continued operation of businesses out of trailers located within the city limit except under those certain conditions which are specifically set forth herein.

                  Sec. 62-166. - Findings. 
                  The mayor and council of Garden City, Georgia, hereby find that recycling will cause benefits by reducing demand on landfills and by conserving resources. Recycling will be encouraged and increased by having the city's waste management service equipment pick-up separated recyclable materials at residences utilizing roll-out carts for trash pick-up on a regular schedule. The mayor and council further find that, a survey of the residents having been taken and public hearings having been held, it appears that curbside pick-up of recyclable materials will be effective.

                  Sec. 62-167. - Pick-up by city's waste management service of certain recyclable materials from residences utilizing roll-out carts for trash pick-up.

                  (1)  Plastics (Category 1 (PETE), including drink bottles and milk trays); 
                  (2)  Plastics (Category 2 (PETE), including bottles for milk, washing up liquids, etc.); 
                  (3)  Glass (clear, brown, green); 
                  (4)  Aluminum/cans; and, 
                  (5)  Paper (including newspaper, cardboard, magazines, and phone books). 
                  The above-mentioned list is subject to change depending upon the increased or reduced capabilities of the city's waste management service provider. Persons desiring to take recyclables to pick-up locations operated by any public or private enterprise may do so, and thus bypass the city's curbside recycling program for some or all of their recycling needs.

                  Sec. 66-76. - Same—Abandoned or unusable cables. 
                  A permittee who has determined to discontinue its cable operations in the city must either (a) provide information satisfactory to the city that the permittee's obligations for its cables in the right-of-way under this chapter have been lawfully assumed by another permittee; or (b) submit to the city a proposal and instruments for transfer and ownership of its cables to the city. If a permittee proceeds under this clause, the city may, at its option, (a) purchase the equipment, or (b) require the permittee at its own expense, to remove it, or (c) require the permittee to post a bond in an amount sufficient to reimburse the city for reasonably anticipated costs to be incurred in removing the cables. Cables of a permittee who fails to comply with the proceeding paragraph and which, for two years, remains unused shall be deemed to abandoned. Abandoned equipment is deemed to be a nuisance. The city may exercise any remedies or rights it may have at law or in equity, including, but not limited to, (a) abating the nuisance, (b) taking possession of the cables and restoring them to a usable condition, or (c) requiring removal of the cables by the permittee or by the permittee's surety under the bond required hereunder. Any permittee who has unusable cables in any right-of-way shall remove them from that right-of-way unless this requirement is waived by the city.

                  Obtaining a right-of-way permit for the installation of fiber optic cables does not relieve the permittee of its duty to obtain all other necessary permits, licenses, and authority and to pay all fees required by any other governmental entity, or by laws or regulations. The permittee shall perform all work in conformance with all applicable codes and established rules and regulations, and it is responsible for all work done in the right-of-way pursuant to its permit, regardless of who performs the work. Except in the case of an emergency, and with the approval of the city administrator, no right-of-way excavation may be performed when conditions are unreasonable for such work.

                  Sec. 66-78. - Same—Revocation of permits. 
                  Permittees hold permits issued pursuant to this chapter for the installation of fiber optic cables as a privilege and not as a right. The city reserves its right, as provided herein, to revoke any right-of-way permit, without fee refund, in the event of a substantial breach of the terms and conditions of any statute, ordinance, rule or regulation, or any condition of the permit. If the city administrator determines that the permittee has committed a substantial breach of a term or condition of any statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, or any condition of the permit, the city administrator shall make a written demand upon the permittee to remedy such violation. The demand shall state that continued violations may be cause for revocation of the permit. Further, a substantial breach, as stated above, will allow the city administrator, at his discretion, to place additional or revised conditions on the permit. Within 24 hours of receiving notification of the breach, permittee shall contact the city administrator with a plan, acceptable to the city administrator, for its correction. Permittee's failure to so contact the city administrator, or the permittee's failure to submit an acceptable plan, or permittee's failure to reasonably implement the approved plan, shall be cause for immediate revocation of the permit. If the permit is revoked, the permittee shall also reimburse the city for the city's reasonable costs, including restoration costs and the costs of collection and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in connection with such revocation.

                  (3)  All drainage plans submitted by a licensed engineer must be approved by the city prior to any improvements being made. It is the responsibility of the applicant to include in the drainage plan sufficient information for the city to properly evaluate the plan and to inspect the work while being performed. 
                  (4)  Upon issuance of a permit, the person having the culvert installed must notify the city prior to covering the culvert and shall not cover the culvert until the work has been inspected by the city.

                  f.  All plats shall show the limits of the 100-year flood, where applicable. 
                  g.  All applications shall be accompanied by an indemnification agreement prepared by the city and executed by the developer, which agreement shall substantially be in the following form: 
                  INDEMNITY AGREEMENT 
                  WHEREAS, ____________ , the owner of the property (the "Property"), more particularly described on Exhibit "A" attached hereto, containing approximately ____________ acres, and located in Garden City, Georgia, desires to develop and/or make certain improvements to the Property and to obtain permits (for drainage, building, etc.) from Garden City for such improvements; and 
                  WHEREAS, the improvements which the owner wishes to make to the Property include storm water pipe, sanitary sewer, curb, gutter and pavement, as shown on drawings prepared by ____________ , Consulting Engineers, and dated ____________ / ____________ / ____________ (the "Plans"); and 
                  WHEREAS, Garden City requires the indemnification set forth below as a condition precedent to the owner's developing the Property and/or making the improvements shown on the Plans; 
                  NOW, THEREFORE, in order to induce the Mayor and Council to approve the preliminary subdivision plan and/or induce the City's Building Official to issue building and drainage permits to the owner, the owner agrees for itself, its officers, agents, assigns, and successors in title to the Property to indemnify and hold harmless Garden City, its officers, agents, and employees from any damages or claims for damage arising out of (a) the construction, maintenance, or use of the storm pipe and storm water detention facilities shown on the Plans, or (b) the run-off or discharge of surface water from the Property. This is a covenant running with the Property. 
                  IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the owner has caused this Indemnity Agreement to be duly executed under seal this ____________ day of ____________ , 1994.

                  (c)  Filing. 
                  (1)  The preliminary plan shall be filed with the planning commission not less than 20 days prior to the regular planning commission meeting at which it is to be considered. 
                  (2)  There shall be a fee charged for the review of a preliminary plan by the planning commission in an amount equal to $15.00 for every lot in the proposed subdivision. 
                  (d)  Review and approval. 
                  (1)  If the planning commission finds that the proposed design of the subdivision shown on the preliminary plan complies with the design requirements of this chapter, it shall recommend approval of such preliminary plan to the mayor and council. If the planning commission finds that the proposed design of the subdivision shown on the preliminary plan does not comply with the design requirements of this chapter, then the planning commission shall either recommend disapproval of such plan or shall recommend approval of such plan on the condition that specified violations are corrected prior to the submittal of the final plat. When the mayor and council recommend disapproval of a preliminary plan, they shall give the developer the reasons for such disapproval in writing. 
                  (2)  Except where an extension of time is authorized by the applicant for preliminary plan review, the planning commission shall have 30 days from the date of the submittal of a preliminary plan to act on such plan. Unless action is taken on an application for preliminary plan review within the 30-day period, a written recommendation of approval shall be issued by the planning commission on the demand of the applicant. The mayor and council, upon receipt of a recommendation from the planning commission, shall hold a public hearing thereon and shall notify in writing all abutting property owners and the developer of the subdivision of the time, date and place of the hearing. The mayor and council may either approve, disapprove or require modifications to the subdivision plat. 
                  (e)  Effect of approval. When a developer receives approval of the preliminary plan showing the design of his proposed subdivision, he may proceed with the construction of the subdivision. Such construction shall conform with the design submitted to and approved by the mayor and council. 
                  (f)  Time limit for beginning construction. The approval of a preliminary plan by the mayor and council shall be valid for one year. If work has not started on a subdivision which has been granted preliminary plan approval on or before the end of this one-year period, then the plan of such subdivision shall be resubmitted for preliminary approval; provided, however, that this time may be extended unless changes have occurred in this chapter or in the character of the property surrounding the property of the proposed subdivision which make it necessary to revise the design of the proposed subdivision as determined by the mayor and council. 
                  (Ord. of 4-2-84, § 1(8-2202); Ord. of 6-16-86, § 2; Ord. of 7-18-94(1), § 1; Ord. of 11-21-94(1), § 8) 
                  Sec. 70-35. - Final plat. 
                  (a)  Required. Before a plat of a subdivision is recorded with the clerk of the superior court of the county and the lots thereon offered for sale, an original and four prints of a final plat showing the final design of the subdivision shall be submitted to the planning commission for review. Until a final plat of a subdivision has been submitted to and reviewed by the planning commission and approved and signed by the mayor and clerk of the city, the clerk of the superior court of the county shall not record the plat of such subdivision, nor shall the owner or the agent of the owner of such subdivision be authorized to transfer or sell any of the land within such subdivision by reference to a plat. For large subdivisions the final plat may be submitted for approval progressively in contiguous sections satisfactory to the planning commission. 
                  (b)  Form and contents. The original copy of the final plat shall be drawn on 18-inch by 24-inch sheets of linen with black India ink at a scale of not less than 200 feet to the inch. Where necessary, the final plat may be drawn on several linen sheets accompanied by an index sheet showing the entire subdivision. The final plat shall contain the following information: 
                  (1)  Primary control points, to which all dimensions, angles, bearings and similar data on the plat shall be referred. 
                  (2)  Tract boundary lines, right-of-way lines of streets, easements and other rights-of-way, and property lines of all lots, in all cases with surveyed dimensions. Bearings or deflection angles, radii, arcs and central angles of all curves shall be shown. 
                  (3)  Name and right-of-way width of each street or other right-of-way. 
                  (4)  Location, dimensions and purpose of any easement. 
                  (5)  A number to identify each lot or site. 
                  (6)  The purpose for which sites other than residential lots are dedicated or reserved. 
                  (7)  Minimum building setback line on all lots and other sites. 
                  (8)  Location and identification of monuments. 
                  (9)  Names of record owners of adjoining unplatted land. 
                  (10)  Reference to recorded subdivision plats of adjoining platted land by record name. 
                  (11)  A certificate that all survey work was performed by a registered civil engineer or registered surveyor. 
                  (12)  A statement by the owner, on the plat, dedicating streets, rights-of-way, easements and any sites for public use. This statement shall be signed by the owner, or his attorney as agent, and shall read as follows: 
                  All streets, rights-of-way, easements and any sites for public use as noted on this plat are hereby dedicated for the use intended. 

                   
                  Such dedications must be formally and specifically accepted by the mayor and council before such dedications shall be binding on the city. 
                  (13)  Title, scale, north arrow and date. 
                  (14)  Key map showing the location of the subdivision in the city. 
                  (15)  The expected limits of the 100-year flood, where appropriate. 
                  (c)  Certification of approval of water supply and waste disposal system. If lots are not to be served by either public sewers or public water, or both, then the final plat shall be accompanied by a certificate from the county health department certifying health department approval of the water supply system and waste disposal system to be used and health department approval of lot sizes and lot widths established in such subdivision. 
                  (d)  Engineer's certificate; guarantee of improvements. At the time the final plat is submitted, it shall be accompanied by a certificate from the developer's engineer certifying that the subdivider has complied with both of the following conditions: 
                  (1)  All improvements have been installed in accord with the requirements of this chapter and chapter 38, pertaining to flood damage prevention, and in accord with the design approved by the mayor and council on the preliminary plan; and 
                  (2)  A bond, escrow account or certified check has been posted, which is available to the city, in sufficient amount to ensure the completion of all required improvements, as well as to ensure the maintenance thereof for a period of not more than 12 months after completion. The mayor and council may reduce the bond or escrow account 50 percent upon completion of construction. If no faults or failures develop, the remaining bond or escrow may be reduced an additional 50 percent at the end of six months. At the end of the second six months, the developer shall request an inspection, and if no faults or failures have developed the mayor and council shall release the bond or escrow. Such bond or escrow shall remain in force until released by the mayor and council after due inspection of the improvements, and shall not automatically expire at the end of 12 months. 
                  (e)  Filing. The final plat shall be filed with the planning commission not less than 20 days prior to a regular meeting of the planning commission. 
                  (f)  Review and approval; recording. 
                  (1)  If the planning commission finds that all the requirements of this chapter have been met, it shall recommend approval of the final plat and submit such plat to the mayor and council. If the planning commission finds that all the requirements of this chapter have not been met, after deficiencies have been discussed and reviewed with the sponsor and the sponsor has been given a period of time which shall not exceed 90 days to take corrective action, then the planning commission shall recommend disapproval of the final plat to the mayor and council and shall set forth its reasons for such recommendation in writing. Except where an extension of time is authorized by the applicant for final plat review, the planning commission shall have 30 days from the date of the submittal of a final plat to submit its recommendations on such plat to the mayor and council. Unless such action is taken within such 30-day period, such plat shall be deemed to have received a recommendation for approval from the planning commission, and the mayor and council may take final action on such plat without waiting further for the recommendations of the planning commission. 
                  (2)  When the final plat has been approved, the planning commission shall present the final plat to the clerk of the superior court of the county to be recorded. The planning commission shall provide the subdivider with the subdivision map book number and page number in which the subdivision has been recorded by the clerk of the superior court. The cost of such recording shall be paid by the subdivider and shall be deposited with the city clerk prior to such recording. 
                  (3)  After the final plat of the subdivision has been recorded, then all lots shown on such subdivision may be made available for sale and such subdivision shall be entitled to all privileges and services available to other subdivisions within the city. 
                  (g)  Revisions to recorded plat. 
                  (1)  Major revisions. The subdivider shall file with the planning commission copies of the proposed revision to a recorded plat, together with all supporting information as required by this chapter. Proposed revisions to a recorded plat which alter or change in any way the street or utility layout of the plat shall be submitted as a preliminary plan in accordance with section 70-36. 
                  (2)  Minor revisions. Proposed revisions to a recorded plat which do not alter or change in any way the street or utility layout of the plat shall be submitted as follows: The subdivider shall file with the planning commission four copies of the original plat with all minor revisions shown in red. The plats shall be accompanied by a statement signed by all affected property owners acknowledging their awareness and approval of the revisions. Proposed revisions shall be reviewed by the planning commission. Upon a finding that revisions comply with all applicable regulations, the revised plats shall be submitted to the mayor and council for approval. One copy of the approved plat shall be recorded and one copy shall be attached to the originally recorded plat as part of the public record. 
                  (h)  Fee for review. There shall be a fee charged for the review of a final plat by the planning commission in an amount equal to $50.00 for every lot in the proposed subdivision. 
                  (Ord. of 4-2-84, § 1(8-2203); Ord. of 11-21-94(1), § 9) 
                  Sec. 70-36. - Approval of minor subdivisions. 
                  Minor subdivisions may be submitted as final plats, and shall comply with the requirements of this chapter, including minimum finished floor elevation requirements, with the following exceptions: 
                  (1)  Minor subdivisions shall be processed as major subdivisions if requested by either the planning commission or the mayor and council. 
                  (2)  Topographic information shall not be required unless specifically requested by the city. 
                  (3)  Only one benchmark shall be required. An existing accessible benchmark within 200 feet of the petitioner's property, if shown on the plat, shall satisfy this requirement. 
                  (4)  The developer shall submit a drainage plan for approval if requested by the city. 
                  (5)  Where a series of minor subdivisions are developed or proposed immediately adjacent to one another, the planning commission or mayor and council may require the developer to comply with the procedures for major subdivisions. 
                  (6)  In the case of a minor subdivision which has lots fronting only on an existing, open and public street, and which does not require a new street, the minor subdivision shall only be reviewed and approved by the city administrator, and it shall not be necessary to give notice to the abutting property owners. 
                  (Ord. of 4-2-84, § 1(8-2204); Ord. of 5-7-90(1), § 1; Ord. of 6-4-90) 
                  Sec. 70-37. - Approval of subdivisions not requiring new streets. 
                  In the case of a subdivision which has lots fronting only on an existing, open and public street and which does not require a new street, the developer of such subdivision shall only be required to submit a final plat. 
                  (Ord. of 4-2-84, § 1(8-2301)) 
                  Sec. 70-38. - Variances. 
                  When a peculiar shape or the topography of a tract of land or other unusual condition makes it impractical for a developer to comply with the literal interpretation of the design requirements of this chapter, the mayor and council, following a recommendation of the planning commission, may approve variances to this chapter; provided, however, that in so doing the intent and purpose of this chapter are not violated. 
                  (Ord. of 4-2-84, § 1(8-2302)) 
                  Secs. 70-39—70-60. - Reserved. 
                  ARTICLE III. - DESIGN STANDARDS AND IMPROVEMENTS 

                  Sec. 70-61. - Applicability. 
                  In order that the various purposes of this chapter may be accomplished, all subdivisions hereafter established shall be developed and improved in accordance with the minimum design standards set forth in this article. Those parcels recorded prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived which abut an unopened road or portion thereof shall not be developed until such road or portion thereof has been opened and paved according to city specifications or certified to be paved in accordance with subsection 70-62. Final approval shall not be given a subdivision until all appropriate design standards have been met and until all appropriate required improvements have been installed or an appropriate bond or certified check has been posted to secure the installation of such improvements. 
                  (Ord. of 4-2-84, § 1(8-2100)) 
                  Sec. 70-62. - Streets. 
                  (a)  General standards. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, all streets established in any subdivision shall comply with the following general provisions: 
                  (1)  Continuation of existing street pattern. The arrangement of streets in a subdivision shall provide for the alignment with, the continuation of or the appropriate projection of existing principal streets in surrounding areas. 
                  (2)  Street jogs. Street jogs or centerline offsets in the horizontal alignment of streets across intersections of less than 150 feet shall be prohibited. 
                  (3)  Intersections. The centerlines of no more than two streets shall intersect at any one point. Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles, and no street shall intersect any other street at an angle of less than 60 degrees. Curbed streets shall have a minimum tangent of 100 feet at intersections. 
                  (4)  Streets intersecting with major arterials and secondary arterials. New street entrances on roads designated or classified as arterials shall be not less than 500 feet apart. The mayor and council may reduce the requirement of this subsection whenever they determine that such action will not be contrary to the purpose of this chapter. 
                  (5)  Arterial streets. Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed arterial street, the mayor and council may require marginal access streets, reverse frontage with screen planting contained in a nonaccess reservation along the rear property line, deep lots with rear service lanes, or such other treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential properties and to afford separation of through and local traffic. 
                  (6)  Minimum curb and street radius. The lot line radius at intersecting streets shall be not less than 20 feet. The centerline radius of all curvilinear streets shall be not less than 75 feet. 
                  (7)  Permanent dead-end streets. Dead-end streets, designed to be such permanently, shall be provided at the closed end with a turnaround having an outside roadway diameter of not less than 80 feet and a right-of-way diameter of not less than 100 feet. 
                  (8)  Temporary dead-end streets. Temporary dead-end streets shall be provided with a temporary turnaround area which shall meet the requirements for design, maintenance and removal as approved by the mayor and council. 
                  (9)  Half streets. Half streets shall not be permitted within a subdivision. 
                  (10)  Design of interior streets. Interior streets within subdivisions shall be so laid out and designed that their use by through traffic and speeding traffic will be discouraged. 
                  (11)  Street names. All streets within a subdivision shall be named. No name shall be used which will duplicate or be confused with existing street names. 
                  (12)  Dedication of additional right-of-way. A proposed subdivision that includes a platted street that does not conform to the minimum right-of-way requirements of this chapter shall provide for the dedication of additional right-of-way along either one or both sides of the street so that the minimum right-of-way required by this chapter can be established. If the proposed subdivision abuts only one side of the street, then a minimum of one-half of the required extra right-of-way shall be dedicated by such subdivision. 
                  (13)  Access to adjoining property. Whenever the mayor and council find that street access to adjoining property is needed, a street right-of-way shall be extended to the boundary of such property and such right-of-way shall be dedicated to the public as an unopened street. When such unopened street is required for access to property, then the developer of the property for which access is required shall be responsible for opening and improving the unopened street. 
                  (14)  Street name markers. Street name markers, which shall be constructed to city specifications, shall be installed at all street intersections. 
                  (15)  Conformance with major thoroughfare plan. When the major thoroughfare plan of the community shows proposed arterial streets and collector streets within a proposed subdivision, the subdivider shall design the street system within such subdivision to conform with the location and arrangement of such arterial streets and collector streets. 
                  (16)  Sidewalks. Sidewalks shall be installed on both sides of all major arterials, secondary arterials and collector streets within single-family residential, multifamily residential and commercial subdivisions, and on one side of all marginal access streets within multifamily residential and commercial subdivisions, in accordance with the provisions of subsection (b) of this section. 
                  (b)  Specific standards. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, all streets established in any subdivision shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the following specifications: 

                   
                  (Ord. of 4-2-84, § 1(8-2101)) 
                  Sec. 70-63. - Lots. 
                  All lots which shall hereafter be established within a subdivision shall comply with the following design standards: 
                  (1)  General standards. The following general requirements shall apply to all lots hereafter established within a subdivision: 
                  a.  Street access. Each lot shall abut on a street which shall be dedicated as a public street and which conforms to the design requirements of this chapter; provided that the mayor and council may approve a residential, commercial or industrial lot which does not abut a public street but which is served by a perpetual privately maintained access easement which meets the design and construction standards of this chapter. 
                  b.  Lot lines. Side lot lines shall be as nearly as practical at right angles to straight street lines and radial to curved street lines. 
                  c.  Corner lots. Corner lots for residential use shall be provided with sufficient width and depth to permit the establishment of front yard building setback lines from both streets. 
                  d.  Double frontage lots. Double frontage lots shall only be permitted where it shall be found necessary to separate a development from major arterials or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation. 
                  e.  Minimum lot elevation. No lot shall be approved that does not contain a suitable site of sufficient elevation to permit a finished floor elevation of at least the level of the 100-year flood. The entire lot shall be properly drained. 
                  f.  Residential lots in floodplain. Residential subdivision lots shall be prohibited within floodplain areas where the cost of providing governmental services in the area would pose an unreasonable economic burden. 
                  (2)  Lot width and areas. 
                  a.  Single-family dwelling lots. Lot size requirements are as follows for single-family dwellings including but not limited to: manufactured or mobile homes, stick built homes, modular homes, etc., and individual lots in subdivisions or mobile home lots located in areas other than commercial mobile home parks. Area requirements for multiple dwellings on a single recorded lot, where not prohibited by local zoning, must be provided in multiples of the following minimum lot sizes for each dwelling to be constructed on the recorded lot. See Table MT-1 and subparagraphs 1. through 7. as follows: 

                   
                  1.  The above minimum lot sizes are for the typical size home (three or four bedroom) with basic appurtenances such as: driveway, minimum number of trees, and water supply line. If larger homes, swimming pools, tennis courts or outbuildings, etc., are proposed to be constructed or if trees would interfere with installation of an on-site sewage management system, the Chatham County Board of Health and city will require larger lots to assure usable soil area. 
                  2.  The Chatham County Board of Health and city may also require larger lot sizes when physical factors indicate the need to do so. These factors include, but are not limited to, the availability of sufficient unobstructed land areas for an approved on-site sewage management system and approved replacement system, slope greater than five percent, percolation rates higher than 45 minutes per inch, need for subsurface drainage or adverse topographic features. 
                  3.  For determining compliance with the above-mentioned lot width requirements, all lot widths shall be measured at the minimum building setback line. Single-family dwelling lots served by a public water supply system or non-public water supply system shall also be a minimum width of 100 feet or 150 feet, respectively, within the area where an approved on-site sewage management system and replacement system are to be located. 
                  4.  The following land areas are not considered as a part of a lot when calculating the required minimum lot size: Rights-of-way of roads, easements (such as power line or pipe line) that exclude installation of an on-site sewage management system, soil conditions that exclude the installation of an on-site sewage management system, bodies of water, land within 50 feet of a lake, river, stream, wetland or other bodies of water and similar limiting factors. 
                  5.  There must be an unobstructed area on each lot for installation of an approved on-site sewage management system and an area equal in size for a conventional system or larger area, as appropriate, for an approved replacement system; this will include sufficient area for necessary site modifications for installation of both the initial system and a replacement system. All pertinent city zoning setbacks and other space requirements must also be met. 
                  6.  The maximum daily sewage flow for each lot or parcel of land shall not exceed 600 gpad when served by nonpublic or individual water supply system or 1,200 gpad when served by public water supply system. When sewage flows exceed those quantities (600 or 1,200 gpad as indicated) for a given dwelling structure, the minimum lot size or parcel of land shall be increased proportionally. Example: Assume a public water supply exists (so 1,200 gpad maximum sewage flow allowed per minimum required land area of 21,780 square feet), and there is a proposed sewage flow of 5,000 gpd. To determine X = the square footage of the lot needed, use the following formula: 
                  X =   5,000 gal/day        1,200 gal/acre/day 
                  X = 4.17 acre

                  (b)  On or before the 20th day of the month following each monthly period, a return for the preceding monthly period shall be filed with the clerk showing the gross rent, rent from permanent residents, taxable rent, amount of tax collected or otherwise due for the related period, and such other information as may be required by the clerk. 
                  (c)  Operators collecting the tax shall be allowed a percentage of the tax due and accounted for and shall be reimbursed in the form of a deduction in submitting, reporting and payment of the amount due, if the amount is not delinquent at the time of payment. The rate of the deduction shall be the same rate authorized for deductions from state tax under the Georgia Retailers' and Consumers' Sales and Use Tax Act, approved February 20, 1951, (1951 Ga. Laws, page 360), as amended [O.C.G.A. § 48-8-1 et seq.].

The amount of the payment of the estimated tax liability shall be credited against the amount to be due on the return required under subsection (a) of this section. This subsection shall not apply to any innkeeper unless during the previous fiscal year, the innkeeper's monthly payments exceeded $2,500.00 per month for three consecutive months or more. As used in this subsection, the term "estimated tax liability" means an innkeeper's tax liability under this article, adjusted to account for any subsequent change in the rate of tax imposed under this article or any substantial change in circumstances due to damage to the premises, based on his or her average monthly payments for the last fiscal year. 
                  (e)  Extensions. The city administrator may, for good cause, extend the time for making any returns required under this article for not more than 30 days. No extension granted pursuant to this subsection shall be valid unless granted in writing upon written application, and then the extension shall only be valid for a period, as appropriate, of not more than 12 consecutive months or four consecutive calendar quarters. Upon the grant of any extension authorized by this subsection, the innkeeper shall remit to the city on or before the date the tax would otherwise become due without the grant of the extension an amount which equals not less than 100 percent of the innkeeper's payment for the corresponding period of the preceding tax year. No interest or penalty shall be charged by reason of the granting of an extension pursuant to this subsection during the first ten days of each extension period. Thereafter, interest shall be collected upon the unpaid balance of the innkeeper's liability at the rate of one percent per month.

                  Sec. 74-85. - Deficiency determinations. 
                  (a)  Recomputation of tax. If the clerk is not satisfied with the return of the tax or the amount of the tax required to be paid to the city by any person, he may compute and determine the amount required to be paid upon the basis of any information within his possession or that may come into his possession. One or more deficiency determinations may be made of the amount due for one or more monthly periods. 
                  (b)  Interest on deficiency. The amount of the determination shall bear interest at the rate of one percent per month, or fraction thereof, from the due date of taxes. 
                  (c)  Method of service of notice of determination. The clerk or his designated representative shall give to the operator written notice of his determination. The notice may be served personally or by mail. If served by mail, such service shall be addressed to the operator at his address as it appears in the records of the clerk. Service by mail is complete when delivered by certified mail with a receipt signed by the addressee.

                  Sec. 74-86. - Determination if no return made. 
                  (a)  Estimate of gross receipts. If any person fails to make a return, the clerk shall make an estimate of the amount of the gross receipts of the person, or, as the case may be, of the amount of the total rentals in the city which are subject to the tax. The estimate shall be made for the period in respect to which the person failed to make the return and shall be based upon any information which is in or may come into the possession of the clerk. Written notice shall be given in the manner prescribed in section 74-85(c). 
                  (b)  Interest on amount found due. The amount of the determination shall bear interest at the rate of three-fourths of one percent per month, or fraction thereof, from the 20th day of the month following the monthly period for which the amount or any portion thereof should have been returned, until the date of payment.

For purposes of this subsection, a return or report filed before the last day prescribed by law for the filing thereof shall be considered as filed on such last day. If an extension of time for filing a return or report is granted and the return or report is filed on or before the extended date, the return or report shall be considered as filed on the extended due date. 
                  (c)  Except as otherwise provided by this article, in the case of a false or fraudulent return or report filed with the intent to evade tax or a failure to file a return or report, the amount of any tax imposed by this article shall be assessed at any time. 
                  (d)  Where, before the expiration of the time described in this section for the assessment of any tax imposed by this article, both the city administrator and the person subject to assessment have consented in writing to its assessment after such time, the tax may be assessed at any time prior to the expiration of the agreed upon period. The period so agreed upon may be extended by subsequent agreements in writing made before the expiration of the previously agreed upon period. 
                  (e)  No action without assessment shall be brought for the collection of any tax after the expiration of the period for assessment.

                  If any innkeeper liable for any tax, interest or penalty imposed by this article sells his or her business or quits the business, he or she shall make a final return and payment within fifteen days after the date of selling or quitting the business. The innkeeper's successor or assigns, if any, shall withhold a sufficient amount of the purchase money to cover the amount of the taxes, interest, and penalties due under this article and unpaid until the former owner produces either a receipt from the city showing that the taxes, interest, and penalties due under this article have been paid or a certificate from the city stating that no tax, interest, or penalty is due under this article. If the purchaser of the business fails to withhold the purchase money as required by this section, he or she shall be personally liable for the payment of any taxes, interest, and penalties accruing under this article and unpaid by any former owner or assignor. The personal liability of the purchaser in such a case shall not exceed the amount of the total purchase money, but the property being transferred shall in all cases be subject to the full amount of the tax lien arising from the delinquencies of the former owner. Paid executions may be transferred and enforced as otherwise provided by law.

                  Sec. 74-89. - Credit for tax erroneously collected. 
                  Whenever the amount of any tax or interest has been paid more than once, or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city under this article, it may be offset by the clerk. If the operator or other person determines that he has overpaid or paid more than once, which fact has not been determined by the clerk, he will have three years from the date of payment to file a claim in writing stating the specific grounds upon which the claim is founded. The claim shall be audited. If the claim is approved by the clerk, the excess amount paid the clerk may be credited on any amounts then due and payable from the person by whom it was paid, or his administrators or executors.

                  (a)  The mayor and council may waive the collection of any interest, in whole or in part, due the city on any unpaid taxes whenever or to the extent that they reasonable determine that the delay in payment of the taxes was attributable to the action or inaction of the city. 
                  (b)  The mayor and council may waive, in whole or in part, the collection of any amount due the city as a penalty under this article whenever or to the extent that they reasonably determine that the default giving rise to the penalty was due to reasonable cause and not due to gross or willful neglect or disregard of the law or of regulations or instructions issued pursuant to the law.

                  Sec 74-92. - Penalties added to tax for failure to pay. 
                  (a)  When any innkeeper fails to make any return or to pay the full amount of the tax required by this article, there shall be imposed, in addition to other penalties provided by law, a penalty to be added to the tax in the amount of five percent or five dollars, whichever is greater, if the failure is for not more than 30 days and an additional five percent or $5.00, whichever is greater, for each additional 30 days or fraction of 30 days during which the failure continues. The penalty for any single violation shall not exceed 25 percent or $25.00 in the aggregate, whichever is greater. If the failure is due to providential cause shown to the satisfaction of mayor and council in affidavit form attached to the return and remittance is made within ten days of the due date, the return may be accepted exclusive of penalties and interest. In the case of a false or fraudulent return or a failure to file a return where willful intent exists to defraud the city of any tax due under this article, a penalty of 50 percent of the tax due shall be assessed. 
                  (b)  All civil penalties and interest added to any tax imposed under this article and collected by the city shall be included as revenue derived from such tax for purposes of the expenditure requirements imposed on the city as provided by state law.

                  (a)  The obstruction of a railroad crossing by a train in one of the below-described and forbidden circumstances shall be deemed a nuisance and a hazard and a danger to the health, safety and welfare of the citizens and city of Garden City. The city's police department, or any officer thereof, shall have the right to order those in control of said train to move said train to cease said obstruction. Anyone in control of said train or its cars who fails to move said train and cease said obstruction after being specifically ordered to do so by the police department, or any officer thereof, shall be subject to the general penalties prescribed by section 1-14 for City Code violations. 
                  (b)  It shall be unlawful for any railroad train (engine, car or cars) of any description to obstruct a railroad crossing, or any portion of the width of a crossing, of any public street in the city for any length of time whatsoever unless a brakeman or other employee of such railroad company is at such crossing, or is immediately available, to uncouple the engines or cars so that emergency vehicles of the police and fire departments of the city may proceed across such crossing. 
                  (c)  Further, it shall be unlawful for any railroad train at any time, regardless of whether or not uncoupling personnel are available, to remain stopped as an obstruction of the crossing, or any portion of the width thereof, for a longer period than ten consecutive minutes except that this subsection shall not apply to (1) any train or car in motion other than those engaged in switching, (2) any train car stopped because of any emergency, a natural disaster, or an obstruction of the tracks that is beyond the control of the said train or its parent company, and (3) any train or car stopped to perform a federally required brake system test.

                  The city's water, sewer, public waste disposal, stormwater management, fire protection, and garbage or trash collection service are hereby combined into a single system to serve Garden City. Collectively, the system shall be operated and maintained as a combined public utilities system. The city manager shall direct and control the operation of said combined system, but may operate such system through separate utility divisions, i.e., fire, sewer, stormwater and utility, fire protection, trash pick-up, or in such combination as he deems most efficient. 
                  (Ord. No. 2011-4, § 1, 2-7-11; Ord. No. 2017-1, § 1-7-17)

                  Sec. 82-2. - Utility system accounts; establishment of rates. 
                  The city manager shall keep separate financial books and accounts for each utility system and for the combined utility system. It shall be the duty of the city manager to place into effect with the approval of city council, schedules of rates, fees, and charges for the services, facilities, and commodities furnished by the combined system and, as often as it may appear necessary, to revise and adjust such schedules to the extent necessary to produce funds sufficient to: 
                  (1)  Pay the operating expenses of the combined system; 
                  (2)  Pay the principal and interest when due on any revenue bonds and debt obligations of the water and sewer system, including funding of any debt service reserves or credit reserves required thereby; and, 
                  (3)  Fund any minimum renewal and extension fund requirements as established by a bond ordinance or other proper resolution of the mayor and council; 
                  at least equal to 120 percent of the amount required for the then current fiscal year or accounting period; provided, however, for such systems, a schedule of rates, tolls, fees, and charges for the services, facilities, and commodities furnished by each individual system shall be imposed so as to operate each individual system on a sound business-like basis. For purposes of this section, the system will be deemed to have operated on a sound business-like basis if net revenues of each individual system at least equals 100 percent of that portion of estimated of operating expense, plus debt service, allocable to that system during the current budget period. Such rates, fees, tolls, and charges will be classified in a reasonable manner to cover users of the services and facilities furnished by the combined system so that, as nearly as practicable, such rates, fees, tolls, and charges shall be uniform in application to all users falling within any reasonable class. No free service will at any time be furnished, including to any political subdivision or any public body. No customer will be connected to the combined system or any individual utility thereof without first having executed a service agreement in the form provided by the city manager, and paid the applicable connection fees and charges. Where applicable, a proper meter shall first be installed for services or commodities as delivered. To the extent authorized by law, it shall be the duty of the city manager to require the owners of all improved property accessible to services of the combined system to connect thereto.

                  Sec. 82-3. - Audit of combined system. 
                  As soon as practicable after the closing of each fiscal year, an audit will be made of all books and accounts pertaining to the combined system and each individual utility by an independent certified public accountant or firm of suitable experience and responsibility. Copies of such audits shall be made available to city council and to interested persons as a public record of the city.

                  Sec. 82-5. - Right to shut off utilities for repair; emergencies. 
                  The city manager shall have the right to shut-off utilities for necessary repairs and work upon the system; provided, however, shut offs shall be planned to the extent possible and reasonable notice given to users by the best available means; in any emergency situation, notice of a shut-off is not required. The city will exercise its best efforts to restore normal levels of service as soon as feasible, considering the nature of the situation and all circumstances. The city shall not be responsible for damages or rebate of fees, rates, tolls, and charges for temporary outages or shut-offs, or for compensatory damages allegedly arising from loss of utility services.

                  Sec. 82-6. - Termination of services due to nonpayment or other cause. 
                  (a)  In the absence of a written agreement with the City creating a property interest or legitimate expectation of continued services, all utility services except for fire protection service may be terminated due to violation of published rules, regulations and procedures governing service delivery and billing practices of the combined system as promulgated by the city manager. If amounts owed for water, sewer, fire protection, stormwater management, solid waste disposal, and garbage pick-up service are not timely paid, all such services except for fire protection services shall be disconnected. Payment of amounts owed for each utility is a condition of service as to the remaining utilities except for fire protection service. Where customers are subject to termination of services due to non-payment, it shall be the policy of the city to afford the customer reasonable opportunity for a meeting with a responsible employee of the Combined System's Customer Service Division to resolve any dispute prior to the scheduled date of termination. Where notice cannot be given the customer, as shown on the Combined System's billing records, or known users at the location where service is provided, after reasonable diligence by the city staff, the city shall retain the right to terminate service upon concluding the amount billed was justly due. Failure by customer to receive a bill for the current period shall not constitute a defense for non-payment when services are shown to have been accepted at the service address. Payment of fees for each utility is a condition of services as to the remaining utilities except for fire protection service.

                  Sec. 82-7. - Deposit required; receipt; disposition of funds. 
                  The person in whose name the utility service is ordered must post a deposit prior to the installation of utility service by the city. The deposit shall be two and one-half times the monthly bill for all services, as estimated by the city manager using whatever data may be available. Deposits may be waived if evidence is produced that the customer has a good record of payment or that the customer would reasonably be expected to pay all bills promptly. If utility bills are paid on time for a period of four years, the deposit shall be refunded by the city. In the event that a deposit is waived or is less than two and one-half times the monthly bill for all services for whatever reason, and the customer is delinquent in payment of one or more bills, the deposit for that customer's account or accounts may be required to be increased to two and one-half times the monthly bill for all services. Such increased deposit may be required to paid in full before reconnection of service.

                  All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes to which reference is made in this article shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association, and shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples taken at the control manhole. If no special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb and property. The particular analyses involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are obtained from 24-hour composites of all outfalls, whereas pH's are determined from periodic grab samples.

                  For the purposes of interpreting the provisions of this article V, a residential equivalent unit is defined as that portion of a user's facility that has an impact on the water and wastewater system equivalent to a single-family residence. The determination of a facility's residential equivalent unit shall be based on estimated water consumption as shown in guidelines established by the city administrator, and approved, from time to time, by city council, or on square footage. Peak water consumption of 300 gallons per day or a floor space of 3,000 square feet, shall be the equivalent of one residential unit. The method which results in the greater number of equivalent residential units shall be applied. The standards in the above-mentioned guidelines shall be used in the determination of water consumption. If the guidelines do not provide information for a particular application, the estimated water consumption shall be calculated by the city administrator in accordance with sound engineering practices used and information available from the Georgia EPD, U.S. EPA, or standard reference materials, commonly used for estimating flows.

                  Water and waste water tap-in fees shall be charged on the basis of residential units or equivalent residential units according to a fee schedule established by the city administrator and approved, from time to time, by city council. The tap fee for water service shall include the charge for connecting the utility force main with the service lateral. The consumer/owner shall also pay an installation fee for the labor and materials necessary to install the water meter measuring the water flow to the premises served (including the meter itself, backflow preventer, and meter box), and the service lateral running from the tap juncture to the water meter. Any connections from the meter to the premises being furnished utilities shall be under the supervision and inspection of the director of the city's water and sewer department. If the consumer/owner uses an independent qualified plumber instead of city labor to install the water and sewer connections, a reduced installation fee will be charged to cover the cost of the water meter and associated parts, and the cost of the city's inspection of the plumber's work.

                  Sec. 82-176. - Water meters. 
                  (a)  Installation of water meters, in general. Water meters shall be installed on the premises or properties occupied by all the users of water furnished by the city at a location established by building inspector. 
                  (b)  Number of meters to be installed. 
                  (1)  A separate meter shall be installed for each single-family residence in the city. 
                  (2)  In all multiunit residential dwellings or apartment buildings containing four or less residential units, or trailer parks containing four or less manufactured homes, there shall be a separate meter installed for each dwelling unit and for all accessory improvements of the owner using water. 
                  (3)  With respect to all multiunit residential dwellings or apartment buildings containing four or more residential units, or trailer parks containing four or more manufactured homes built after January 1, 2008, there shall be a separate meter installed for each dwelling unit and for all accessory improvements of the owner using water, with a master meter located at the connection point between the city's water main and the major service lateral servicing the underlying property for the purpose of measuring the total flow of water being furnished to the entire property. 
                  (4)  With respect to all multiunit residential dwellings or apartment buildings containing four or more residential units, or trailer parks containing four or more manufactured homes built prior to January 1, 2008, there shall either be (A) a single water meter for the entire property if already existing as of January 1, 2008, or (B) a separate meter for each building or dwelling unit and for all accessory improvements of the owner using water, with a master meter located at the connection point between the city's water main and the major service lateral servicing the underlying property for the purpose of measuring the total flow of water being furnished to the entire property. 
                  (5)  Whether any commercial development (excluding apartment complexes) is on a single water meter, or multiple meters shall be determined by the city administrator based on its physical make-up including, but not limited to, the size, number, and location of its buildings and units. If individual meters are required for each commercial unit, a master meter measuring the total water flow to the commercial parcel may also be required by the city administrator if he, in his sole discretion, deems one necessary. 
                  (c)  Extent of maintaining and repairing meters and service lines. 
                  (1)  The cost of the maintenance of city-supplied water meters, including meter connections, shall be borne by the city. 
                  (2)  The service line(s) running from the water main to the property owner's meter(s) shall be maintained by either (A) the city at the property owner's cost (except that repairs will be made at the expense of the city when the damage being repaired is due to negligence on the part of the city or (B) the property owner with the understanding that such maintenance and repair work shall be performed at the property owner's cost and under the supervision and inspection of the city's water and sewer director from whom the property owner shall get pre-approval for any repair and maintenance work and with the additional understanding that all repairs to such line(s) be repaired within 24 hours of being notified of the need therefor. Any property owner opting to perform such maintenance and repair work itself must submit a written request to do so to the city administrator who shall grant same based on his discretion reasonably exercised. If the property owner defaults upon its assumed responsibility of performing such maintenance and repair work on the service line(s), and such default continues after being given reasonable notice to cure same, the city may perform the necessary work and be reimbursed by the property owner for the cost of same. If the city is not paid for any maintenance and repair work which it performs pursuant to this subsection 82-176(c)(2), it may cut off the supply of water, and water will not be turned on again, until the charges are paid to the city. 
                  (3)  The property owner shall maintain the service lines running from the meters to the premises served. The city may, in case of emergency, repair any service line running from any meter to the premises served and, if this is done, the cost of such repair work shall be repaid to the city by the owner of the premises. 
                  (d)  Adjustment to charges. The city manager or designee shall be authorized to make equitable adjustments in billings for wastewater services only in cases where leaks and pipes and plumbing facilities result in increased billings without fault on the part of the customer. The billing adjustment policy is allowed to promote water conservation programs of the city and to provide a financial incentive for customers to maintain private water service lines and building plumbing fixtures. Such adjustments shall be made based on an average of prior billings only after repairs have been made as certified by a licensed plumber or other acceptable information that documents the water line repair. Utility billing adjustments will be allowed and determined as follows: 
                  (1)  Utility billing adjustments are allowed for residential and non-residential water/sewer customer categories; however, the customer must have sewer service. 
                  (2)  Utility billing adjustments are only available to sewer customers and will be determined based on the sewer portion of the water/sewer bill (adjustments not being allowed for water-only customers in that the entire cost of delivery of water service has been completed when water passes the utility meter). 
                  (3)  Customers will be allowed to apply for one utility billing adjustment per year. 
                  (4)  Utility billing adjustments are determined using the 12-month history of metered water consumption/sewer usage for the period preceding the high-consumption month when the water leak is repaired. In the event that a customer has less than a 12-month usage history, the average consumption will be determined by the city on a case by case basis. 
                  (5)  When a billing adjustment is allowed, it will be determined using the current utility billing rate schedule and based on one-half of the high consumption month sewer bill above the average sewer consumption be allowed as a credit. 
                  The following provides an example of how an adjustment should be determined: 

                   
                  (e)  Procedure when meter is inaccessible. If a meter reader is unable to procure a reading of a meter after two calls due to the occupant not permitting entrance, or entrance to the premises is made precarious by a vicious dog or otherwise, or ingress to the meter is obstructed in any way whatsoever, the water may be shutoff by the city and an estimated charge made for the amount of water consumed. In case the water is shutoff for any of such reasons, it will not be turned on again until free access to the meter is provided and payment of arrearage is made. 
                  (f)  Control; interference unlawful. All meters shall remain under the direct control of the city and it shall be unlawful for persons other than those authorized by the city to connect, disconnect, or tamper with any such meter. 
                  (g)  Water and sewage fees for industrial establishments. In cases where the character of the sewage from any manufacturer or industrial plant, building, or premises is such that it imposes an unreasonable burden upon the city sewage disposal system, a charge in addition to that already imposed by the city upon such business may be made therefor, and/or the council may, as it deems it advisable, compel such manufacturing or industrial plant, building, or premises to treat such sewage in such manner as shall be specified by council before discharging such sewage in any sewer lines owned or maintained by the city. Factors considered in setting the additional sewer charge shall include, but not be limited to, the constituents and characteristics of the plant's wastewater, the quantity of water consumed by the establishment, the number and size of sewer connections, and the necessity for the city to establish monitoring programs. No such additional charge shall be fixed until after a public hearing at which the owners, tenants, or occupants of the property served or to be served by the sewage disposal system and all others interested shall have an opportunity to be heard concerning the proposed additional charge. 
                  (h)  Filling of swimming pools. Whenever a swimming pool is filled with water, the property owner, tenant, or other person owning the pool shall apply to the city administrator for an adjustment of his/her utility bill to account for the lack of sewer service incidental thereto.

                  Sec. 82-180. - Multiple users. 
                  (a)  Served by single line. The owner of the premises and real property shall be liable for the payment of all charges for water and sewer service to the premises in all cases where there is more than one user on one water system line without a separate stopcock installed for each user. In such cases, the owner shall be required to file an application in accordance with section 82-28 and the owner shall be responsible for the charges in accordance with section 82-178. In all such cases where there is more than one user on a line served by one stopcock, a deposit will not be accepted from any of the occupants, tenants or users who may be served by the same water line. 
                  (b)  Served by multiple lines. The owner of a multiunit property shall not be billed for units whose occupants have applied for water service and receive it through individual meters. Such owner shall also not be billed for occupants who have not paid water bills and for vacated separately metered units. The owner shall pay, however, for water which is being supplied to its accessory improvements, if any, through an individual meter, and for water which is being supplied to its property but not flowing through any individual meter located thereon, which amount being computed by subtracting the total amount of water running through the individual meters from the amount of water running through the master meter located on the property as required by Code section 82-176.

                  (a)  Uncontrolled stormwater drainage/discharge may have a significant, adverse impact on health, safety, and welfare of the city and the quality of life of its citizens. More specifically, surface water runoff can carry pollutants and nutrients into receiving waters. 
                  (b)  Uncontrolled stormwater drainage can increase the incidence of flooding and the level of floods which occur, endangering roads, other public and private property, and human life. 
                  (c)  Altered land surfaces can change the rate and volume of runoff. 
                  (d)  Adverse water quality and quantity consequences described above could result in substantial economic losses. Potential losses include, but are not limited to, increased water treatment costs, as well as state and federal fines associated with water quality violations. 
                  (e)  Many future problems can be avoided through proper stormwater management. 
                  (f)  Every parcel of real property, both public and private, either uses or benefits from the maintenance of the municipal separate storm sewer system. 
                  (g)  Current and anticipated growth will contribute to and increase the need for improvement and maintenance of the municipal separate storm sewer system.

                  (Ord. No. 2017-4, § 1, 5-15-17) 
                  Sec. 84-2. - Purposes. 
                  This chapter has been enacted based upon a recognized need for revitalization in geographic areas within the city that are suffering or may suffer from disinvestment, underdevelopment, and economic decline and is intended to provide encouragement and incentives to private businesses to reinvest, renovate, restore, improve and rehabilitate such areas for new housing construction and the economic viability and profitability of businesses and commerce and to generate increased employment opportunities for residents of such areas. 
                  (Ord. No. 2017-4, § 1, 5-15-17) 
                  Sec. 84-3. - Qualifying business or service enterprise. 
                  A qualifying business or service enterprise is an enterprise which caused employment to increase by five or more new full-time job equivalents in a designated enterprise zone and which provides additional economic stimulus in such zone. Additionally, the business or service enterprise must engage in new construction; make additions to existing structures; engage in substantial renovation of existing structures; make a significant investment in equipment replacement or expansion; or otherwise alter the physical premises in which the business or service enterprise operates in a manner which adds substantial value to the structures. Cosmetic changes or remodeling to the appearance of a structure which does not increase the assessed valuation of the property by more than 25 percent does not meet the construction or renovations standards of this section. The quality and quantity of such additional economic stimulus shall be determined, on a case-by-case basis, by the city council. In making such determination, the mayor and council may rely upon information provided by the applicant, staff reports, economic studies, or other information determined by the mayor and council to provide a reliable indicator or economic stimulus. The burden shall be on the applicant to establish that the applicant meets the criteria set out in this section. Such business or service enterprise may be new, an expansion or reinvestment of an existing business or service enterprise, or a successor to such business or service enterprise. Whenever possible, ten percent of such new employees shall be low-income or moderate-income individuals, as defined under the Act. 
                  (Ord. No. 2017-4, § 1, 5-15-17) 
                  Sec. 84-4. - Designation of enterprise zones. 
                  City council may designate one or more geographic areas as enterprise zones following an analysis of criteria (i.e., pervasive poverty, unemployment, general distress, underdevelopment, general blight) and data described in the Act. Any areas designated as an enterprise zone may be redesignated as an enterprise zone after the expiration of its initial term if the area continues to meet the criteria for an enterprise zone. 
                  (Ord. No. 2017-4, § 1, 5-15-17) 
                  Sec. 85-5. - Tax exemption; other incentives. 
                  (a)  Qualifying business and service enterprises in a designated enterprise zone shall be granted an exemption from municipal ad valorem taxes, excluding property taxes imposed by Chatham County and school districts or property taxes imposed for general obligation debt that would otherwise be levied on the qualifying business and service enterprise not to exceed the following schedule: 
                  (1)  One hundred percent of the property taxes shall be exempt for the first five years; 
                  (2)  Eighty percent of the property taxes shall be exempt for the next two years; 
                  (3)  Sixty percent of the property taxes shall be exempt for the next year; 
                  (4)  Forty percent of the property taxes shall be exempt for the next year; and 
                  (5)  Twenty percent of the property taxes shall be exempt for the last year. 
                  (b)  If a project consists of new residential construction, residential rehabilitation, or other rehabilitation of an existing structure and the value of the improvement exceeds the value of the land by ratio of five to one, then the exemptions set forth in this section shall apply whether or not the project is carried out by a qualifying business of service enterprise. The tax exemptions pursuant to this paragraph shall commence on the first day of the year following designation of the project as a qualifying project under this paragraph. 
                  (c)  In no event shall the value of the property tax exemptions granted to qualifying business and service enterprises within an enterprise zone created by the city exceed ten percent of the value of the property tax digest of the city. 
                  (d)  For any qualifying business or service enterprise, the tax exemption described in this section shall be effective upon approval by the mayor and council of the business or service enterprise as qualifying. The effective date of the tax abatement shall begin on January 1 of the year following the effective date of approval and such tax exemption shall continue for the predetermined period even if the enterprise zone designation has terminated. A minimum of five new jobs must be maintained throughout the exemption period for a qualifying business or service enterprise to maintain eligibility for the tax exemption. Property tax exemptions granted to business or service enterprises that continue to qualify for the exemption shall continue for the full term of the incentives. 
                  (e)  Other incentives may be granted and will be determined on a case-by-case basis as approved by the city council and may include exemption from any or all of the following: 
                  (1)  Water/Sewer fees; or 
                  (2)  Occupation taxes, license fees, or other local fees and taxes; or 
                  (3)  Other local fees or taxes as authorized by the mayor and council. 
                  (f)  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, the city may enter into agreements with qualifying business or service enterprises in designated enterprise zones to provide for modification or termination of any tax and fee exemptions and abatements.

Except as otherwise provided, property tax incentives granted to a qualified business or service enterprise shall remain in effect for the full term of the exemption period.

                  Street means a public or private roadway, open to general public use and having a pavement or roadbed width of not less than 26 feet, which affords the principal means of access to abutting property. Streets are divided into five classes: major arterial, secondary arterial, collector, minor and marginal access, and private street. These classes are defined below. GDOT equivalent classifications are provided in parenthesis where appropriate. 
                  (1)  Major arterial (urban principal arterial) means a street or highway that serves urbanized areas and provides the highest level of service at the greatest speed for the longest uninterrupted distance, generally with some degree of access control. 
                  (2)  Secondary arterial (urban minor arterial) means any arterial facility not classified as a major arterial that places greater emphasis on land access than major arterials and offers a lower level of traffic mobility. A secondary arterial interconnects with, and augments, the major arterial system. It provides service to trips of moderate length at a somewhat lower level of travel mobility and distributes travel to smaller areas than those of major arterials. Secondary arterials may carry local bus routes and provide intra-community continuity, but ideally they should not penetrate identifiable neighborhoods. 
                  (3)  Collector (collector street) means a street that provides both land access service and traffic circulation within residential neighborhoods, commercial or industrial areas. It differs from the arterial system in that facilities on a collector system may penetrate residential neighborhoods or commercial developments, distributing trips from the arterials through the area to the ultimate destination. The collector street also collects traffic from local streets in residential neighborhoods and channels it into the arterial system. 
                  (4)  Minor and marginal access (local street) means a street that provides direct access to abutting land and access to higher systems. It offers the lowest level of mobility and usually contains no bus routes. Service to through traffic movement in this system is usually deliberately discouraged. 
                  (5)  Private street means any street or road which is platted, but not reserved or dedicated to or accepted by the city, and whose use is restricted by notice of sign or by a gate, barrier or other device intended to exclude the general public, or which is identified as private on a recorded subdivision plat. It typically does not provide through access and is not maintained by any government agency. 
                  The city's public rights-of-way have been assigned the following street classifications: 

                   
                  Street, opened. A street or road shall be deemed to be opened if it either: 
                  (1)  Was available for public use prior to the adoption of the ordinance from which this section derives; or 
                  (2)  Was constructed to city specifications following the adoption of the ordinance from which this section derives. 
                  Street, unopened. A street or road or any part thereof shall be deemed to be unopened if it is not cleared, graded and available for public use. 
                  Structure means anything constructed or erected, the use of which requires more or less permanent location on the ground, or which is attached to something having a location on the ground. 
                  Temporary labor employment center means a building used to assemble persons applying for temporary day labor work. 
                  Trailer means a vehicle with or without its own motive power, which is mounted on wheels or is designed to be so mounted and transported. 
                  Trailer, camper means a trailer designed or used specifically as a recreation unit and not used as a permanent residence, with an overall length not exceeding 30 feet. 
                  Truck stop means a combination of uses housed under a single structure and designed as a service center to accommodate the needs of truckers. Such uses may include gas pumps, service areas, restaurants, minor vehicle repair, overnight motels and other uses related to truckers. 
                  Truck terminal means a facility used for the purposes of truck assembly or dispatching, which may also include the loading and off-loading of trucks and the storage or handling of goods and materials and major repair and service of trucks. 
                  Use, accessory means: 
                  (1)  A temporary use of a building established in connection with a construction project or real estate development, excluding facilities for sleeping or cooking. 
                  (2)  A use of a building customarily incidental and subordinate to the principal use of building on a lot and located on the same lot with such principal use or building. 
                  Use, principal means the principal purpose for which a lot or the main building thereon is designed, arranged or intended, and for which it is or may be used, occupied or maintained in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. 
                  Yard means an open space on a lot situated between the principal building on such lot and the lot line of such lot or situated between the principal building on such lot and the centerline of an abutting street right-of-way. In measuring a yard for determining the width of a side yard, the depth of a front yard or the depth of a rear yard, the minimum horizontal distance between the lot line or the street right-of-way centerline and the principal building on the lot shall be used. 
                  Yard, front means a yard extending across the front of a lot from side lot line to side lot line and lying between the centerline of the abutting street right-of-way and the principal building on the lot.

                  Sec. 90-41. - Districts established. 
                  For the purpose of this chapter, the city is divided into 12 zoning districts designated as follows: 

                   
                  (Code 1976, § 8-3004; Ord. of 3-19-84(1), § 1; Ord. of 4-3-06, § 1; Ord. of 5-19-08, § 1) 
                  Sec. 90-42. - Purpose of districts. 
                  The purposes of the zoning districts are as follows: 
                  (1)  R-A, agriculture (residential agriculture). The purpose of the R-A district is to protect those rural areas within the urban expansion areas for future urban development. This district is also established to protect against the blight and depreciation which can result from premature development and to encourage future development in a coordinated and orderly manner. 
                  (2)  R-1, residential. The purpose of the R-1 district is to create a district in which one-family dwellings and certain nondwelling uses are permitted. 
                  (3)  R-2, residential. The purpose of the R-2 district is to create a district in which one-family dwellings, two-family dwellings, multifamily dwellings and certain nondwelling uses are permitted. 
                  (4)  R-I-N, institutional. The purpose of the R-I-N district is to create an area in which residential, institutional and professional uses can be intermixed while at the same time achieving a healthful living environment. 
                  (5)  C-1, commercial. The purpose of the C-1 district is to provide and encourage the proper grouping of roadside service areas that will accommodate needs of the traveling public in a manner that will prevent traffic congestion, traffic hazards and blight on the streets and highways within the city. 
                  (6)  C-2, commercial. The purpose of the C-2 district is to create and protect areas in which heavy commercial and certain industrial-like activities are permitted. 
                  (7)  C-2A, commercial. The purpose of the C-2A district is to create and protect areas in which heavy commercial and certain industrial-like activities are permitted, including any activities related to the sale or consumption of alcoholic beverages. 
                  (8)  I-1, industrial. The purpose of the I-1 district is to create and protect areas for those industrial uses which do not create excessive noise, odors, smoke and dust, and which do not possess other objectionable characteristics which might be detrimental to the surrounding neighborhoods or to the other uses permitted in this district. 
                  (9)  I-2, industrial. The purpose of the I-2 district is to create and protect areas in which industries which are not permitted in an I-1 district can be permitted. 
                  (10)  P, planned development district. The purpose of the P district is to create areas that will have to be developed under a general development plan approved by the city planning commission and which will be an overlay district in addition to the standard zoning classification district for the area. 
                  (11)  C-2A(B and W), Commercial. The purpose of the C-2A(B and W) District is to create and protect areas in which heavy commercial and certain industrial-like activities are permitted, as well as to provide an area for the sale or consumption of alcoholic beverages limited to malt beverages and wine. 
                  (12)  Mixed-Use Districts. 
                  (a)  Intent and purpose. The purpose of the mixed-use district is to encourage a balance and compatible mix of retail, professional, residential, civic, entertainment, and cultural uses, while promoting a coherent architectural identity. 
                  (Code 1976, § 8-3004; Ord. of 3-19-84(1), § 1; Ord. of 4-3-06, § 2; Ord. of 5-19-08, § 2) 
                  Sec. 90-43. - Designation of P districts. 
                  (a)  Before an area shall be designated as a P district on the zoning map for the city, a general development plan shall be submitted to and approved by the city planning commission. The planning commission may disapprove, approve or modify the plan in order to secure an orderly development pattern in accordance with the purposes of this chapter. 
                  (b)  The planning commission may, on its own motion, recommend approval of a P district. If such recommendation is approved, the developer shall be required to submit a general development plan to the planning commission for approval prior to development of the site. 
                  (c)  The general plan for a proposed P district shall include proposed uses and overall development standards and shall indicate the proposed use or reuse of all land, open spaces, location of major streets, recreation areas, school sites, religious centers and such other plan elements and reasonable design criteria as may be deemed necessary by the planning commission in a preapplication conference to accomplish the purposes of this chapter. Such plan shall promote an environment of stable and desirable character in harmony with the established or proposed land use pattern in surrounding areas. 
                  (d)  Following approval of the generalized development plan by the planning commission, no development shall take place until detailed development plans or subdivision plats, where required, shall have been submitted to the planning commission staff for review and are approved. 
                  (e)  If property within a P planning zone is to be developed in phases, such detailed development plans may be submitted in phases. 
                  (f)  Specific development plans shall indicate in detail the layout of proposed streets and curb cuts, parking areas, amenities such as open spaces, landscaping, pedestrian and bicycle trails, major drainageways, school locations, church locations, locations of public facilities, building arrangements, commercial areas, lotting arrangements and other significant details as may be reasonably required by the planning commission. 
                  (g)  Specific development plans approved by the planning commission shall be certified to the building official for the issuance of applicable permits. No development shall take place within a P district that is not shown on a specific development plan as certified by the planning commission. 
                  (h)  Development standards shall be applied as provided elsewhere in this chapter for the particular district; provided that the planning commission may approve variances from these requirements at the request of the developer on a finding that such variances: 
                  (1)  Would be in keeping with the overall character of the area. 
                  (2)  Would not be contrary to the purpose and intent of this chapter. 
                  (3)  Would not be detrimental to existing or proposed surrounding uses. 
                  (4)  Would serve public purposes to a degree equal to or greater than the standards replaced. 
                  (i)  When an area is rezoned to a planning district classification, the letter "P" shall be placed in front of the standard zoning classification identification for the area in question.

                  Sec. 90-44. - Official zoning map. 
                  The location and boundaries of the zoning districts within the city shall be set forth on a map entitled "Official City Zoning Map of Garden City," dated August 6, 1984, and as such map may be amended subsequent to the adoption thereof. Such map is made a part of this chapter to the same extent as if the information set forth on such map were fully described and incorporated in this section. The official city zoning map shall be on file in the office of the clerk, located in the city hall.

                  (1)  Unless otherwise specifically indicated, where district boundaries are indicated on the zoning map as approximately following the centerline of a street, highway, railroad, right-of-way line, stream bed or riverbed, or such centerline extended, then such centerlines shall be construed to be such boundaries. 
                  (2)  Where district boundary lines are indicated on the zoning map as approximately following the corporate limits line of the city, then such corporate limits line shall be construed to be such district boundaries. 
                  (3)  Where district boundaries are indicated on the zoning map as approximately following lot lines or such lot lines extended, then such lot lines or such lot lines extended shall be construed to be such district boundaries. 
                  (4)  Where a district boundary divides a lot, the requirements for the district in which the greater portion of the lot lies shall be extended to the balance of the lot; provided, however, that such extension shall not include any part of such lot which lies more than 50 feet beyond the district boundary, and provided, further, that this provision shall not apply to a through lot. In the case of a through lot, the restrictions of the district applying to adjoining lots which front on the same street as the lot frontage in question shall apply.

                  (b)  Permit required. No fence or wall exceeding three feet in height shall be erected without first obtaining a fence permit. The building official shall issue the fence permit if he finds that the proposed fence complies with all of the requirements of this section. A brick wall used as a fence shall be constructed in compliance with the building code. 
                  (c)  Residential districts. Fences and walls located in residential districts shall be subject to the following restrictions: 
                  (1)  Fences shall not be permitted in front yards or areas extending from any street right-of-way line to the existing building line of the main primary residence.

                  (3)  Wire fences and nondecorative metal fences (e.g. fences constructed of roofing tin) are prohibited. Chain link fence as well as fences made of wood and masonry materials are acceptable. 
                  (4)  If a wooden fence has only one finished face, the finished side shall face the exterior property line. 
                  (5)  All swimming pools shall be completely enclosed by a fence at least four feet in height or a screen enclosure. Openings in the fence shall not permit the passage of a six-inch diameter sphere. The fence or screen enclosure shall be equipped with self-closing and self-latching gates. Walls and fences erected for the specific purpose of providing security for accessory recreational uses, such as swimming pools and tennis courts, may be ten feet in height, provided such fence shall be set back at least one foot from the property line for each foot it exceeds six feet in height, and provided such accessory recreational use is located within a rear yard. All of the provisions pertaining to fences, including design and location, shall apply. 
                  (d)  Commercial and industrial districts. Fences and walls located in any commercial or industrial district shall be subject to the following restrictions: 
                  (1)  No fence or wall shall be erected, placed, or otherwise installed on any lot nearer to any street than the minimum building front setback line. 
                  (2)  On corner lots, no fence or wall shall be erected, placed, or otherwise installed nearer to the street than the minimum front setback line on both streets. 
                  (3)  If a fence is constructed of metal, the metal shall be of a decorative type and shall not be constructed with roofing tin. Barbed wire or razor wire may be used for security purposes in business and industrial districts along the top of a fence if such fence is six feet or greater in height, and/or for agricultural uses. 
                  (4)  Walls and fences erected in commercial districts shall not exceed eight feet in height and in industrial districts shall not exceed ten feet in height, subject to the following: 
                  a.  Walls and fences adjacent to a residential zoning district or to a permitted residential use shall not exceed eight feet in height along rear and side yards or six feet in height in front yards. If such fences are constructed of wood, the fence surfaces shall be painted or stained. If such fences are constructed of concrete block, the block shall be painted or stuccoed. 
                  b.  Walls and fences shall be set back at least five feet from the property line when abutting a residential district or a permitted residential use. The setback area shall be maintained as a landscaped area. 
                  c.  Walls and fences erected in commercial or industrial districts for enclosure, retaining, or concealment purposes (as opposed to decorative purposes) shall be solid or visually opaque and constructed so as to prevent the passage of debris or light, and constructed of materials which are of a uniform shape, color, and design. 
                  d.  Walls and fences erected in commercial districts for enclosure, retaining, or concealment purposes shall be constructed of either brick, stone, architectural tile, masonry units, slatted wood, or other similar material (not including chain link or other fence wire except as permitted by section 90-96(d)(3)). Walls and fences erected in industrial districts for enclosure, retaining, or concealment purposes shall be constructed of all fencing materials permitted in commercial districts, as well as chain link or other fence wire (excluding barb and razor wire, the use of which is limited by section 90-96(d)(3)), and sheet metal which may be used when the fence is not abutting or adjacent to a residential zoning district or a permitted residential use, and is not located in a front yard. Any wall or fence in existence as of April 19, 1999, shall be exempt from the provisions of this subparagraph (4)d. which were adopted on said date, until such time that it needs to be replaced in its substantial entirety. 
                  (e)  Variances. The board of appeals shall be authorized to grant general variances to the requirements of this section. 
                  (f)  Temporary walls and fences. This section shall not prohibit the erection of temporary fences for construction sites or similar activities where approved by the city administrator for a specified period of less than 18 months.

                  Sec. 90-100. - Substandard lots of record. 
                  Any lot of record existing at the time of adoption of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived which has an area or width that is less than that required by this chapter shall be subject to the following exceptions and modifications: 
                  (1)  Adjoining lots. When two or more adjoining lots with continuous frontage are in one ownership at any time after the adoption of this chapter, and such lots individually are less than 6,000 square feet in area or are less than 60 feet in width, then such adjoining lots in one ownership shall be combined into one or more lots of record each having an area and width as required by this chapter for the zoning district in which such lots are located. 
                  (2)  Single lot not meeting minimum lot size requirements. Except as set forth in subsection (1) of this section, in any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, any lot of record existing at the time of the adoption of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived which has an area or a width which is less than that required by this chapter may be used as a building site for a one-family dwelling, provided that, if such lot is not served by public water and public sewer, then the application for a permit to construct a dwelling on the lot shall be approved by the county health department. 
                  (3)  Substandard lots created by government acquisition. Except as set forth in subsection (1) of this section, in any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, any lot or tract of land which is created through a taking by a governmental body, either by condemnation or acquisition, which has an area or a width which is less than that required by this chapter, may be used as a building site for a one-family dwelling, provided that, if such lot is not served by public water and public sewer, then the application for a permit to construct a dwelling on the lot shall be approved by the county health department.

                  When a lot permitted by this chapter has a lot width of 40 feet or less, then the building official shall be authorized to reduce the side yard requirements for such a lot of record, provided, however, that there shall be not less than eight feet between buildings. 
                  (Code 1976, § 8-3014(f)) 
                  Sec. 90-102. - Group development projects. 
                  Group development projects consisting of two or more principal buildings devoted to common or similar use(s) may be constructed on a single lot when such uses or buildings are permitted in the underlying zoning district; provided that such buildings and uses shall be approved by the board of appeals. In all cases, group development projects shall comply with the following standards: 
                  (1)  Design standards generally. Review and approval of group development projects shall be in accordance with the requirements and development standards for Code section 90-48 entitled "Development Plans for Group Development Projects, Sites Contiguous to Property with More Restrictive Zoning Classifications or Properties Abutting/Fronting onto Arterial or Collective Streets" (requiring site plan approval by the planning commission). 
                  (2)  Street access. Any building established as part of a group development project which cannot properly be served by emergency or service vehicles (garbage trucks, postal service, delivery trucks, handicapped vehicles, etc.) from an abutting street shall be made accessible to such vehicles by a paved driveway having a roadbed width of not less than 20 feet, exclusive of parking spaces, and having sufficient paved maneuvering area at the end of such roadbed to allow for the safe turn around of such vehicles. 
                  (3)  Location . No dwelling structure established as part of a residential group development project shall be situated on a lot so as to face the rear of another dwelling structure within the development or an adjoining property. 
                  (4)  Lot size. Group developments shall comply with the lot area design standards for the zoning district within which they are located; however, drives, parking spaces, and other non-enclosed car areas such as street rights-of-way and vehicle storage areas shall not be included in the land area when determining land area calculations to determine a site's allowed density. 
                  (5)  Orientation on lot. The orientation and location of the structures in a group development shall be such that their placement would allow for the future subdivision of the lot under the provision of the subdivision requirements at a later date, if at all possible. All building setbacks, height restrictions, lot coverage standards, open space, landscaping, buffers, parking and loading space requirements, and other development standards of the subject zoning district within which the parcel is located shall be complied with unless a variance is otherwise granted in accordance with the provisions of this Code. 
                  (6)  Unity of development guidelines. Unity of development guidelines shall be submitted for any retail area with more than one principal building, unit-ownership (condominium) development, a shopping center and shopping area, office center, and any non-retail use included in such development. The guidelines shall describe the physical characteristics of the development in terms of the following primary unifying elements: building materials, color(s), and architectural features. At least two of these elements must be present in each building of the development, including associated out parcels. 
                  a.  Building. If selected, the dominant material or combination of materials shall be specified within the guidelines. The means by which a material or combination of materials is dominant must clearly be stated. If a building material is selected as a unifying element, the color of that material shall also be specified, but the combination of the building material and its color shall only be credited as one unifying element. 
                  b.  Color(s). If selected, the dominant color or pattern of colors shall be specified within the guidelines. The means by which a color or pattern of colors is dominant and how that color(s) is to be used on the building facade must clearly be stated. A maximum of three colors may be designated as a primary unifying element, however, the number of colors within the development is not limited. Specifications for colors must be listed. Colored renderings are encouraged, but are not a substitute for specifications. 
                  c.  Architectural. If selected, the dominant architectural feature or combination of features shall be specified within the guidelines. The means by which an architectural feature or combination of features is dominant must clearly be stated. Architectural features include, but are not limited to: roof treatment, including style, material, and color of roof; facade treatments, including fenestration pattern and ornamentation; and building form, including overhangs, canopies, protective exterior walkways, and entrance treatments. 
                  Unity of development may include optional secondary unifying elements. Although secondary unifying elements are optional at the time of submittal, they will be a development requirement upon approval of the guidelines. Secondary unifying elements include landscaping, setbacks, heights, lighting, additional colors, or other elements which may be relevant to a specific development. 
                  Unity of development guidelines, and subsequent revisions and amendments, must be signed by the property owner. The revisions must be applied throughout the entire center or development. Within shopping centers or retail areas, where properties may be separately owned, the owner that controls the primary uses and structures of the unified development shall sign all guidelines and amendments thereto. 
                  (7)  Separation of buildings. All buildings established as part of a group development project shall be not less than 20 feet apart. 
                  (8)  Prohibited uses . In no case shall a use be permitted as part of a group development project that is prohibited by this chapter in the district in which the project is to be located.

                  Sec. 90-128. - General standards. 
                  (a)  Spaces to be separated from street. All offstreet parking and loading spaces, including maneuvering areas, hereafter established shall be separated from an abutting street by a nonaccess curb or planted strip. 
                  (b)  Width of driveways intersecting street. Except when a driveway intersects a state or federal highway, the maximum width of a driveway into a parking, loading or service area shall not exceed 35 feet, exclusive of curb return radii, and in such cases a curb return radius shall not exceed ten feet. In the case of a driveway which intersects a state or federal highway, the width of such driveway shall not exceed 50 feet, inclusive of curb return radii. 
                  (c)  Interior driveways. Interior driveways shall be at least 24 feet wide where used with 90-degree angle parking, at least 18 feet wide where used with 60-degree angle parking and at least 12 feet wide where used with 45-degree angle parking. Where used with parallel parking, or where there is no parking, interior driveways shall be at least 12 feet wide for one-way traffic movement and at least 20 feet wide for two-way traffic movement. 
                  (d)  Location of curb cuts. At the intersection of all streets, except lanes and alleys, a curb cut shall be set back not less than 25 feet from the intersection of two curblines or such lines extended, or shall be set back not less than 15 feet from the intersection of two property lines or such lines extended, whichever is the less restrictive. Between the curb returns for any two driveways serving the same property, there shall be at least 20 feet of curb, except that this distance may be reduced to as little as five feet where it is demonstrated that restricted frontage makes this necessary in order to provide not more than two adequate driveways for the property. 
                  (e)  Location in front yard. No required offstreet parking and loading space, including maneuvering areas for such offstreet parking and loading space, shall be established in a required front yard setback in any district except R districts. 
                  (f)  Prohibited use. No offstreet parking or loading area shall be used for the sale, repair, dismantling or servicing of any vehicles, equipment, materials or supplies. 
                  (g)  Surfacing. Offstreet parking areas for six or more cars, offstreet loading areas and maneuvering areas and passageways established in connection with such facilities shall be provided with a dustproof surface with adequate drainage facilities. 
                  (h)  Buffer for areas adjoining residential use. Where offstreet parking, loading or service areas are proposed to be located closer than 50 feet to a lot in any R zoning district or to any lot upon which there exists a dwelling as a permitted use under this chapter, and where such parking, loading or service areas are not entirely screened visually from such lot by an intervening building or structure, there shall be provided along the lot line a continuous visual buffer with a minimum height of six feet. No such buffer shall extend nearer to a street right-of-way line than the established building line of the adjoining residential lot, and no buffer shall be required along a property line immediately adjoining and parallel to a lane. The buffer shall be of a width determined by the board of zoning appeals, and shall contain within such width a compact evergreen hedge or other type of foliage screening, or a combined fence and shrubbery screen, the latter facing the adjoining residential lot. 
                  (i)  Reduction in size. Required offstreet parking and loading areas shall not be reduced in size or encroached upon in any manner that will reduce the number of offstreet parking and loading spaces below that required by this chapter.

                  Except as set forth in section 90-131, if the required offstreet parking space cannot reasonably be provided on the same lot as the building it serves, the board of appeals may permit such space to be provided on other offstreet property. In the case of multifamily dwellings, such property shall be within 300 feet of such dwellings as measured along the nearest pedestrian walkway. In the case of all other uses such property shall be within 600 feet of such other uses measured along the nearest pedestrian walkway. All such remote offstreet parking property shall be in the same possession as the lot on which is located the building it is to serve as an offstreet parking area. The remote parking space thus established shall thereafter be associated with that particular building for which it was established and shall not thereafter be reduced or encroached upon in any manner.

                  (6)  The petitioner requesting such zoning decision, or the applicant's agent, shall be recognized first and shall be permitted to present and explain the request for the zoning decision. Thereafter, all individuals who so desire shall be permitted to speak in favor of the zoning decision. 
                  (7)  After all individuals have had an opportunity to speak in accordance with subparagraph (6) above, those individuals present at the public hearing who wish to speak in opposition to the requested zoning decision shall have an opportunity to speak. 
                  (8)  The mayor may limit repetitious comments in the interest of time and may call for a show of hands of those persons present in favor of or opposed to the proposed decision. 
                  (9)  It shall be the duty of the mayor to maintain decorum and to assure the public hearing on the proposed decision is conducted in a fair and orderly manner.

                  (e)  Criteria for enactment. Prior to making a zoning amendment, the mayor and council shall evaluate the merits of a proposed amendment according to the following criteria: 
                  (1)  Is this request a logical extension of a zoning boundary which would improve the pattern of uses in the general area? 
                  (2)  Is this spot zoning and generally unrelated to either existing zoning or the pattern of development of the area? 
                  (3)  Could traffic created by the proposed use or other uses permissible under the zoning sought traverse established single-family neighborhoods on minor streets, leading to congestion, noise and traffic hazards? 
                  (4)  Will this request place irreversible limitations or cause material detriment on the area similarly zoned as it is or on future plans for it? 
                  (5)  Is there an imminent need for the rezoning and is the property likely to be used for the use requested? 
                  (6)  Would the proposed use precipitate similar requests which would generate or accelerate adverse land use changes in the zone or neighborhood?

                  Sec. 90-203. - Reasonable accommodation policy.

This section establishes a procedure for making requests for reasonable accommodations in land use, zoning, and development regulations as found and contained in this Code.

                  (b)  Reasonable accommodation in land use, zoning, and development context means providing individuals with disabilities or developers of housing for people with disabilities, flexibility in the application of land use, zoning, and building regulations, policies, standards, practices, and procedures, or even waiving certain requirements altogether, when it is necessary to eliminate legal and regulatory barriers to housing opportunities. 
                  (1)  For purposes of this section, an individual with a disability is someone who has a physical or mental impairment that limits one or more major life activities; anyone who is regarded as having such impairment; or anyone with a history of such impairment.

                  (2)  A request for a reasonable accommodation may be made by any individual with a disability, his or her representative, or a developer or provider of housing for individuals with disabilities, when the application of a land use, zoning, or development regulation, policy, standard, practice, or procedure acts as a barrier to fair housing opportunities.

The intent is to create an opportunity for and to promote the protection of the city's natural resources and promote growth in a way that will provide a healthy environment for the city's future. The purpose of this article is to provide standards for the protection of trees as part of the land development process; to prevent massive grading of land, both developed and undeveloped, without provision for replacement of trees; and to protect trees during construction whenever possible in order to enhance the quality of life within the city. The regulations of this tree protection and landscaping ordinance shall be the definitive, unless otherwise directed by the zoning ordinance or City Code of Ordinances. 
                  In accordance with this Ordinance, the owner/developer is to adhere to the following requirements: 
                  (1)  Site density requirements. 
                  (2)  Specimen tree requirements. 
                  (3)  Parking lot tree requirements. 
                  (4)  Landscape planting strip requirements. 
                  (5)  Buffer zones. 
                  (6)  Screening requirements. 
                  (7)  Building landscape requirements. 
                  It shall be the duty of the planning director, under authority of the city administrator, to enforce the provisions and requirements of this article. The planning director has the authority to issue a variance for no more than one of the requirements listed above. Variances for more than one of the requirements listed above must be approved by the Garden City Board of Appeals.

                  Tree protection area means any portion of a site wherein are located existing trees which are proposed to be retained in order to comply with the requirements of this article. The tree protection area shall include no less than the total area beneath the tree canopy as defined by the dripline of the tree plus any additional area encompassing the critical root zone of a tree or group of trees collectively. 
                  Tree protection plan means a plan that identifies tree protection areas, existing trees to be retained and proposed trees to be planted on a property to meet minimum requirements, as well as methods of tree protection to be undertaken on the site and other pertinent information. 
                  Tree removal means any act which causes a tree to die within two years after commission of the act, including but not limited to damage inflicted upon the CRZ or trunk as a result of: 
                  (1)  The improper use of machinery on the trees; 
                  (2)  The storage of materials in or around the trees; 
                  (3)  Soil compaction; 
                  (4)  Altering the natural grade to expose the roots or to cover the tree's root system with more than four inches of soil; 
                  (5)  Pruning judged to be excessive by the city or not in accordance with the standards set forth by the International Society of Arboriculture (ISA); 
                  (6)  Paving with concrete, asphalt, or other impervious surface within such proximity as to be harmful to the tree or its root system; and 
                  (7)  Application of herbicides or defoliates to any trees without first obtaining a permit. 
                  Tree save area: See Tree Protection Area. 
                  Tree thinning means selective cutting or thinning of trees for the clear purpose of appropriate forestry management in order to protect said forest from disease or infestation and in no way shall be construed as clear cutting. 
                  Undisturbed means un-graded, un-mowed, un-thinned, "un-encroached" 
                  Weeds means any undesired, uncultivated plant, especially one growing. In profusion so as to crowd out a desired crop, disfigure a lawn, etc. For the purposes of this article, weeds shall also include grass and/or underbrush in non-agriculturally used property, which is at least 12 inches tall. 
                  Zoning buffer means a buffer, as defined in and required by the zoning ordinance or as a condition of zoning, special exception, or variance approval for a specific property. 
                  (Ord. of 1-22-08, § 1) 
                  Sec. 90-253. - Applicability. 
                  (a)  The terms and provisions of this article shall apply to all activity which requires the issuance of a land disturbance activity permit on any real property within the city. No clearing, grubbing, grading, or other removal of existing vegetation that may affect the health of existing tree coverage may occur until it is determined that the proposed development is in conformance with the provisions of this article and other applicable city codes and regulations. 
                  (b)  Exemptions from the provisions of this article include the following project types: 
                  (1)  Grandfathered projects. Any property included within the limits of a LDA Permit (land disturbance activity permit) approved prior to the effective date of this article. 
                  (2)  Horticultural or agricultural operations. Land clearing for clearly agricultural purposes, including legitimate timber harvesting operations which qualify as forestry land management practices or agricultural operations as defined in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17, as amended, on land zoned for or used for forestry, silvicultural, or agricultural purposes; plant or tree nurseries; orchards, are exempt. 
                  This exemption shall not include tree harvesting incidental to the development of land, or tree harvesting on land that is anticipated to be developed for nonhorticultural uses. Further, the operation of legitimate timber harvesting shall provide a 50-foot undisturbed buffer measured from the property line provided and maintained along all road frontages, during the land disturbance activity, except for authorized access crossings. As a minimum the buffer shall meet the buffer standards stipulated in this Ordinance. 
                  Any persons or firms performing legitimate timber harvesting operations in any incorporated area of the city for delivery as pulpwood, logs, poles, or wood chips to any wood yard or processing plant located inside or outside the State of Georgia shall provide notice of such legitimate harvesting operations to the city administrator or the designated agent thereof prior to cutting any such timber. The notice to the city shall include: 
                  a.  Prior written notice of legitimate timber harvesting for each separate tract to be harvested thereby; 
                  b.  A map or the area which identifies the location of the tract to be harvested and, as to those trucks which will be traveling to and from such tract for purposes of picking up and hauling loads of cut forest products, the main point of ingress to such tract from a public road and, if different, the main point of egress from such tract to a public road; 
                  c.  A statement as to whether the timber will be removed pursuant to a lump sum sale, per unit sale, or owner harvest for purposes of ad valorem taxation under O.C.G.A. § 48-5-7.5; 
                  d.  The name, address, and daytime telephone number of the timber seller if the harvest is pursuant to a lump sum or per unit sale or of the timber owner if the harvest is an owner harvest; and 
                  e.  The name, business address, business telephone number, and nighttime or emergency telephone number of the person or firm harvesting such timber. 
                  The notice may be submitted in person, by transmission of an electronic record, via facsimile or by mail. 
                  The persons or firms subject to such notice requirement shall deliver a bond or letter of credit to the city, in which case notice shall not be or remain effective for such legitimate harvesting operations unless and until the person or firm providing such notice has delivered to the city administrator or its designated agent a valid surety bond, executed by a surety corporation authorized to transact business in this state, protecting the city against any damage caused by such person or firm in an amount specified by the city not exceeding $5,000.00 or, at the option of the person or firm harvesting timber, a valid irrevocable letter of credit issued by a bank or savings and loan association, as defined in O.C.G.A. § 7-1-4, in the amount of and in lieu of such bond. The surety bond or letter of credit shall be valid only for the calendar year in which delivered. 
                  The notice shall be effective for such harvesting operation on such tract within the city upon receipt of the same by the city or its designated agent and, if applicable, compliance with the above surety requirements of this section and until such time as the person or firm giving such notice has completed the harvesting operation for such tract; provided, however, that any subsequent change in the facts required to be provided for purposes of such notice shall be reported to the city or its designated agent within three business days after such change. 
                  Violation of the notice requirements of this section shall be punishable by a fine of $500.00. Each day of a violation shall be considered a separate offense. 
                  Once legitimate tree harvesting takes place in conformity with the above regulations, no other land disturbing activities shall be permitted on the entire property where the legitimate tree harvesting operations are conducted for a period of three years after completion of the legitimate tree harvesting operations. For purposes of this paragraph the last date of legitimate tree harvesting shall be the last day in which a legitimate tree harvesting operation is conducted. The property owner who conducts a legitimate tree harvesting operation within the city shall be required, within 30 days of the last day of legitimate tree harvesting operations, to deliver to the city administrator a written notice setting forth the last day of the legitimate tree harvesting operation and the identity and location of the property. Upon a property owner failing to timely notify the city administrator as provided above, the city administrator shall establish the last day of deforestation based upon the best information available, which estimated date shall not be rebuttable. 
                  (3)  The removal of diseased or infested trees. Removal upon advice and written finding of the county extension service, Georgia Forestry Commission, a certified arborist, or a state registered urban forester. 
                  The following matrix indicates which requirements of this Ordinance apply to each general zoning classification. Note: any requirement can be applied or removed through conditions of zoning or variance. 

                   
                  (Ord. of 1-22-08, § 1; Ord. No. 2008-18, § 1, 9-15-08) 
                  Sec. 90-254. - Permitting procedures. 
                  (a)  A tree removal permit is required to remove any tree from any property. The fee for obtaining a tree removal permit will be in addition to the land disturbance activity permit fee. Some tree removal permits may be granted without a tree removal fee. See, in this regard, code subsections 90-267(a)(1) and 90-271(e)(1)(a). If any tree larger than eight inches in diameter is removed from any property without a tree removal permit, the property owner shall pay a fine of three times the city's tree removal permit fee. Minimum required site tree densities must be maintained at all times. Failure to maintain the required tree densities may result in re-plantings. 
                  (b)  Prior to the submission of any permit drawings, the applicant is encouraged to meet with the planning director to discuss the tree protection/landscape ordinance as it relates to the applicant's property. The purpose of the pre-submittal conference is to clarify the provisions and procedures of this article and review applicable standards and guidelines for the submittal of documents, and required tree protection, replacement, and maintenance measures. 
                  (c)  A tree protection and replacement plan shall be prepared and submitted with other permit drawings, as part of the plan approval and/or land disturbance permit process to the planning and economic development department. These plans will be reviewed by the planning director for compliance with the city zoning ordinance and this Ordinance in particular and either approved, denied, or returned for revisions. Any comments will be made available to the designer for response or revision to the drawings. The plans shall then be resubmitted (along with previous red line comments), with the necessary changes, following the same procedure as if it were an original application. Issuance of a land disturbance permit is contingent upon approval of the tree protection plan/replacement plan. 
                  (d)  An approved tree protection and replacement plan must be implemented prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. When the developer/owner has installed the required landscaping improvements, he shall request an inspection by the city. If the city approves the installation, the project will be released for the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. If the city does not approve the plan, the city shall submit a report stating the reasons for disapproval so that the developer can make the necessary corrections. After the corrections have been made, a re-inspection shall be requested.

                  Sec. 90-255. - Tree protection and replacement. 
                  The trees in the City of Garden City are a city resource worth protecting and maintaining. Existing trees shall not be disturbed, except as provided in this article. No person shall cut carve or otherwise damage any tree. No person shall attach rope, wire, nails, or advertising posters to any tree. No person shall set fire or permit any fire to burn when such fire or the heat thereof will injure any portion of any tree. Any large, rare, or historically significant trees on a project site shall be highlighted by the designer (see section 90-259 "Specimen Trees"). It is required that all reasonable efforts be made to save specimen trees. "Reasonable effort" shall include, but not be limited to, alteration of building design, alternate building location, parking area, detention area, drainage system, or relocation of utilities. Careful thought and consideration is expected to be given to saving trees in the development process. 
                  (Ord. of 1-22-08, § 1) 
                  Sec. 90-256. - Planning and design consideration. 
                  (a)  Tree space is the most critical factor in tree protection throughout the site development process. The root system can easily extend beyond the dripline of the tree canopy. The root system within the dripline region is generally considered to be the critical root zone (CRZ). Disturbance within this zone can directly affect a tree's chances for survival. To protect these critical root zones the following planning considerations should be applied: 
                  (1)  The use of tree save islands and stands is encouraged rather than the protection of individual (non-specimen) trees scattered throughout a site. This will facilitate ease in overall organization as related to tree protection. 
                  (2)  The protective zone of specimen trees or stands of trees or otherwise designated tree save areas shall include no less than the total area defined as the critical root zone. 
                  (3)  Tree protection and grading requirements are two design constraints, which are most often in conflict. A grade change of a few inches can be detrimental to a tree, yet most sites require extensive cut and fill in order to manage drainage. The use of berms or retaining walls, instead of cutting, to provide detention should be used to preserve significant trees. Detention ponds can be designed around significant trees by adding depth to minimize width where possible. Retaining walls can also be used to mitigate cuts and fills. 
                  (4)  Underground water and wastewater lines, storm sewers, irrigation lines and both underground and overhead electric and telephone lines can have a considerable impact on trees. The layout of the project site utility plans should accommodate the required tree protective zones. Utilities should be placed along corridors between tree protective zones. Developers shall coordinate the location of utility lines, including irrigation and electric lighting, with the utility companies in order to prevent root damage within the critical root zones of protected trees and to minimize damage to trees located in protected zones. 
                  (5)  Construction activities such as parking, material storage, concrete washout, burnhole placement, etc. shall be arranged so as to prevent disturbances within tree protective zones. No disturbance shall occur within the protective zone of specimen trees or stands of trees without prior approval of the city. 
                  (6)  Sidewalks often appear innocuous on plans, but can be very detrimental to trees due to grading requirements. Considerations should be given to move sidewalks as far from tree trunks as possible and provide a finished grade above the existing grade for sidewalks required in close proximity to a tree trunk. Drainage can be routed under sidewalks where an elevated grade is required. 
                  (Ord. of 1-22-08, § 1) 
                  Sec. 90-257. - Protection of existing trees. 
                  (a)  Tree protection devices are necessary to eliminate activities detrimental to trees including, but not limited to: 
                  (1)  Soil compaction in the critical root zone resulting from heavy equipment, vehicular or excessive pedestrian traffic, or storage of equipment or materials; 
                  (2)  Root disturbance due to cuts, fills, or trenching; 
                  (3)  Wounds to exposed roots, trunks, or limbs by mechanical equipment; 
                  (4)  Other activities such as chemical storage, cement truck cleaning, fire, etc. 
                  (b)  Existing trees identified to be preserved and counted as credit towards meeting required site tree density shall have a four-foot tree protection fencing installed at the critical root zones. For methods of tree protection, see subsections (d)(1) through (d)(6) of this section 30-406. Tree protection devices shall be installed prior to the start of any land disturbance and maintained until final landscaping is installed. No construction activities are to occur within tree protection areas. Areas designated for parking, materials and equipment storage or staging areas are to be located outside of the drip line of existing trees. 
                  (c)  The city will conduct periodic inspections of the site before work begins and during clearing, construction, and post construction phases of development in order to ensure compliance with these regulations and the intent of this article. Tree protection must remain in functioning condition throughout all phases of development. Failure to comply with and/or maintain approved tree protection measures may result in a stop work order issued by the city. 
                  (d)  Methods of tree protection. The root system within the drip line is generally considered to be the critical root zone. Most trees can tolerate only a small percentage of critical root zone loss. To protect these critical root zones, a tree protection area shall be established around each tree or group of trees to be retained. The following section describes ways to help control unnecessary encroachment on existing trees. These methods and guidelines will be followed for tree protection throughout all phases of construction. These guidelines are designed to reduce damage to critical root zones and wounds to exposed roots, trunks, and limbs by chemical, mechanical, and other means. Tree protection areas will be delineated on tree protection plan and methods of protection will be clearly noted and detailed. 
                  (1)  Active protective barriers. Barriers shall be installed along the outer edge of and completely around the critical root zones of all specimen trees or stands of trees, or otherwise designated tree protective zones, prior to any land disturbance. Deviations from this must be approved on an individual basis by the city. Barriers will be a minimum four feet high. Construction of the fence shall conform to the detail provided in Appendix B [to this chapter]. All tree protection zones should be designated as such with "tree save area" signs posted visibly on all sides of the fenced in area. All tree fencing shall be maintained throughout the land disturbance and building construction, and should not be removed until all construction and landscaping is complete. 
                  (2)  Passive protective barriers. Tree save areas and their critical root zones not within 60 feet of any grading, storage, construction or traffic areas may be protected by four-foot orange plastic safety fencing or continuous plastic flagging. Tree protection materials shall consist of heavy mil, plastic flagging, a minimum four inches in width with dark letters reading "Tree Protection Area. Do Not Enter" or equivalent signage on a continuous durable restraint. Passive tree protection fencing is to be used only for areas remote from construction activity. 
                  (3)  Boring. No open trenching will be allowed within the protected zone as defined by the protective barricades. All underground utilities to be installed within this protection zone shall be installed by boring underneath the root zone. Any exceptions must be approved by the city. Utilities may be tunneled in the root zone at a twenty-four-inch minimum depth providing that plans are approved showing the location and method. 
                  (4)  Filling/clearing within root zone. Fill dirt no deeper than two inches may be allowed within the drip line of the tree. No grubbing is permitted in the root zone. In the protected root zone, any stumps, dead trees and shrub growth to be removed shall be cut flush or ground out. Stump grinding will be accomplished with equipment and methods acceptable in normal arboriculture operations. All holes will be backfilled completely the same day of the operation. 
                  (5)  Clearing adjacent to tree save areas. Roots often fuse and tangle amongst trees. The removal of trees adjacent to tree save areas can cause inadvertent damage to the protected trees. Wherever possible, it is advisable to cut minimum two-foot trenches (e.g. with a ditch witch) along the limits of land disturbance, so as to cut, rather than tear, the roots. Trenching may be required for the protection of specimen trees. The cutting down and then grinding the stump of the adjacent removed trees, as opposed to bulldozing them and ripping their roots, can also aid the protected trees. 
                  (6)  Tree removal. To minimize potential root loss from soil disturbance in an overlapping root situation. All roots attached to a tree inside a tree save area that extend outside the tree save areas shall be cut by hand if the soil is to be disturbed. The removal of any tree adjacent to a tree within a tree save area shall not be removed by heavy equipment. Cutting the roots by hand or with a ditch witch is acceptable. 
                  (Ord. of 1-22-08, § 1) 
                  Sec. 90-258. - Determination of site density factors. 
                  (a)  All projects within the city, with the exception of the construction of individual single-family and detached dwellings, shall maintain (in perpetuity) or exceed a minimum site density factor of 16 units per acre. 
                  Minimum tree site density shall be calculated as shown below 
                  EXAMPLE: 
                  Total acres 25 
                  - Area of buffers 5 
                  ____________ 
                  Net area 20 acres 
                  Required minimum site density = 16 units × 20 acres = 320 units required. 
                  (b)  The term "unit" is not synonymous with "tree." The density may be achieved by counting existing trees to be preserved, and or planting new trees in accordance with the minimum standards of this article, or some combination of the two. Unit values are computed as provided at Appendix C [to this chapter]. 
                  (c)  Existing and proposed trees outside established zoning buffers can be used for density credit. Proposed trees shall be reasonably distributed throughout the site with emphasis on tree groupings to achieve results following professional landscape standards. 
                  (d)  The minimum sized existing tree that will count toward tree density credit is eight inches caliper DBH. All existing trees that are to be counted toward meeting density requirements must be inventoried as specified in Appendix C [to this chapter]. 
                  (e)  New trees shall be provided utilizing a combination of shade/canopy trees and understory trees in a ratio of one to three. The site density requirement must be met whether or not a site had trees prior to development. 
                  (f)  Individual single-family lots are required to provide a site density factor of two tree units per acre. This density shall be achieved by planting a combination of shade/canopy trees and understory trees in a ratio of one to three with a minimum of one shade/canopy required. Shade/canopy trees shall be at least ten feet tall planted and have a trunk of not less than three caliper inches. Understory shall be at least six feet tall planted and have a trunk of not less than two caliper inches. A minimum of 50 percent of the required planting shall be placed in the front yard. All residential lots shall require that improvements be located so as to provide minimum disturbance to the natural topography of the site and protection to the maximum number of trees. Existing trees that are protected and saved on the lot can be credited toward the lot density requirement as well as the overall subdivision requirement. 
                  (g)  Where the proposed development area is so dense that the minimum site density factor can not reasonably be achieved, the development area shall be reduced by removing parking spaces in excess of the minimum number of spaces required by zoning, placing additional planting islands within the development area, or reducing the area to be occupied by buildings. A variance for parking must be filed with the city prior to such activities. 
                  (h)  Any tree, designated on the tree protection plan to be saved, which is damaged during construction or as a result of construction, as determined by the city, shall be replaced with a tree or trees equal to the unit value of the tree damaged. 
                  (i)  Trees which are used to meet the tree density requirements shall be maintained for two years after the date of final inspection and kept in perpetuity. It is the responsibility of the property owner to maintain tree health and vigor. Failure to maintain the required tree density factor at any time during the life of the project shall be a violation of this article. All unhealthy and dead plant material shall be replaced within 45 days in conformance with the approved landscaping plan. 
                  (j)  The developer/owner shall guarantee all plant materials for a minimum of two years from implementation. The city shall inspect said improvements and shall make a determination of whether or not the required trees and landscaping are healthy and have a reasonable chance of surviving to maturity. The owner shall be notified by letter of any replacements or restoration that must be made to maintain compliance with this article. All unhealthy and dead plant material shall be replaced within 45 days in conformance with the approved landscaping plan.

                  Sec. 90-259. - Specimen trees. 
                  (a)  Some trees on a site warrant special consideration and encouragement for protection. These trees are referred to as specimen trees. Trees unique due to age, size, species or historic relevance are to be identified during the survey process and special consideration must be made to work around them. It is required that all reasonable efforts be made to save specimen trees. Reasonable effort shall include, but [is] not limited to, alteration of building design, alternate building location, parking area, detention area, drainage system, or relocation of utilities. These trees are to be identified and highlighted on the tree protection plan. Design of buildings, hardscapes and utilities are to be developed with consideration to preserving and featuring specimen trees. 
                  (b)  The following criteria are used by the city to identify specimen trees. Both the size and condition criteria must be met for a tree to qualify: 
                  (1)  Size criteria: 
                  a.  Large hardwoods (oaks, poplars, sweetgums, etc.): Twenty-seven-inch diameter or larger. 
                  b.  Large softwoods (pines, deodar cedar, etc.): Thirty-inch diameter or larger. 
                  c.  Small trees (dogwoods, redbuds, sourwoods, etc.); Eight-inch diameter or larger. 
                  (2)  Condition criteria: 
                  a.  Life expectancy of more than 15 years. 
                  b.  Relatively sound and solid trunk with no extensive decay. 
                  c.  No more than one major and several minor dead limbs (hardwoods only). 
                  d.  No major insect or pathological problem. 
                  (3)  A lesser-sized tree can be considered a specimen tree, if in the judgment of the city: 
                  a.  It is a rare or unusual species or of historical significance. 
                  b.  It is specifically used by a builder, developer, or design professional as a focal point in a project or landscape. 
                  c.  It is a tree with exceptional aesthetic quality. 
                  (c)  Replacement of specimen trees. 
                  (1)  In the event any specimen trees are to be removed during the land development process, the applicant shall be required to replace the specimen trees being removed with suitable replacement trees. Removed specimen trees shall be replaced by species with potential for comparable size and quality. 
                  (2)  Specimen tree replacement will be required, in addition to the minimum required tree density requirements. 
                  (3)  Specimen trees that are removed must be replaced by trees, minimum three-inch caliper, and equal to the unit value of the specimen tree removed. 
                  (4)  Disturbance or encroachment into the critical root zone of a specimen tree exceeding 30 percent of the root zone will constitute the loss of the tree and require recompense as described in subsection 30-408(c)(3) above. 
                  (5)  In the event any specimen tree or trees should not survive more than 24 months following completion of development, the owner of the property shall be required to replace said tree or trees with replacement trees (three-inch minimum caliper) equal to the unit value of the specimen tree. 
                  (6)  Any specimen tree which is removed without appropriate review and approval of the city must be replaced by trees equaling two times the unit value of the specimen tree removed. The owner of the property shall be required to replace said tree or trees with replacement trees which will be four-inch minimum caliper. The condition criteria stated above will determine whether a tree was of specimen quality if the tree is removed without approval and there is not sufficient evidence of its condition. Such action may also result in a stop work order issued by the city.

                  l.  Where parking lots abut side or rear property lines or differing uses within mixed use developments the strip should contain a continuous evergreen hedge to screen the parking lot. When a parking lot abuts an undisturbed zoning buffer this requirement can be waived by the city. 
                  m.  Trees shall be planted at a minimum of three feet from any curb, so as to prevent injury to trees by vehicle bumpers. Where landscaped areas are located adjacent to vehicle overhangs, the trees shall be planted in line with the striping between parking spaces in order to avoid injury to trees by vehicle bumpers. Curb stops must be used to prevent vehicle overhang into required landscape strips and parking islands when curbing is not used. 
                  (Ord. of 1-22-08, § 1) 
                  Sec. 90-261. - Landscape planting strip requirements. 
                  (a)  Landscape strips shall be used to enhance the public appearance of any nonresidential property located along a public right-of-way. The following minimum requirements shall apply to landscape planting strips: 
                  (b)  Landscape strips. 
                  (1)  Landscape plantings shall be provided in a landscape strip of at least ten feet in width adjacent to any street right-of-way abutting the property and running the length of the entire property frontage, or as required by a condition of zoning, special use or variance approval. 
                  (2)  No permanent structures are permitted within landscape strips, with the exception of identification signage and light posts. This includes pavement, retaining walls, curbing, dumpsters, drainage structures, detention facilities, rip-rap, utility boxes, vacuum/air/water, etc. 
                  (3)  Landscape strips shall contain one canopy tree minimum two and one-half inch caliper per 50 feet and one understory minimum one and one-half inch caliper tree per twenty-five feet. Clumping is permitted provided that adequate spacing is allowed for future growth of the tree and there is no gap greater than 50 feet. 

                  (4)  The remaining ground area shall be sodded, seeded, or hydroseeded with grass, and/or planted with shrubs. Landscape strips located adjacent to parking lots must comply with the requirements of section 30-409.

                  Sec. 90-262. - Buffers. 
                  (a)  Buffers are required to achieve a visual barrier between properties of different use. However, existing or proposed plant material located within a buffer cannot be applied toward density requirements of a site. The area of a buffer can be subtracted from the total area of a site when calculating density requirements. 
                  (b)  Buffer widths shall be as indicated in this Ordinance or as allowed by variance or zoning conditions. Buffer plantings can be located within the setback limits required by zoning. In the case where buffer zones are wider than setback requirements, the buffer zones supersede. Unless otherwise directed by zoning or this Ordinance, buffers shall remain undisturbed. When existing vegetation exists in a buffer it shall be protected from encroachment during construction. 
                  (c)  Where buffers are void of existing vegetation adequate enough to provide a visual barrier or the buffers have been violated, the owner/developer is responsible for replanting. Refer to the buffer examples below for a formula based on the square footage of the entire buffer or portion thereof that is void of adequate material. 
                  (d)  Adequacy of the undisturbed buffers to provide a visual barrier will be determined by the city based on visual analysis and the types of existing plant material and reserves the right to require remedial evergreen understory planting if it is determined that the undisturbed buffer does not provide an adequate visual buffer. 
                  (e)  The city encourages the control or elimination of invasive plant material including Chinese Privet, Kudzu, Wisteria, etc. Selective clearing in buffers to remove noxious or invasive plant material and the methods of removal will require the approval of the city. Selective buffer clearing will be reviewed on a case by case basis. Removal of material may require the replanting to buffer standards if the buffer is over cleared. 
                  (f)  Buffer zones shall be provided as follows:

                  For all developments other than single-family residential subdivisions, trees planted to meet the requirements of this article shall be subject to a maintenance period. 
                  Fiscal surety for the maintenance of said trees shall also be required in accordance with procedures provided in this article. The amount of the surety shall be 110 percent of the cost of all required plant materials and the cost of the installation and guarantee of those materials. The surety may be in the form of an escrow agreement, letter of credit or maintenance bond. The surety shall be prepared on forms provided by the planning and economic development department. The expiration date of the surety instrument shall be determined as 30 months from issuance of the certificate of occupancy. 
                  If the original developer sells, transfers, assigns or conveys in any manner all or a portion of the property prior to the expiration date of the surety instrument, the original developer shall maintain the surety instrument until the expiration date. However, if an alternative surety instrument satisfactory to the planning and economic development department is provided by the subsequent owner of the property, the original developer may be partially or totally released from the developer's obligation under the original surety instrument upon receipt of written notification from the planning and economic development department accepting the alternative surety instrument. The alternative surety instrument must satisfy all requirements of the tree protection and landscape ordinance. 
                  Prior to the release date of the fiscal surety, an inspection will be performed by the city to determine the health of all planted trees. Any plant materials that are dead, missing or in a state of irreversible decline at the time of the inspection must be replaced by the responsible party named on the surety instrument. The planning and economic development department shall provide the responsible party with a written evaluation of what trees need to be replaced and the time frame within which replacement is to occur. 
                  All or part of the surety may be called if the conditions of the city's maintenance inspection letter are not met. 
                  It shall be the duty of any person or persons owning or occupying property subject to this article to maintain said property in good condition so as to present a healthy, neat, and orderly appearance. Property shall be kept free from refuse and debris. Planting beds shall be mulched to prevent weed growth and maintain soil moisture. Plant materials shall be pruned as required to maintain good health and character. Turf areas shall be mowed periodically. All roadways, curbs, and sidewalks shall be edged when necessary in order to prevent encroachment from adjacent grassed areas. 
                  All undisturbed buffers shall be maintained to insure the containment of invasive plant material. A listing of invasive plant material can be found in the "Invasive Plants of Georgia's Forests", published by the Georgia Invasive Species Task Force (www.gainvasives.org). The spreading of any material from the buffer onto adjacent property or into the public right of way is not permitted. The property owner is responsible for the control of this material and may be subject to a fine if these areas are not maintained.

                  Sec. 90-270. - Plant establishment. 
                  (a)  The city encourages and has adopted the use of xeriscape planting. A manual for xeriscape planting can be found in "Xeriscape: A Guide to Developing a Water-Wise Landscape" published by The University of Georgia Cooperative Extension Service (http://pubs.caes.uga.edu/caespubs/pubcd/B1073.htm). 
                  (b)  As a minimum to facilitate maintenance and help establish plant material required by this Ordinance, water shall be made available in the following method: 
                  (c)  Provide a water resource (hose connection) within 200 feet of all plantings to facilitate hand watering as necessary to establish planting. 
                  (Ord. of 1-22-08, § 1) 
                  Sec. 90-271. - Single-family residential requirements. 
                  The following requirements refer to owner-owned, single-family residential lots. This section does not pertain to developers. 
                  All of the information provided in this section can be found in previous sections of this article classified under the specific criteria or categories. The items listed below are an overview of the landscape ordinance requirements for a single-family residential lot owner. Refer to the specific section listed for any additional requirements that must be met. 
                  (a)  Site density requirements. (Refer to section 90-258). 
                  (1)  Individual single-family lots are required to provide a site density factor of two tree units per acre. This density shall be achieved by planting a combination of shade/canopy trees and understory trees in a ratio of one to three with a minimum of one shade/canopy required. Shade/canopy trees shall be at least ten feet tall planted and have a trunk of not less than three caliper inches. Understory shall be at least six feet tall planted and have a trunk of not less than two caliper inches. A minimum of 50 percent of the required planting shall be placed in the front yard. Improvements on residential lots shall be located so as to provide minimum disturbance to the natural topography of the site and protection to the maximum number of trees. Existing trees that are protected and saved on the lot can be credited toward the lot density requirement. 
                  (2)  The term "unit" is not synonymous with "tree." The unit density may be achieved by counting existing trees to be preserved, and or planting new trees in accordance with the minimum standards of this article, or some combination of the two. Unit values are computed as provided at Appendix C [to this chapter]. 
                  (3)  The minimum sized existing tree that will count toward tree density credit is eight inches caliper DBH. All existing trees that are to be counted toward meeting density requirements must be inventoried as specified in Appendix C [to this chapter]. 
                  (b)  Specimen tree replacement. (Refer to section 90-259). 
                  Some trees on a site warrant special consideration and encouragement for protection. These trees are referred to as specimen trees. Trees unique due to age, size, species or historic relevance are to be identified during the survey process and special consideration must be made to work around them. It is required that all reasonable efforts be made to save specimen trees. Reasonable effort shall include, but not limited to, alteration of building design, alternate building location, parking area, detention area, drainage system, or relocation of utilities. These trees are to be identified and highlighted on the tree protection plan. Design of buildings, hardscapes and utilities are to be developed with consideration to preserving and featuring specimen trees. 
                  (1)  The following criteria are used by the city to identify specimen trees. Both the size and condition criteria must be met for a tree to qualify: 
                  a.  Size criteria: 
                  1.  Large hardwoods (oaks, poplars, sweetgums, etc.): Twenty-seven-inch diameter or larger. 
                  2.  Large softwoods (pines, deodar cedar, etc.): Thirty-inch diameter or larger. 
                  3.  Small trees (dogwoods, redbuds, sourwoods, etc.); Eight-inch diameter or larger. 
                  b.  Condition criteria: 
                  1.  Life expectancy of more than 15 years. 
                  2.  Relatively sound and solid trunk with no extensive decay. 
                  3.  No more than one major and several minor dead limbs (hardwoods only). 
                  4.  No major insect or pathological problem. 
                  c.  A lesser sized tree can be considered a specimen tree, if in the judgment of the city: 
                  1.  It is a rare or unusual species or of historical significance. 
                  2.  It is specifically used by a builder, developer, or design professional as a focal point in a project or landscape. 
                  3.  It is a tree with exceptional aesthetic quality. 
                  (2)  Replacement of specimen trees. 
                  a.  In the event any specimen trees are to be removed during the land development process, the applicant shall be required to replace the specimen trees being removed with suitable replacement trees. Removed specimen trees shall be replaced by species with potential for comparable size and quality. 
                  b.  Specimen tree replacement will be required, in addition to the minimum required tree density requirements. 
                  c.  Specimen trees that are removed must be replaced by trees, minimum three-inch caliper, and equal to the unit value of the specimen tree removed. 
                  d.  Disturbance or encroachment into the critical root zone of a specimen tree exceeding 30 percent of the root zone will constitute the loss of the tree and require recompense. 
                  e.  In the event any specimen tree or trees should not survive more than 24 months following completion of construction, the owner of the property shall be required to replace said tree or trees with replacement trees (three-inch minimum caliper) equal to the unit value of the specimen tree. 
                  f.  Any specimen tree which is removed without appropriate review and approval of the city must be replaced by trees equaling two times the unit value of the specimen tree removed. The owner of the property shall be required to replace said tree or trees with replacement trees which will be four-inch minimum caliper. The condition criteria stated above will determine whether a tree was of specimen quality if the tree is removed without approval and there is not sufficient evidence of its condition. Such action may also result in a stop work order issued by the city. 
                  (c)  Screening. (Refer to section 90-263). 
                  Screening shall consist of the visual blocking of views of onsite service equipment and areas. The following items shall be screened as indicated below. 
                  (1)  Heating and cooling units for all developments including single-family shall be adequately screened with vegetation so as not to be visible from streets and/or adjoining properties. 
                  (2)  Plants shall be spaced so as to provide for effective visual screening within three growing seasons. 
                  (d)  Building landscape requirements. (Refer to section 90-264). 
                  This section relates to landscaping required adjacent to proposed buildings that are subject to this article including single-family residences. Any building subject to a building permit will be required to provide a five-foot-wide landscape strip along any face of the building that faces a public way. Landscaping in this area shall be comprised of a combination of shrubs and understory trees that soften the facade of the building. The following combination of plant material shall be provided: 
                  Building landscaping: 
                  a.  Provide one understory tree per 25 feet of building width. The required understory tree must be a minimum of six feet tall at installation and should be chosen from the city's approved plant list. 
                  b.  Provide one evergreen shrub per four linear feet of building width. The required shrub must be a minimum of 24 inches tall at installation. 
                  c.  Building width is defined as the width of the portion of the building that faced a public right-of-way. 
                  (e)  Single-family residential requirements; tree removal. 
                  (1)  Within the city, a tree removal permit is required prior to the removal of trees. A permit will be necessary regardless of whether a permit fee is assessed. Exemptions from permit fees include the following: 
                  a.  The removal of trees on actively residential or residentially-zoned property, without cost of a person or company engaged in removing the trees for a fee, shall not require the payment of any permit fee until more than three trees are removed at a time within a single calendar year. The removal of more than three trees at a time within a single calendar year will require a fee per acre based on the fee schedule determined by the city. 
                  (2)  Specimen tree removal regardless of location will require a permit. 
                  (3)  If any tree larger than eight inches in diameter is removed from any property without a tree removal permit, the property owner shall pay a fine of three times the city's tree removal permit fee. All contractors for tree removal must be licensed, bonded, and insured. 
                  (4)  Trees shall be removed in accordance with accepted industry standards and procedures and in accordance with the following minimum requirements: 
                  a.  Extreme care shall be taken so as to prevent limbs, branches, and trunks from falling and creating damage to adjacent homes, driveways, sidewalks, trees, shrubs, streets, and other property, both public and private. The city recommends that this type of work is to be undertaken only by trained personnel or under the supervision of trained personnel, all of whom are covered by workers compensation, property damage, public liability and completed operations insurance.

                  Sec. 90-305. - Airspace zones established. 
                  There are hereby created and established certain zones which include all of the land lying within the primary zone, precision instrument approach zones, nonprecision instrument approach zones, transition zones, horizontal zones and conical zones. Such areas and zones are shown on the Savannah International Airport Airspace Zoning Map dated June 1, 1985. Said map is made a part of this article to the same extent as if the information set forth on such map was fully designed and incorporated herein, and may be amended subsequent to the adoption thereof. Said map shall be kept on file in the office of the clerk of council of the city. The various zones established are shown in Illustration Number 1 and are defined as follows: 
                  (1)  Primary zone. An area longitudinally centered on a runway and extending 200 feet each end of that runway. The width of the primary zone is 1,000 feet for a nonprecision instrument runway having a nonprecision instrument approach with visibility minimums as low as three-fourths of a statute mile, and for precision instrument runways. No structure or obstruction will be permitted within the primary zone that is not part of the landing and take off facilities and is of a greater height than the nearest point on the runway centerline. 
                  (2)  Approach zones. An area longitudinally centered on the extended runway center line and extending outward from each end of the primary zone. An approach zone is designed for each runway based upon the type of approach available or planned for that runway end. 
                  a.  Precision instrument approach zone. An instrument approach zone is established at each end of precision instrument runways. The inner edge of the precision instrument approach zone shall have a width of 1,000 feet at a distance of 200 feet beyond each end of the runway. The inner edge shall then widen uniformly to a width of 16,000 feet at a distance of 50,200 feet beyond each end of the runway. 
                  b.  Nonprecision instrument approach zones. Nonprecision instrument approach zones are established at each end of the nonprecision runways. The inner edge of the nonprecision instrument approach zone shall have a width of 1,000 feet at a distance of 200 feet beyond each end of the runway. The inner edge shall then widen uniformly to a width of 4,000 feet for that end of a nonprecision instrument runway having a nonprecision instrument approach with visibility minimums as low as three-fourths statute miles. This type of approach zone extends to a horizontal distance of 10,200 feet beyond each end of the runway. 
                  (3)  Transitional zones. Transition zones are established adjacent to each precision and nonprecision instrument runway. They extend outward from the sides of the primary and approach zones and connect to the horizontal and conical zones. Transitional zones are further established adjacent to the precision instrument approach zone which projects through and beyond the limits of the conical zone, extending a distance of 5,000 feet measured horizontally, from the edge of the precision instrument approach zone perpendicular to the extended centerline of the runway. 
                  (4)  Horizontal zone. A horizontal zone is the area within the perimeter of a horizontal plane that is constructed by swinging arcs of specified radii from the center of each end of the primary surface of each runway of each airport and connecting the adjacent arcs by lines tangent to those arcs. The radius of each arc is 10,000 feet for all runways at the airport. 
                  The radius of the arc specified for each end of a runway will have the same arithmetical value. That value will be the highest composite value determined for either end of the runway. When a 5,000 foot arc is encompassed by tangents connecting two adjacent 10,000 foot arcs, the 5,000 foot arc shall be disregarded on the construction of the perimeter of the horizontal plane. The horizontal zone does not include the precision and nonprecision approach zones, and the transition zones. 
                  (5)  Conical zone. A conical zone is established as the area that begins at the periphery of the horizontal zone and extends outward therefrom a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet. The conical zone does not include the approach zones and transition zones. 
                  (Ord. of 10-21-1985, § 8-6006) 
                  Sec. 90-306. - Height limits established. 
                  Except as otherwise provided in this article, no structure or tree shall be erected, altered, allowed to grow, or maintained in any zone to a height in excess of the height limit herein established for such zone. If any structure or tree is erected, altered, allowed to grow, or maintained in an area located in more than one zone, then that structure or tree will be considered to be only in the zone with the more restrictive height limitation. The various zones are hereby established and defined as follows: 
                  (1)  Precision instrument approach zone. One foot in height for each 50 feet in horizontal distance, beginning at a point 200 feet from and at the center line elevation of the end of the instrument runway and extending to a distance of 10,200 feet from the end of the runway; thence one foot in height for each 40 feet in horizontal distance to a point 50,200 feet from the end of the runway. 
                  (2)  Nonprecision instrument approach zone. One foot vertically for each 34 feet in horizontal distance, beginning at a point 200 feet from, and at the centerline elevation of the nonprecision instrument runway and extending to a point 10,200 feet from the end of the runway. 
                  (3)  Transitional zone. This area extending outward from the sides of the primary zone and approach zones connecting them to the horizontal and conical zones. Height limits within the transitional zone are the same as the primary zone or approach zone at the boundary line where it adjoins and increases at a rate of one foot vertically for every seven feet horizontally, with the horizontal distance measured at right angles to the runway centerline and extended centerline, until the height matches the height of the horizontal zone or conical zone, or for a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet from the side of the part of the precision approach zone that extends beyond the conical zone. 
                  (4)  Horizontal zone. One-hundred and fifty feet above established airport elevation. 
                  (5)  Conical zone. The area extending outward from the periphery of the horizontal zone for a distance of 4,000 feet. Height limitations for structures in the conical zone are 150 feet above the airport height at the inner boundary with permitted height increasing one foot vertically every 20 feet to a height of 350 feet above the airport elevation.

                  Sec. 90-308. - Permits. 
                  (a)  No nonconforming structures or trees may be erected, replaced, substantially altered or repaired, rebuilt, allowed to grow higher, or replanted, in any zone created in this chapter unless a permit is secured from the zoning administrator, authorizing such replacement, change or repair, except as follows: 
                  (1)  No permit shall be required for any structure less than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground, except when because of terrain, land contour or topographic features such structure would extend above the height limits prescribed for the following areas: 
                  a.  Within the entire limits of the horizontal, conical, or transitional zones. 
                  b.  Within the limits of the precision instrument approach zones. 
                  (b)  Each application shall indicate the purpose for which it is desired, with sufficient particularity to determine whether the resulting use or structure would conform to the regulations prescribed in this article. If such determination is in the affirmative, the permit applied for shall be granted. 
                  (c)  No permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an airport hazard or permit a nonconforming use, structure or tree to be made or become higher, or become a greater hazard to air navigation, than it was on the effective date of this article, or than it is when the application for a permit is made. 
                  (d)  Whenever the zoning administrator determines that a nonconforming use, or nonconforming structure or tree, has been abandoned or is more than 70 percent torn down, destroyed, deteriorated, or decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow said structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations.
