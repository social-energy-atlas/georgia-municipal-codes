PREFACE
</p>
        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACEThis Code constitutes a complete codification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Monticello, Georgia.
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances adopted by the city council. The source of each section is
included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new
and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code,
the reader can locate any ordinance included herein.
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have
been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been
included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code.
Chapter and Section Numbering System
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes.
Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure
after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the
first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be
inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that
would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and
new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the
subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be
assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be
taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters.
Page Numbering System
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which
represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In
the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to
the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of
ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

CODE INDEX CDi:1
Indexes
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of
which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government
officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the
user to the particular item in which the user is interested.
Looseleaf Supplements
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this
system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or
pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of
inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages.
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received,
it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is
strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and,
in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.
Acknowledgments
This publication was under the direct supervision of Palmer Carr, Supervising Editor, and Robert MacNaughton, Editor, of the
Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere
interest and able assistance throughout the project.
The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Mark Harrison, former City Manager, Ms. Susan M. Roper, City Clerk, and Mr. R. Roy Kelly, III,
City Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and
those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens
and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

                  parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains

                  thereof for one continuous year immediately preceding the date of the election, and who is 21 years of age and a
                  qualified voter of said city, and who is otherwise qualified as provided in this section shall be eligible to be elected as

                  For purposes of electing the other four members of the city council, the City of Monticello is divided into two election
                  districts by the following described line, to wit: Beginning at the point where the Southern Railroad tract [tracks]
                  intersects the southern boundary of the Monticello city limits line; from that point northeast along the centerline of
                  the Southern Railroad track until it intersects Key Street; from that point southeast along the centerline of Key Street
                  until it intersects Blue Ruin Street; from that point northeast along the centerline of Blue Ruin Street until it intersects
                  with the Monticello city limits line.
                  Election District No. 1 shall contain all that territory and area within the city limits of Monticello which lies east and

                  Election District No. 1 shall designate the post for which he is seeking election and shall be a legal resident of
                  such election district. Candidates for the office of councilman from an election district shall certify at the time
                  of their qualification as candidates that they are residents of the election district from which they seek election.
                  To be elected as a member of the council from Election District No. 1, a candidate must receive the highest
                  number of votes cast for the particular post and, at the same time, the candidate must receive a majority of
                  the total votes cast for such post. The qualified voters of Election District No. 1 shall be authorized to vote for
                  one candidate for each post within such election district.
                  Two councilmen shall be elected from Election District No. 2 as described in paragraph (1) of this subsection.
                  Said election district shall have two posts, designated Post 1 and Post 2. A person offering as a candidate [for
                  election] to the council from Election District No. 2 shall designate the post for which he is seeking election and
                  shall be a legal resident of such election district. Candidates for the office of councilman from an election
                  district shall certify at the time of the [their] qualification as candidates that they are residents of the election
                  district from which they seek election. To be elected as a member of the council from Election District No. 2, a
                  candidate must receive the highest number of votes cast for the particular post and, at the same time, the
                  candidate must receive a majority of the total votes cast for such post. The qualified voters of Election District

                  held between the two candidates receiving the highest number of votes.
                  All elections shall be held and conducted in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 21-3-1 et seq., the `Georgia Municipal Election
                  Code,' as now or hereafter amended.

                  The mayor and councilmen of the City of Monticello serving on January 1, 1984, or any successors elected to fill vacancies
                  created by such mayor or councilmen, shall serve for the remainder of their unexpired terms. At the municipal election in

                  On the first Tuesday in January immediately following their election, the mayor and councilmen-elect shall meet in the
                  city hall or council chamber and there severally take, before some officer authorized to administer oaths under the laws
                  of this state, the following oath of office, to wit:
                  I do solemnly swear that I will well and truly demean myself as mayor (or councilman, as the case may be) of the City of

                  true valuation of all property subject to taxation in said city, according to its actual market value, so help me God.
                  Two of said assessors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, and any one of said assessors may

                  for in section 25 of this Act, any taxpayer gives notice to said assessors in writing that he or she desires to submit evidence relative to
                  the value of his or her property liable to assessment, it shall be the duty of said assessors to appoint a time and place to hear such
                  evidence, and hear same before assessing said property; provided, that the taxpayer is present and submits his evidence at the time
                  and place appointed; but if he be not present, either personally or by agent, or attorney, said assessors shall proceed to assess the value
                  of said property with or without hearing evidence, as they determine. If any person be dissatisfied with the valuation of his property as
                  fixed by the assessors, he shall have the right to appeal to the city council. Said appeal shall be entered within four days from the date
                  upon which the written or printed notice hereinafter provided for has been mailed by the clerk. Upon filing said appeal with the clerk of
                  said city, it shall be the duty of the mayor to fix a day upon which a hearing shall be had to give the appellant three days' notice in
                  writing of said hearing. Notice to the agent or attorney at law of said appellant shall be sufficient. At said hearing said city council shall

                  appeal.

                  of this return with the clerk, it shall be the duty of the mayor to notify the taxpayer that his return of personal property for taxation has
                  been excepted to by the city assessors, and fix a day upon which a hearing will be had; said notice shall be in writing, and shall be given
                  at least three days before the time of said hearing. Notice to the agent or attorney at law of said taxpayer shall be sufficient. At said

                  accordance with the numbering system of this Code and printed for inclusion herein. In the case of repealed chapters,
                  sections and subsections, or any part thereof, by subsequent ordinances, such repealed portions may be excluded from
                  the Code by omission from reprinted pages affected thereby. The subsequent ordinances, as numbered and printed, or
                  omitted in the case of repeal, shall be prima facie evidence of such subsequent ordinances until such time that this Code
                  and subsequent ordinances numbered or omitted are readopted as a new code by the mayor and council.
                  Amendments to any of the provisions of this Code may be made by amending such provisions by specific reference to the
                  section number of this Code in the following language: "That section ____________ of the Code of Ordinances, City of
                  Monticello, Georgia, is hereby amended to read as follows: ____________." The new provisions may then be set out in full as
                  desired.
                  If a new section not heretofore existing in the Code is to be added, the following language may be used: "That the Code of
                  Ordinances, City of Monticello, Georgia, is hereby amended by adding a section (or article or chapter) to be numbered
                  ____________, which said section reads as follows: ____________." The new section may then be set out in full as desired.
                  All paragraphs, subsections, sections, articles, chapters or provisions desired to be repealed should be specifically
                  repealed by paragraph, subsection, section, article or chapter number, as the case may be.
                  Sec. 1-9. - Supplementation of Code.
                  By contract or by city personnel, supplements to this Code shall be prepared on an annual basis. A supplement to the
                  Code shall include all substantive, permanent and general parts of ordinances passed by the city council during the
                  period covered by the supplement and all changes made thereby in the Code. The pages of a supplement shall be so
                  numbered that they will fit properly into the Code and will, where necessary, replace pages that have become obsolete or
                  partially obsolete, and the new pages shall be so prepared that, when they have been inserted, the Code will be current
                  through the date of the adoption of the latest ordinance included in the supplement.
                  In preparing a supplement to this Code, all portions of the Code which have been repealed shall be excluded from the
                  Code by the omission thereof from reprinted pages.
                  When preparing a supplement to this Code, the codifier, meaning the person, agency or organization authorized to
                  prepare the supplement, may make formal, nonsubstantive changes in ordinances and parts of ordinances included in
                  the supplement, insofar as it is necessary to do so to embody them into a unified code. For example, the codifier may:
                  Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions;
                  Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the
                  supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles;

                  Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the Code and, where necessary to acc
                  material, change existing section or other subdivision numbers;
                  Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc.,
                  as the case may be, or to "sections ____________ to ____________," inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of
                  the Code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code; and
                  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meanings of ordinance sections inserted
                  into the Code, but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material
                  included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code.
                  Sec. 1-10. - Altering Code.
                  It shall be unlawful for any person in the city to change or amend, by additions or deletions, any part or portion of this Code, or to
                  insert or delete pages or portions thereof, or to alter or tamper with such Code in any manner whatsoever except by ordinance or
                  resolution or other official act of the mayor and council, which will cause the law of the city to be misrepresented thereby. Any person
                  violating this section shall be punished as provided in section 1-12.

                  Any violation of this Code by any officer, agent or other person acting for or employed by any corporation or
                  unincorporated association or organization, while acting within the scope of his office or employment, shall in every case
                  also be deemed to be a violation by such corporation, association or organization.
                  Any officer, agent or other person acting for or employed by any corporation or unincorporated association or
                  organization shall be subject and liable to punishment as well as such corporation or unincorporated association or
                  organization for the violation by it of any provisions of this Code, where such violation was the act or omission, or the
                  result of the act, omission or order, of any such person.
                  Sec. 1-12. - General penalty.
                  Whenever in this Code or in any ordinance of the city any act is prohibited, is declared to be unlawful, whenever in such
                  Code or ordinance the doing of any act is declared to be unlawful, or whenever this Code places an affirmative duty upon
                  a citizen and that citizen fails to perform that duty, and no specific penalty is provided therefor, the violation of such
                  provision of this Code or any ordinance shall subject the person committing the violation to a fine not exceeding
                  $1,000.00 and costs or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or to both such fine and imprisonment, any
                  or all of such penalties to be imposed at the discretion of the municipal court judge.
                  In addition to the penalties provided in subsection (a) of this section, any conditions caused or permitted to exist in
                  violation of any of the provisions of this Code or any ordinance shall be deemed a public nuisance, and may be abated by
                  the city as provided by law, and each day that such conditions continue shall be regarded as a new and separate offense.
                  The infliction of a penalty under the provisions of this section shall not prevent the revocation of any permit or license or
                  the taking of other punitive or remedial action where called for or permitted under the provisions of the city's Charter or
                  Code.

                  It is essential to the proper administration and operation of the city that the members of its governing authority be, and give the
                  appearance of being independent and impartial; that public office not be used for private gain; and that there be public confidence in
                  the integrity of the governing authority. The governing authority finds that the public interest requires that they protect against such
                  conflicts of interest by establishing appropriate ethical standards with respect to the conduct of the members of the governing authority
                  in situations where a conflict may exist.
                  (Ord. No. 00-03-14-1, § 1, 3-14-00)
                  Sec. 2-152. - Denitions.
                  As used in this article, the term:
                  Complaint means a written sworn statement filed with the mayor or mayor pro tem containing specific allegations of misconduct by
                  a member; provided, however, such allegations must be filed within six months of discovery of the alleged misconduct.
                  Interest means any direct pecuniary benefit, which is not a remote interest held by or accruing to a member of the governing
                  authority as a result of a contract or transaction that is or may be the subject of an official act or action by or with the city. A member of
                  the governing authority shall be deemed to have an interest in transactions involving:
                  Any person in the member's immediate family;
                  Any person with whom a contractual relationship exists whereby the member may receive any payment or other
                  benefits unless the member is receiving a benefit for goods or services in the normal course of business for which
                  the member has paid a commercially reasonable rate;
                  Any business in which the member is a director, officer, employee, agent, or shareholder, except as otherwise
                  provided herein; or
                  Any person of whom the member is a creditor, whether secured or unsecured.

                  set forth sufficient facts to constitute an alleged violation and is found unjustified, frivolous or patently unfounded, it shall be dismissed

                  To hold a hearing within 60 days after the receipt of complaint. Failure to hold a hearing within the specified time
                  shall result in dismissal of the complaint as to the transaction and shall prevent refiling if a complaint arises in the
                  same incident for at least a period of six months;
                  To prescribe forms, approved by the city attorney, for the disclosure required in this article and to make available to

                  ARTICLE VI. - CODE OF CONDUCT FOR MAYOR AND COUNCIL
                  Sec. 2-181. - Conduct during meetings.
                  During the public portions of public meetings and public hearings, members of the Monticello Council shall not:
                  Speak without first being recognized by the mayor;
                  Interrupt anyone who has the floor;
                  Use profanity during the public portion of any meeting;
                  Refuse to yield the floor, or argue with the mayor, if he is ruled out of order by the mayor;
                  Make disparaging remarks about any person's character during the public portion of any meeting. By way of
                  example, it would be permissible to say "I cannot accept that," but it is improper to say "He's a liar," or "He can't be
                  trusted." Remarks should be limited to the subject under discussion, and shall not address the character of the
                  persons involved. Nothing herein shall limit or restrict the free and open debate of these matters in executive or
                  closed session.
                  Confront anyone about a prior statement in an accusatory manner during the public portion of any meeting. By way
                  of example, it would be permissible to ask someone if something different had been said on a prior occasion, and
                  the question should be phrased "Did you tell me ______________?" or "Do you remember telling me __________?"" It is
                  impermissible to say "Didn't you tell me ____________," or "Why did you tell me ___________ before the meeting?" The
                  purpose of the public portion of a council meeting is to allow each council member, city representative and
                  members of the public to state their positions in an orderly fashion; it is not a trial where persons are to be crossexamined, interrogated, belittled or held out for public ridicule or embarrassment. Nothing herein shall limit or
                  restrict the free and open debate of these matters in executive session.
                  State during the public portion of any meeting that a city employee has not done his or her job, or has not done his
                  or her job properly. By way of example, it would be permissible to ask if a city employee did or did not do a specific
                  task, but the question must be phased in such a way that a simple "yes" or "no" answer is all that is requested. It
                  would also be permissible to state or comment that a job was not done, or that it was not done correctly, so long as
                  the person responsible is not singled out for blame; remarks concerning the subject of job performance are proper,
                  but negative references to the person responsible are not. It is not proper to accuse city employees of not doing
                  their jobs, or doing them improperly, during the public portions of the meeting. City employees shall not be placed
                  in the position of responding to accusations of wrong-doing by a council member during the public portions of a
                  meeting (unless the meeting has been called as a hearing for the express purpose of determining disciplinary
                  action), nor shall their integrity or competency be challenged by a council member during the public portion of any
                  meeting. Nothing herein shall limit or restrict the free and open debate of these matters in executive session.
                  Represent their personal position or beliefs as being the positions or beliefs of the mayor and council as a whole. By

                  way of example, unless and until a majority vote has been obtained on a specific issue, a council member shall not
                  state that the council will or will not do something, nor shall a council member state what the board's vote will be on
                  an issue. No single council member can speak on behalf of the council unless specifically authorized by majority
                  vote to do so.
                  Refuse to recognize the validity of action approved by majority vote of the council. By way of example, a council
                  member is free to state that he does or does not agree with the majority vote, or that he would like to see the
                  majority reconsider its action and vote a different way. However, a council member shall not refuse to sign any
                  ordinance, resolution, contract or other legal document because he did not vote for the action taken. The minutes
                  shall reflect his opposition to the majority's decision, but he shall not be authorized to withhold his signature on the
                  basis that he did not vote for the action taken.
                  Divulge the subject matter of any confidential information, legal advice, or strategy discussions revealed during an
                  executive session. There may be occasions when a commissioner will be asked to make a specific commitment to
                  this rule in connection with a particular case. If a commissioner is unwilling to pledge his commitment to the other
                  members of the mayor and council, he shall be excluded from participating in that portion of the executive session.

                  Sec. 2-182. - Conduct outside of meetings.
                  A member of the Monticello Council shall not:
                  Direct any department head or city employee to do a job or to perform a task. All such requests shall be made to
                  the city manager. Once such a request is made, the mayor and council shall follow up with the city manager
                  regarding the performance of the work, not with the department head or the city employee whom the council
                  member expects to do the job. If the job is not performed to the commissioner's satisfaction, this shall be taken up
                  with the city manager first; if the council member is still not satisfied, the matter shall next be discussed with all
                  members of the mayor and council in executive session, under the exemption to the Open Meetings Act for
                  discussion of employee performance. There shall be no criticism or disparaging remarks made about any city
                  employee in a public meeting unless and until all of these steps have been exhausted.
                  Publicly state that he intends to fire or discipline any city employee. No single council member has the authority to
                  hire or fire city personnel.
                  Reprimand any city employee. If a council member believes a city employee should be reprimanded he shall so
                  inform the city manager. If a council member believes the city manager should be reprimanded he shall notify the
                  other members of the mayor and council. No single council member has the authority to discipline city personnel.
                  Use of profanity, insulting or demanding words about a city employee in the presence of that employee, or in the
                  presence of other city employee.
                  Call into question the qualifications or competency of a city employee in the presence of that employee, or in the
                  presence of any other city employee. Concerns of this nature shall be addressed in the stages outlined in Section II,
                  Rule I, above.
                  Demand that the city managers or any department head stop what he or she is doing and immediately attend to the
                  council member's business. If the city manager or department head requests that the council member schedule a
                  time to discuss a matter that is mutually convenient to all concerned, the council member shall honor that request.
                  Promise on behalf of the city or the mayor and council to undertake any act, or to pass any ordinance, resolution,
                  contract or agreement. A single council member has no authority to bind the mayor and council.
                  Agree to buy or sell anything of value on behalf of the city without advance approval by a majority vote of the mayor
                  and council.
                  Attempt to negotiate city business with any private party or any representative of another governmental unit
                  without the advanced approval of a majority of the mayor and council. By way of example, it is permissible for any

                  council member to discuss city business in general terms with private parties and representatives of other
                  governmental units (unless there is actual or threatened litigation against Monticello by the parties involved).
                  However, a council member shall not make any written offers, draft any agreements, edit or revise any proposed
                  agreements or plans, or suggest or propose (whether orally or in writing) any specific terms concerning money or
                  services to be provided or received by the city unless that council member has received express authorization in
                  advance by a majority vote of the mayor and council. The fact that the subject matter involves property or persons
                  in a council member's district is of no consequence, as a council member has no additional legal authority over a
                  matter simply because it is in his district.
                  Speak to any representative of the news media on behalf of the city council without advance approval by a majority
                  vote of the mayor and council. By way of example, a council member is free to express his personal views or
                  opinions to anyone. However, a commissioner shall not make a statement in the name of the mayor and council or
                  in the name of Monticello unless he has been authorized in advance to do so by majority vote of the mayor and
                  council.

                  Sec. 2-183. - Penalties.
                  The mayor and council shall have the responsibility to police itself and to enforce this article. Any council member shall have the
                  right to bring a suspected violation of the ordinance to the attention of the full council. Any such accusation may be deliberated upon in
                  executive session, but a vote upon any penalty to be imposed must be taken in open, public session, with all members of the mayor and
                  council present. If the council determines by majority vote that a violation of this article has occurred, the council shall have the
                  authority to impose one or more of the following penalties upon the offending council member:
                  A verbal censure that shall be noted in the minutes without further elaboration;
                  A written censure, to be made a part of the minutes, specifically outlining the facts underlying the violation;
                  Removal of the council member from membership on any committee, association or group in which the offending
                  council member is in involved in his capacity as a member of the mayor and council; removal shall take place by the
                  delivery of a letter, signed by the mayor and council, to the head of such committee, association, or group, stating
                  that the offending council member is no longer authorized to represent Monticello on said committee. This sanction
                  shall last for a period of up to one year from the date of offence;
                  A fine not to exceed $500.00 per offense, which shall be paid by the offending council member to the general fund
                  of Monticello, Georgia within ten days of the mayor and council's vote establishing a violation; if the offending
                  council member fails to make this payment within the time specified herein, the amount of the penalty shall be
                  withheld from the offending council member's compensation as a council member.
                  The decision of the Monticello Mayor and Council on any question concerning a violation of this article, or the penalty
                  imposed, shall be final, it being intent of all the council member to govern themselves, and not to abdicate this
                  responsibility to any other person or entity.

                  The purpose of this article is to regulate certain types of businesses including, but not limited to, adult entertainment
                  establishments, to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses will be curtailed.

                  protection of the neighborhoods through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments versus the protected rights of adult

                  It is found and declared that there exist in the city dwellings, buildings, structures, and properties which are unfit for human
                  or for commercial, industrial or business uses and not in compliance with the applicable standard codes or optional building
                  safety, or other codes adopted by the city; or in violation of general nuisance law and which constitute a hazard to the health
                  and welfare of the people; and that a public necessity exists for the repair, closing or demolition of such dwellings, buildings
                  structures. It is further found and declared that where there is a condition or use of real estate which renders adjacent real
                  unsafe or inimical to safe human habitation, such use is dangerous and injurious to the health, safety, and welfare of the pe
                  public necessity exists for the repair of such condition or the cessation of such use. This city should exercise its police power
                  close or demolish the aforesaid dwellings, buildings or structures and/or cause the repair of such conditions or the cessation
                  use in the manner provided in this section.
                  All the provisions hereof may also be applied to private property where there is an endangerment to the public health or
                  safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions to those persons residing or working in the vicinity. A finding by any
                  governmental health department, health officer or building inspector that such property is a health or safety hazard shall
                  constitute prima facie evidence that such property is in violation of this section.

                  to construct or maintain any dwelling, building, structure or property in violation of such codes or regulations.
                  It shall be unlawful and a misdemeanor for any owner, whether directly or through an agent, to own any structure or
                  property which is unfit for human habitation or is unfit for its current commercial, industrial or business use and not in
                  compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or
                  constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, or is otherwise

                  Sec. 30-40. - Enforcement procedure.
                  When a request is filed with the public officer by a public authority or by at least five residents of the city charging that
                  any dwelling, building, structure or property is unfit for human habitation or for commercial, industrial or business use or
                  when it appears to the public officer (on his own motion) that any dwelling, building, structure or property is unfit for

                  codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to
                  the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the public officer shall make an investigation or
                  inspection of the specific dwelling, building, structure, or property.
                  If the officer's investigation or inspection identifies that any dwelling, building, structure, or property is unfit for human habitation or

                  The officer shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner and any parties in interest in such dwelling, building,
                  structure or property summons and a complaint containing a notice that a hearing will be held in municipal court not less
                  than 15 days nor more than 45 days after the serving of the complaint; that the owner and any parties in interest shall be
                  given the right to file an answer to the complaint and to appear in person, or by attorney, and give testimony at the place
                  and time fixed in the complaint.

                  The complaint shall identify the subject real property by appropriate street address and official tax map reference;
                  identify the owner and parties in interest; state with particularity the factual basis for the action; and contain a statement
                  of the action sought by the public officer to abate the alleged nuisance.
                  If, after the hearing, the court determines that the dwelling, building, structure, or property under consideration is unfit
                  for human habitation or is unfit for its current commercial, industrial or business use and not in compliance with
                  applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an
                  endangerment to the public health or safety as a result or unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the court shall state in writing
                  its findings of fact in support of such determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner and any
                  parties in interest that have answered the complaint or appeared at the hearing an order:
                  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of such dwelling, building, structure, or property can be made at a
                  reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, structure, or property, requiring the owner,
                  within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter or improve such dwelling, building, structure, or property so as
                  to bring it into full compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violation and, if applicable, to secure
                  the structure so that it cannot be used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or
                  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of such dwelling, building, structure, or property in order to bring it into full
                  compliance with applicable codes relevant to the cited violations cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to
                  the present value of the dwelling, building, structure, or property, requiring the owner within the time specified in
                  the order, to remove or demolish such dwelling, building or structure and all debris from the property.
                  If the court finds there is a condition or use of real estate other than addressed above, which renders adjacent real
                  estate unsafe or inimical to safe human habitation and the court further finds that such use is dangerous and
                  injurious to the health, safety and welfare of the people and that a public necessity exists for the repair of such
                  condition or the cessation of such use, the court may order the cleaning or removal of debris, trash and other
                  materials present and accumulated which create a health or safety hazard in or about any dwelling, building or
                  structure, and the order may require the abatement of the public health hazard or general nuisance to eliminate the
                  endangerment to the public health or safety.
                  For the purposes of this Code section, the court shall make its determination of "reasonable cost in relation to the
                  present value of the dwelling, building or structure" without consideration of the value of the land on which the structure
                  is situated; provided however, that costs of the preparation necessary to repair, alter, or improve a structure may be
                  considered. Income and financial status of the owner shall not be a factor in the court's determination.
                  The present value of the structure and the costs of repair, alteration, or improvement may be established by affidavits of
                  real estate appraisers with a Georgia appraiser classification as provided in O.C.G.A. Chapter 39A of Title 43, qualified
                  building contractors, or qualified building inspectors without actual testimony presented. Costs of repair, alteration, or
                  improvement of the structure shall be the cost necessary to bring the structure into compliance with the applicable codes
                  relevant to the cited violations in force in the city.
                  If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair, alter, improve or demolish the dwelling, building, structure, or
                  property, or to abate the nuisance to eliminate the endangerment to the public health or safety, the public officer may
                  cause such dwelling, building, structure, or property to be repaired, altered or improved or to be vacated and closed or
                  demolished. Such abatement action shall commence within 270 days after the expiration of time specified in the order
                  for abatement by the owner. Time during any court stay on abatement shall not count toward said 270 days. The public
                  officer shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of the building, dwelling, structure, or property a placard with the
                  following words:
                  "This building, dwelling, structure, or property is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business use
                  and does not comply with the applicable codes or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with drug
                  crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use
                  or occupation of this building, dwelling, structure, or property is prohibited and unlawful."

                  fees, administrative costs incurred by the tax commissioner, and all other costs necessarily associated with the
                  abatement action, including restoration to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be a lien against the real
                  property upon which cost was incurred. Credit for salvage material sold, per [subsection] (e) below, shall be given. Such
                  lien shall attach to the real property upon the filing of a certified copy of the order in the office of the Clerk of Greene
                  County Superior Court and shall relate back to the date of the filing of the lis pendens notice required under this section.
                  The clerk shall record and index such order in the deed records and enter the lien on the general execution docket. The lien shall be
                  superior to all other liens on the property, except liens for taxes, and shall continue in force until paid. After filing the order with the
                  clerk, and within 90 days of the repair, demolition or closure, the public officer shall forward a copy of the order and a final settlement
                  of costs to the county tax commissioner.
                  It shall be the duty of the county tax commissioner to collect the amount of the lien in conjunction with the collection of ad valorem
                  taxes on the property and to collect the amount of the lien as if it were a real property ad valorem tax, using all methods available for
                  collecting real property ad valorem taxes, including specifically O.C.G.A. Chapter 4 of Title 48; provided, however, that the limitation of
                  O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 which requires 12 months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure shall not apply.
                  The tax commissioner shall remit the amount collected to the city. Thirty days after imposition of the lien, the unpaid lien amount
                  shall bear interest and penalties in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes.
                  If the dwelling, building or structure is removed or demolished by the public officer, reasonable efforts shall be made to
                  salvage and sell reusable materials at private or public sale, and the proceeds of such sale shall be credited against the
                  cost of the removal or demolition, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Such sale shall
                  be made without public advertisement and bid. The public officer and the city shall have no liability related to such sale,
                  including due to defects. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to impair or limit in any way the power of the city

                  If such finding of the public officer is contested by the occupants of the structure, then the public officer shall request an
                  immediate hearing before the judge of the magistrate court in order to secure an order requiring any occupants of the
                  unsafe structures to vacate. The public officer shall then proceed as set forth in this section.

                  from a distance of 100 feet.

                  Sec. 30-68. - Specic prohibitions.
                  The following acts when plainly audible from a distance of 100 feet are declared loud noises in violation of this article; but such
                  enumeration shall not be deemed to be exhaustive:
                  The excessive sounding of any horn on any motor vehicle except as a warning signal.
                  Causing to be played, used or operated any radio, tape player, compact disc player, instrument, television, or other
                  device for the producing or reproducing of sound between 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. (or at other hours if plainly
                  audible from a distance of 200 feet) so as to disturb the residents of the area.
                  Causing the operation on or within 100 feet of public property, of any drum or sound amplifying device or other
                  machine or device for the producing or reproducing of sound unless a permit for such drum or sound amplification
                  has been obtained from the city.
                  Causing the operation of any equipment or the performance of any outside construction within the city between
                  10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. unless of an emergency nature or when a permit for such has been obtained from the city.
                  Causing the discharge of the exhaust of any engine, including without limitation engines in passenger vehicles, light
                  trucks, motorcycles, road tractor units of tractor trailers, dump trucks, fuel trucks and garbage trucks and all other
                  heavy trucks, and delivery trucks and all other medium duty trucks, except through a muffler or other device which
                  should effectively prevent loud noises.
                  No person shall slow a heavy truck, medium truck, diesel light truck, or other truck over 10,000 pounds Gross
                  Vehicle Weight Rating by using a "Jake brake", which is an engine or exhaust or turbocharger brake for diesel
                  engines, with a primary use on long downhill grades where the wheel brakes would otherwise have to be frequently
                  pumped to keep the truck from gaining dangerous speed. Considering the size and topography of the city, the loud
                  noise of jake brake use outweighs any arguable benefit of such brake. The brakes shall be used instead, except in
                  the event of an emergency.
                  The keeping of any animal or bird which by frequent or continuous noise disturbs the residents of the area.
                  Causing the repairing, rebuilding or testing of any motor vehicle between 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. (or at other
                  hours if plainly audible from a distance of 200 feet) within any residential area in such a manner as to disturb the
                  residents of the area.
                  The creating of any noise adjacent to any hospital, school, court, or church while in use, which disturbs the patients,
                  employees, students, occupants and/or members thereof.
                  Causing to be played, used, or operated in any vehicle, either stationary or mobile, any radio, tape player, compact
                  disc player, instrument or other device for the producing of sound plainly audible from a distance of 100 feet or
                  more so as to disturb the residents or any other affected persons in the area.

                  This article shall apply to any land-disturbing activity undertaken by any person on any land except for the following:
                  Surface mining, as the same is defined in O.C.G.A. 12-4-72, "The Georgia Surface Mining Act of 1968."
                  Granite quarrying and land clearing for such quarrying;
                  Such minor land-disturbing activities as home gardens and individual home landscaping, repairs, maintenance work,
                  fences, and other related activities which result in minor soil erosion;
                  The construction of single-family residences, when such construction disturbs less than one acre and is not a part of
                  a larger common plan of development or sale with a planned disturbance of equal to or greater than one acre and
                  not otherwise exempted under this paragraph; provided, however, that construction of any such residence shall
                  conform to the minimum requirements as set forth in O.C.G.A. 12-7-6 and this paragraph. For single-family
                  residence construction covered by the provisions of this paragraph, there shall be a buffer zone between the
                  residence and any state waters classified as trout streams pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of the Georgia Water
                  Quality Control Act. In any such buffer zone, no land-disturbing activity shall be constructed between the residence
                  and the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action from the banks of the trout
                  waters. For primary trout waters, the buffer zone shall be at least 50 horizontal feet, and no variance to a smaller
                  buffer shall be granted. For secondary trout waters, the buffer zone shall be at least 50 horizontal feet, but the
                  director may grant variances to no less than 25 feet. Regardless of whether a trout stream is primary or secondary,
                  for first order trout waters, which are streams into which no other streams flow except for springs, the buffer shall
                  be at least 25 horizontal feet, and no variance to a smaller buffer shall be granted. The minimum requirements of
                  subsection (b) of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 and the buffer zones provided by this paragraph shall be enforced by the local
                  issuing authority;
                  Agricultural operations as defined in O.C.G.A. 1-3-3, "definitions," to include raising, harvesting or storing of
                  products of the field or orchard; feeding, breeding or managing livestock or poultry; producing or storing feed for
                  use in the production of livestock, including but not limited to cattle, calves, swine, hogs, goats, sheep, and rabbits

                  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requ
                  of this article and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not e
                  by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and prac
                  provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and
                  control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections 30-89(b) and (c). The application
                  measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and o
                  temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pol
                  during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES general permi
                  Minimum requirements/BMPs.
                  Best management practices as set forth in subsections 30-89(b) and (c) shall be required for all land-disturbing
                  activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete
                  defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this
                  subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of storm water issued pursuant
                  to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act." As used in this subsection the terms
                  "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications
                  contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. 12-7-6 subsection (b).
                  A discharge of storm water runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly
                  designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a
                  local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. §
                  12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of
                  receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water
                  fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the
                  receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall
                  not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a
                  larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or
                  greater than five acres.
                  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any landdisturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to
                  subsection (f) of Code Section § 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such failure
                  occurs.
                  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring
                  of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur.
                  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsection 30-89(c)(15) and (16), in light of
                  O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c).
                  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et. seq. for the purpose of
                  governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general
                  permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and
                  minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices
                  contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water
                  Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the
                  following:
                  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to
                  minimize erosion;
                  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum;
                  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion
                  potential;
                  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented;

                  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum;
                  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable;
                  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development;
                  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable;
                  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins,
                  silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is
                  stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. 12-7-1 et.
                  seq.;
                  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the
                  sloping of fills;
                  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property;
                  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect
                  other property owners;
                  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not
                  feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum;
                  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment
                  or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or
                  preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection 30-89(b)(2);
                  Except as provided in paragraph (16) of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all
                  state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or
                  wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural
                  resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a
                  drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control
                  measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral
                  stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream: that under normal circumstances
                  has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above
                  the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from
                  precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at
                  least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control
                  Act," shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following
                  requirements shall apply to any such buffer:
                  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural,
                  undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once
                  the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a
                  protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in
                  sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a singlefamily residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own
                  occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to
                  protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on
                  the stream bed; and
                  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as
                  measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of
                  disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are
                  incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water
                  lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and
                  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested

                  Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," except where a roadway drainage
                  structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which
                  discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped,
                  at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by
                  the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner
                  complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such
                  buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the
                  project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer:
                  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural,
                  undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once
                  the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a
                  protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in
                  sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a singlefamily residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own
                  occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to
                  protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on
                  the stream bed; and
                  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as
                  measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of
                  disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are
                  incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water
                  lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines.
                  [Local requirements.] Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. 12-7-1 et. seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting
                  rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum
                  requirements in subsection 30-89(b).
                  [Issuance of permit not to constitute proof or presumption of violations.] The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a
                  permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a
                  presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit.

                  Sec. 30-90. - Application/permit process.
                  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal
                  the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area
                  surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, storm water management ordinance, subdivision ordinance,
                  flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate
                  the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or
                  operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit.
                  Application requirements.
                  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the City of Monticello
                  without first obtaining a permit from the zoning administrator to perform such activity and providing a copy of
                  notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable.
                  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the zoning administrator and must include the applicant's
                  erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a
                  minimum, the data specified in subsection 30-90(c). Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together
                  with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed will be carried out
                  in such a manner that the provisions of subsection 30-89(b)and (c) will be met. Applications for a permit will not be

                  All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site
                  prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10.
                  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to paragraph (5) subsection (a) of
                  O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23, provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these
                  fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of
                  land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall
                  be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to subsection (a)
                  of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8 half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from
                  an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to paragraph (9) or (10) of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17 shall be submitted
                  in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction.
                  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the
                  application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the
                  erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of
                  receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results
                  of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has
                  been approved by the district, and any variances required by subsection 30-89(c)(15) and (16) has been obtained, all
                  fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per subsection 30-90(b)(6), have been obtained. Such review will
                  not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local
                  issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the
                  district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal
                  within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall
                  be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal.
                  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this article, or the Erosion and
                  Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration,
                  the local issuing authority may deny the permit application.
                  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security,
                  cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction
                  thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with
                  this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any
                  part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing
                  activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or
                  statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing
                  authority with respect to alleged permit violations.
                  Plan requirements.
                  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in subsections 30-89(b) and (c), or

                  practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this
                  article. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and
                  hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including
                  roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and storm water management facilities, local ordinances and
                  state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design
                  professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or
                  inspections or any land disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements,
                  dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation
                  with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20.

                  Permits.
                  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by the
                  local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary
                  and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the
                  activity may be undertaken.
                  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan
                  has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in
                  compliance with this article, any variances required by subsection 30-89(c)(15) and (16) are obtained, bonding
                  requirements, if necessary, as per subsection 30-90(b)(6) are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in
                  effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason
                  for denial shall be furnished to the applicant.
                  Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this
                  ordinance, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the
                  division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority.
                  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase.
                  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the
                  land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the
                  approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this
                  article. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by
                  the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit.
                  The LIA may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the
                  Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light
                  of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7 (f)(1).

                  Sec. 30-91. - Inspection and enforcement.
                  The zoning administrator will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been
                  issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the
                  plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary,
                  secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be
                  responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting
                  land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best
                  management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall
                  be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If,
                  through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply
                  with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this ordinance, a written notice to comply shall
                  be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the
                  time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply
                  within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article.
                  The local issuing authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within 12 months of any amendments to
                  the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975.
                  The zoning administrator shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to
                  carry out duties as prescribed in this ordinance, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property,
                  public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities.
                  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the

                  carrying out his official duties.
                  The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities, which have
                  been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). The district or the commission or both may
                  provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county or
                  municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The district or the commission shall notify the
                  division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found.
                  The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities, which have been certified as local issuing
                  authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the
                  administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if
                  any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county
                  or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not
                  conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-7(e), the division shall
                  notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or
                  municipality so notified shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a
                  local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within 90 days after
                  notification by the division, the division shall revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing
                  authority.

                  Sec. 30-92. - Penalties and incentives.
                  Failure to obtain a permit for land-disturbing activity. If any person commences any land-disturbing activity requiring a
                  land-disturbing permit as prescribed in this ordinance without first obtaining said permit, the person shall be subject to
                  revocation of his business license, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a business and associated work
                  activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority.
                  Stop-work orders.
                  For the first and second violations of the provisions of this article, the director or the local issuing authority shall
                  issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have five days to correct the violation. If the violation is not
                  corrected within five days, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a stop-work order requiring that
                  land-disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided,
                  however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the landdisturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the director or the local issuing authority
                  shall issue an immediate stop-work order in lieu of a warning;
                  For a third and each subsequent violation, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stopwork order; and
                  All stop-work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary
                  corrective action or mitigation has occurred.
                  When a violation in the form of taking action without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer, or significant
                  amounts of sediment, as determined by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee, have
                  been or are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not been properly
                  designed, installed, and maintained, a stop work order shall be issued by the local issuing authority or by the
                  director or his or her designee. All such stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be
                  in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop work orders shall apply to all
                  land-disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or
                  permanent erosion and sediment controls.
                  Bond forfeiture. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities has failed to

                  measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which such measures must be
                  completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be
                  deemed in violation of this ordinance and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to have forfeited his
                  performance bond, if required to post one under the provisions of subsection 30-90(b)(6). The local issuing authority may
                  call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the
                  land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance.
                  Monetary penalties.
                  Any person who violates any provisions of this article, or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant to
                  this article, or who negligently or intentionally fails or refuses to comply with any final or emergency order of the
                  director issued as provided in this article shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 per day. For the
                  purpose of enforcing the provisions of this article, notwithstanding any provisions in any city charter to the contrary,
                  municipal courts shall be authorized to impose penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Notwithstanding
                  any limitation of law as to penalties, which can be assessed for violations of county ordinances, any magistrate court
                  or any other court of competent jurisdiction trying cases brought as violations of this article under county
                  ordinances approved under this article shall be authorized to impose penalties for such violations not to exceed
                  $2,500.00 for each violation. Each day during which violation, failure, or refusal to comply continues shall be a
                  separate violation.

                  Sec. 30-93. - Education and certication.
                  Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspection of any landdisturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on their level of
                  involvement with the process, as developed by the commission in consultation with the division and the stakeholder
                  advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-20.
                  For each site on which land-disturbing activity occurs, each entity or person acting as either a primary, secondary, or
                  tertiary permittee, as defined in the state general permit, shall have as a minimum one person who is in responsible
                  charge of erosion and sedimentation control activities on behalf of said entity or person and meets the applicable
                  education or training certification requirements developed by the commission present on site whenever land-disturbing
                  activities are conducted on that site. A project site shall herein be defined as any land-disturbance site or multiple sites
                  within a larger common plan of development or sale permitted by an owner or operator for compliance with the state
                  general permit.
                  Persons or entities involved in projects not requiring a state general permit but otherwise requiring certified personnel
                  on site may contract with certified persons to meet the requirements of this article.
                  If a state general permittee who has operational control of land-disturbing activities for a site has met the certification
                  requirements of paragraph (1) of subsection (b) of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-19, then any person or entity involved in landdisturbing activity at that site and operating in a subcontractor capacity for such permittee shall meet those educational
                  requirements specified in paragraph (4) of subsection (b) of O.C.G.A § 12-7-19 and shall not be required to meet any
                  educational requirements that exceed those specified in said paragraph.

                  authority upon finding that the holder is not in compliance with the approved erosion, sediment and pollution control
                  plan; or that the holder is in violation of permit conditions; or that the holder is in violation of any ordinance; shall entitle
                  the person submitting the plan or holding the permit to a hearing before planning and zoning commission 45 days after
                  receipt by the local issuing authority of written notice of appeal.

                  Validity. If any section, paragraph, clause, phrase, or provision of this article shall be adjudged invalid or held
                  unconstitutional, such decisions shall not affect the remaining portions of this article.
                  Liability.
                  Neither the approval of a plan under the provisions of this article, nor the compliance with provisions of this article
                  shall relieve any person from the responsibility for damage to any person or property otherwise imposed by law nor
                  impose any liability upon the local issuing authority or district for damage to any person or property.
                  The fact that a land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another
                  shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article
                  or the terms of the permit.
                  No provision of this article shall permit any persons to violate the Georgia Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975,
                  the Georgia Water Quality Control Act or the rules and regulations promulgated and approved thereunder or
                  pollute any Waters of the State as defined thereby.

                  Sec. 32-1. - Authorization.
                  Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and O.C.G.A. § have delegated the responsibility to local governmental
                  units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the mayor and
                  council of the City of Monticello, Georgia, does ordain as follows.
                  (Ord. of 7-13-10(2), Art. 1, § A)
                  Sec. 32-2. - Findings of fact.
                  The flood hazard areas of Monticello, Georgia are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property,
                  health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for
                  flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and
                  general welfare.
                  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are
                  inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of
                  obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities.
                  (Ord. of 7-13-10(2), Art. 1, § B)
                  Sec. 32-3. - Statement of purpose.
                  It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses
                  due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
                  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood
                  damage at the time of initial construction;
                  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or
                  which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion;
                  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion, and
                  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may
                  increase flood hazards to other lands;
                  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in
                  the accommodation of floodwaters.
                  (Ord. of 7-13-10(2), Art. 1, § B)
                  Sec. 32-4. - Objectives.
                  The objectives of this chapter are:
                  To protect human life and health;
                  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer
                  lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains;
                  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a
                  manner as to minimize flood blight areas,
                  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
                  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense
                  of the general public;
                  To minimize prolonged business interruptions, and

                  Sec. 32-11. - Warning and disclaimer of liability.
                  The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific
                  and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur; flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This
                  chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding
                  or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the City of Monticello or by any officer or employee thereof for any
                  flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.

                  Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to
                  discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height.
                  Freeboard means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard
                  tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a
                  selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the
                  watershed.

                  Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, adjacent to the proposed
                  foundation of a building.
                  Historic structure means any structure that is:
                  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior)
                  or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the
                  National Register;
                  Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of
                  a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered historic
                  district;
                  Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places and determined as eligible by states with historic
                  preservation programs which have been approved by the Secretary of the Interior; or
                  Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places and determined as eligible by communities with historic
                  preservation programs that have been certified either:
                  By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior; or
                  Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs.
                  Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement. An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure,
                  used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage, in an area other than a basement, is not considered a building's lowest
                  floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of other provisions of this code.
                  Manufactured home means a building, transportable in one or more sections, built on a permanent chassis and designed to be
                  used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term also includes park trailers, travel
                  trailers, and similar transportable structures placed on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer and intended to be improved property.
                  Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured
                  home lots for rent or sale.
                  Mean sea level means the average height of the sea for all stages of the tide. It is used as a reference for establishing various
                  elevations within the floodplain. For purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of
                  1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are referenced.
                  National geodetic vertical datum (NGVD) as corrected in 1929 is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying
                  elevations within the floodplain.
                  New construction means, for the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the start of construction
                  commenced after June 18, 2010 and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes,
                  new construction means structures for which the start of construction commenced after July 11, 1994 and includes any subsequent
                  improvements to such structures.
                  New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of
                  facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities,
                  the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed after July 11, 1994.
                  North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) has replaced the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 in existing and future FEMA flood
                  modernization maps.
                  Recreational vehicle means a vehicle, which is:
                  Built on a single chassis;
                  400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection;
                  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and
                  5/31/2019 Monticello, GA Code of Ordinances
                  122/226
                  (4) Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping,
                  travel, or seasonal use.
                  Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair,
                  reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent
                  construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond
                  the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not
                  include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor
                  does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
                  installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units
                  or part of the main structure. (NOTE: accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance requirements.) For a substantial
                  improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
                  whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank.
                  Subdivision means the division of a single lot into two or more lots for the purpose of sale or development.
                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before
                  damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
                  Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place
                  during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the
                  start of construction of the improvement. NOTE: The market value of the structure should be (1) the appraised value of the structure
                  prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage
                  occurring. This term includes structures, which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual amount of repair work
                  performed.
                  For the purposes of this definition, substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall,
                  ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external
                  dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include (1) those improvements of a structure required to comply
                  with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure
                  safe living conditions and which have been identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an
                  improvement or repair project, or (2) any alteration of a historic structure provided that the alteration will not preclude the
                  structure's continued designation as a historic structure.
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or
                  improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the
                  repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced.
                  Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by
                  this chapter.
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management
                  regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance
                  required by this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  Sec. 32-32. - Permit procedures.
                  Application for a development permit shall be made to the zoning administrator on forms furnished by the community
                  prior to any development activities, and may include, but not be limited to the following: plans in duplicate drawn to scale
                  showing the elevations of the area in question and the nature, location, dimensions, of existing or proposed structures,
                  earthen fill placement, storage of materials or equipment, and drainage facilities.
                  Specifically, the following information is required:
                  Application stage.
                  Elevation in relation to mean sea level (or highest adjacent grade) of the lowest floor, including basement, of all
                  proposed structures;
                  Elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any non-residential structure will be flood-proofed;
                  Design certification from a registered professional engineer or architect that any proposed non-residential
                  flood-proofed structure will meet the flood-proofing criteria of subsection 32-52(2);
                  Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of a proposed
                  development; and
                  Construction stage. For all new construction and substantial improvements, the permit holder shall provide to the
                  administrator an as-built certification of the regulatory floor elevation or flood-proofing level immediately after the
                  lowest floor or flood proofing is completed. Any lowest floor certification made relative to mean sea level shall be
                  prepared by or under the direct supervision of a registered land surveyor or professional engineer and certified by
                  same. When flood proofing is utilized for non-residential structures, said certification shall be prepared by or under
                  the direct supervision of a professional engineer or architect and certified by same.
                  Any work undertaken prior to submission of these certifications shall be at the permit holder's risk.
                  The zoning administrator shall review the above referenced certification data submitted. Deficiencies detected by
                  such review shall be corrected by the permit holder immediately and prior to further progressive work being
                  allowed to proceed. Failure to submit certification or failure to make said corrections required hereby, shall be
                  cause to issue a stop-work order for the project.

                  Duties of the zoning administrator shall include, but shall not be limited to:
                  Review proposed development to assure that the permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied.
                  Review proposed development to assure that all necessary permits have been received from governmental agencies
                  from which approval is required by federal or state law, including section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control
                  Act Amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C. 1334. Require that copies of such permits be provided and maintained on file.
                  Review all permit applications to determine whether proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding.
                  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 32-6, then the
                  zoning administrator shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data
                  available from a federal, state or other sources in order to administer the provisions of Article III of this chapter.
                  Review and record the actual elevation in relation to mean sea level (or highest adjacent grade) of the lowest floor,
                  including basement, of all new or substantially improved structures in accordance with subsection 32-32(b)(2).

                  of a watercourse and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
                  For any altered or relocated watercourse, submit engineering data/analysis within six months to the FEMA to ensure
                  accuracy of community flood maps through the letter of map revision process. Assure flood carrying capacity of any
                  altered or relocated watercourse is maintained.
                  Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard (for
                  example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions) the zoning
                  administrator shall make the necessary interpretation. Any person contesting the location of the boundary shall be
                  given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in this chapter.
                  All records pertaining to the provisions of this chapter shall be maintained in the office of the zoning administrator
                  and shall be open for public inspection.

                  ARTICLE III. - PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION
                  Sec. 32-51. - General standards.
                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required:
                  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be anchored to prevent flotation,
                  collapse or lateral movement of the structure;
                  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed with materials and
                  utility equipment resistant to flood damage;
                  New construction or substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed by methods and practices
                  that minimize flood damage;
                  Elevated buildings. All new construction or substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully
                  enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as
                  to be an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood
                  forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater.
                  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or
                  meet the following minimum criteria:
                  Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every
                  square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;
                  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and
                  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they
                  permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both direction.
                  So as not to violate the "lowest floor" criteria of this chapter, the unfinished or flood resistant enclosure shall

                  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms.
                  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation,
                  plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or
                  accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding.
                  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring
                  may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in
                  addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces.
                  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters
                  into the system;
                  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood
                  waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters;
                  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination
                  from them during flooding, and
                  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure, which is not compliant with the provisions of
                  this chapter, shall be undertaken only if the non- conformity is not furthered, extended or replaced.

                  Sec. 32-52. - Specic standards.
                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required:
                  New construction and/or substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new
                  construction and/or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor,
                  including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation
                  perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic
                  forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 32-51(4),
                  "Elevated buildings."
                  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation,
                  plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one foot above the base flood elevation.
                  Non-residential construction. New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1
                  —30, AE, or AH zones, may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and
                  sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls
                  substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting
                  hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect
                  shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for
                  meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in subsection
                  32-33(6).
                  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available:
                  All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on: (1) individual lots or parcels, (2) in new
                  and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, (3) in expansions to existing
                  manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or (4) on a site in an existing manufactured home park or
                  subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must have
                  the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation.
                  Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or
                  subdivision may be elevated so that either:

                  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base fl
                  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation
                  elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade.
                  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist
                  flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (Ref. subsection 32-51(6) above)
                  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either:
                  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days.
                  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is
                  licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and
                  security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions); or
                  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "new construction," including the anchoring
                  and elevation requirements of subsections 32-52(3)a.—c., above.
                  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 32-6, are areas designated as
                  floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity flood-waters, debris or erosion potential.
                  In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without
                  increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply:
                  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other
                  development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is
                  demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering
                  practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base
                  flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification
                  thereof.
                  Only if subsection 32-52(4)a. above is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall
                  comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Article III of this chapter.

                  Sec. 32-53. - Building standards for streams without established base ood elevations and/or oodway (A-zones).
                  Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 32-6 where streams exist but no base flood data have been
                  provided (A-Zones), or where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions
                  apply:
                  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 32-6, then the
                  zoning administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and
                  floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of Article III.
                  Only if data are not available from these sources, then the following provisions (subsections 32-53(2) and (3)) shall
                  apply:
                  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the
                  stream or 20 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a
                  registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in more than a
                  one foot increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
                  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of
                  existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less
                  than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. (NOTE: Require the lowest floor to be elevated
                  one foot above the estimated base flood elevation in A-zone areas where a limited detail study has been
                  completed.) Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in
                  accordance with standards of subsection 32-51(4), "Elevated buildings."

                  Sec. 32-54. - Standards for areas of special ood hazard (zones AE) with established base ood elevations without designated oodways.
                  Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 32-6, where streams with base flood elevations are provided
                  but no floodways have been designated, (zones AE) the following provisions apply:
                  No encroachments, including fill material, new structures or substantial improvements shall be located within areas
                  of special flood hazard, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the
                  cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated
                  development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within
                  the community. The engineering certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard
                  hydraulic engineering principles.
                  New construction or substantial improvements of buildings shall be elevated or flood-proofed to elevations
                  established in accordance with section 32-52

                  Sec. 32-55. - Standards for areas of shallow ooding (AO zones).
                  Areas of special flood hazard established in section 32-6, may include designated "AO" shallow flooding areas. These areas have
                  base flood depths of one to three feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. The following provisions apply:
                  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and non-residential structures shall have the
                  lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map
                  (FIRM), above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including
                  basement, shall be elevated at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the
                  unimpeded movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 31-51(4),
                  "Elevated buildings."
                  The zoning administrator shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part
                  of the permit file.
                  New construction or the substantial improvement of a non-residential structure may be flood-proofed in lieu of
                  elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to
                  the specified FIRM flood level plus one foot, above highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to
                  the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
                  loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and
                  methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above,
                  and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and as required in subsections 32-32(b)(1)c. and
                  32-32(b)(2).
                  Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure.

                  hazards, and;
                  For subdivisions and/or developments greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is less, base flood elevation data shall
                  be provided for subdivision and all other proposed development, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions.
                  Any changes or revisions to the flood data adopted herein and shown on the FIRM shall be submitted to FEMA for review
                  as a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) or conditional letter of map amendment (CLOMA), whichever is
                  applicable. Upon completion of the project, the developer is responsible for submitting the "as-built" data to FEMA in
                  order to obtain the final LOMR.

                  Sec. 32-71. - Appeals and variances.
                  The planning and zoning commission as established by the mayor and council of the City of Monticello shall hear and
                  decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this chapter.
                  The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is
                  made by the zoning administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter.
                  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the planning and zoning commission may appeal such decision to the Superior
                  Court of Jasper County, Georgia, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1.
                  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed
                  repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is
                  the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
                  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the
                  criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that
                  minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.
                  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood
                  discharge would result.
                  In reviewing such requests, the planning and zoning commission shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors,
                  and all standards specified in this and other sections of this chapter.
                  Conditions for variances:
                  A variance shall be issued only when there is:
                  A finding of good and sufficient cause;
                  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and
                  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to
                  public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or
                  conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
                  The provisions of this chapter are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the

                  (4)
                  (i)
                  standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the
                  minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an Historic Structure, a
                  determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of
                  the building.
                  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the
                  base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will
                  be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.
                  The zoning administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal
                  Emergency Management Agency upon request.
                  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this chapter, the planning and zoning commission
                  may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

                  attention of the occupant shall constitute legal notification to the owner and occupant under this article.
                  Recommendations on proposed designations. A recommendation to affirm, modify or withdraw the proposed ordinance
                  for designation shall be made by the commission within 15 days following the public hearing and shall be in the form of a

                  the ordinance for designation, including the local historical organization.

                  The commission shall issue certificates of appropriateness to new structures constructed within designated historic districts if these
                  structures conform in design, scale, building materials, setback, and landscaping to the character of the district specified in the design
                  criteria developed by the commission.

                  significance and value of the historic property or the historic district. In making this determination, the commission shall

                  style, general design, arrangement, texture and material of the architectural features involved, and the relationship

                  resubmit the application at any time after doing so.
                  In cases where the application covers a material change in the appearance of a structure which would require the
                  issuance of a building permit, the rejection of the application for a certificate of appropriateness by the commission shall
                  be binding upon the building inspector or other administrative officer charged with issuing building permits and, in such
                  a case, no building permit shall be issued.

                  difficulty or undue hardship upon any owner of a specific property, the commission, in passing upon applications, shall have the power
                  to vary or modify strict adherence to the provisions, or to interpret the meaning of the provisions, so as to relieve such difficulty or
                  hardship, provided such variances, modifications, or interpretations shall remain in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the
                  provisions, so that the architectural or historical integrity, or character of the property, shall be conserved and substantial justice done.
                  In granting variances, the commission may impose such reasonable and additional stipulations and conditions as will, in its judgment,
                  best fulfill the purpose of this article. An undue hardship shall not be a situation of the person's own making.

                  All work performed pursuant to an issued certificate of appropriateness shall conform to the requirements of such
                  certificate. If work is not performed in accordance with such certificate, the commission shall issue a cease and desist
                  order, and all work shall cease.
                  The city council or the commission shall be authorized to institute any appropriate action or proceeding in a court of

                  after the issuance of the determination pursuant to section 34-94(a) or, in the case of failure of the commission to act, within 15 days of
                  expiration of the 45-day period allowed for commission action, section 34-94(a). The city council may approve, modify, or reject the
                  determination made by the commission, if the city council finds that the commission abused its discretion in reaching its decision.
                  Appeals from decisions of the city council may be taken to county superior court in the manner provided by law for appeals from
                  conviction for city ordinance violations.

                  Editor's note— Ord. No. 01-05-08-1, §§ 1—17, adopted May 8, 2001, did not specifically amend the Code. Hence its inclusion herein
                  as sections 38-51—38-67 was at the discretion of the editor.
                  Sec. 38-51. - Purpose and ndings.
                  The city's population has grown substantially in recent years. With the increase in population has come a drastic and
                  dramatic increase in the volume of traffic in the city. Uniform regulations of signage providing directional, commercial,
                  and non-commercial information to the monitoring public, to promote public safety, is essential.
                  Various and diverse businesses are located within the city. The need to advertise products and services must be balanced
                  by the city's obligation to restrict clutter, maintain an aesthetically pleasing environment, protect property values, and
                  enhance public safety.
                  Regulation of the location, size, placement, and certain features of signs is necessary to enable the public to locate goods,
                  services, and facilities in the city without difficulty and confusion, to improve the general attractiveness of the community,
                  to take advantage of the beauty of the community's natural environment, and to protect property values therein. Such
                  regulation is also necessary to facilitate and aid in the identification and location of businesses in the city in the event of
                  police, fire, or other emergencies and to avoid confusion and delay in response to such emergencies. Accordingly, it is the
                  intention of the city to establish regulations governing the display of signs which will:
                  Promote and protect the public health, safety and general welfare.
                  Enhance the economy and the business and industry of the city promoting the reasonable, orderly and effective
                  display of signs.
                  Restrict signs and lights which increase clutter or which increase the probability of traffic accidents by obstructing
                  vision.
                  Promote signs which are compatible with their surroundings.
                  Maintain the historical image of the city.
                  Ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign regulations.
                  It is also the purpose of this article to insure proper maintenance, for safety and structural soundness, as well as the
                  appearance and attractiveness of signs.

                  certified mail, return receipt requested, to the address on the permit application on or before the 30th business day after the city's
                  receipt of the completed application. If mailed, notice shall be deemed to have been given upon the date of mailing in conformity with
                  this section. If the city fails to act within the 30 day period, the permit shall be deemed to have been granted.
                  (Ord. No. 01-05-08-1, § 5, 5-8-01)
                  Sec. 38-56. - Denial and revocation.
                  Procedure. The city shall deny permits to applicants that submit applications for signs that do not comply with the
                  provisions of this article, incomplete applications, and applications containing any false material statements. Violation of
                  any provision of this article will be grounds for terminating a permit granted by the city for the erection of a sign. Should
                  it be determined that a sign permit was issued pursuant to an incomplete application or an application containing a false
                  material statement, or that a permit has been erroneously issued in violation of this article, the clerk shall revoke the
                  permit. Should the city deny a permit, the reasons for the denial are to be stated in writing and mailed by certified mail,
                  return receipt requested, to the address on the permit application on or before the 30th business day after the city's
                  receipt of the application. Any application denied and later resubmitted shall be deemed to have been submitted on the
                  date of re-submission, instead of the date of the original submission. No permit shall be denied or revoked except for
                  due cause as hereinafter defined, and the applicant is granted a public hearing before a hearing officer designated by the
                  city. The applicant will be given ten days written notice of the time, place and purpose of the hearing, with a statement of
                  the reason for the denial of the permit application, or the revocation of a permit. "Due cause" is the violation of the
                  provisions of this article, state or federal law, or the submission of an incomplete application or an application containing
                  false material statements.
                  Appeal. An individual whose permit application has been denied or a permittee whose permit has been revoked may
                  appeal the decision of the hearing officer, to the city council provided that they file written notice of an appeal with the
                  city clerk within ten business days of the hearing officer's decision. Such appeal shall be considered by the council at the
                  next city council meeting held after the city's receipt of the written notice of appeal, provided that notice of appeal is
                  received a minimum of two full business days before the meeting.
                  In the event an individual whose permit has been denied or revoked is dissatisfied with the decision of the city council,
                  they may petition for writ of certiorari to the superior court as provided by law.

                  Sec. 38-57. - Permit expiration.
                  A sign permit shall become null and void if the sign for which the permit was issued has not been completed and installed within six
                  months after the date of issuance. No refunds will be made for permit fees paid for permits that expired due to failure to erect a
                  permitted sign. If later an individual desires to erect a sign at the same location, a new application must be processed and other fee paid
                  in accordance with the fee schedule applicable at such time.

                  Where a literal application of the terms of this article, due to special circumstances, would result in an unusual hardship in an
                  individual case, a variance may be granted where all the following conditions exist:
                  Exceptional conditions pertaining to the property where the sign is to be located as a result of its size, shape, or
                  topography, which are not applicable to other lands or structures in the area.
                  The applicant would be deprived of rights that are commonly enjoyed by others similarly situated.
                  Granting the variance would not confer on the applicant any significant privileges which are denied to others
                  similarly situated.
                  The exceptional circumstances are not the result of action by the applicant.
                  The requested variance is the minimum variance necessary to allow the applicant to enjoy the rights commonly
                  enjoyed by others similarly situated.
                  Granting of the variance would not violate more than one standard of this article.
                  Granting the variance would not result in allowing a sign that interferes with road of highway visibility or obstruct or
                  otherwise interfere with the safe and orderly movement of traffic.

                  Sec. 54-1. - Rules of the road; misdemeanor oenses.
                  Georgia Rules of the Road adopted.
                  Intent. The purpose of this section is to regulate traffic upon the public streets of the City and address ordinance
                  violations and misdemeanor offenses over which municipal courts of Georgia have jurisdiction, and to repeal all
                  other ordinances and regulations in conflict herewith.
                  Incorporation by reference.
                  The municipal court has the right and power to conduct trials, receive pleas of guilty, and impose sentence, in
                  the manner required by law, upon defendants violating any and all criminal laws of this state relating to traffic
                  upon the public roads, streets, and highways of this state where the penalty for the offense does not exceed
                  that of the grade of misdemeanor, and notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, the municipal
                  court is granted jurisdiction to try and dispose of misdemeanor traffic offenses arising under state law except
                  violations of O.C.G.A. § 40-6-393 and to impose any punishment authorized for such offenses under general
                  state law, if the defendant waives a jury trial, per O.C.G.A. § 40-13-21. Per Chapter 6 of Title 40 of O.C.G.A.,
                  Sections 40-6-372 through 40-6-376, and Sections 40-6-1 to 40-6-395 of that chapter known as the Uniform
                  Rules of the Road, and the definitions contained in O.C.G.A. § 40-1-1, are hereby adopted as and for the traffic
                  regulations of the city with like effect as if recited herein.
                  The municipal court has jurisdiction as provided by law over not only the foregoing and the ordinances
                  promulgated by the City, but also over state statutes and county ordinances per the 1983 Constitution, Article
                  VI, Section 1, Paragraph 1, which vests municipal courts with jurisdiction over various state misdemeanor
                  offenses. In regard to matters of local concern the legislature has, through an express delegation of legislative
                  authority, vested municipalities with power to enact municipal ordinances on the same subject matters as
                  those covered by state criminal laws. State law and this provision grants to the municipal court the jurisdiction
                  to try and dispose of cases where a person is charged with the possession of one ounce or less of marijuana
                  (see O.C.G.A. § 36-32-6), where a person is charged with a misdemeanor under O.C.G.A. § 40-6-10 of knowingly
                  operating or knowingly authorizing the operation of a motor vehicle within the corporate limits of the
                  municipality without effective insurance of such vehicle or without an approved plan of self-insurance (see
                  O.C.G.A. § 36-32-7), cases in which a person is charged with a misdemeanor under O.C.G.A. § 12-9-55 of
                  operating a responsible motor vehicle within the corporate limits of the municipality without a certificate of
                  emission inspection (see O.C.G.A. § 36-32-8), cases in which a person is charged with a first, second, or third
                  offense of theft by shoplifting when the property which was the subject of the theft was valued at $300.00 or
                  less (see O.C.G.A. § 36-32-9), cases of a first offense violation of O.C.G.A. § 3-3-23, relating to furnishing

                  O.C.G.A. § 36-32-10.1).
                  The municipal court can also hear misdemeanor violations of the following laws of the State of Georgia—public
                  intoxication, disorderly conduct, violation of Georgia Controlled Substances Act—possession of less than one
                  ounce of marijuana; violations of probated sentences by subjects sentenced to probation by this court.
                  The municipal court may only hear cases brought against adults, ages 17 and over. Not all ordinance cases that
                  are heard in municipal court are strictly criminal. The municipal court does have jurisdiction over public
                  nuisance violations under O.C.G.A. § 41-2-5.
                  Otherwise, the municipal court is without jurisdiction to try state law offenses, except to the extent the city has
                  lawfully enacted an ordinance tracking the state law verbiage. The municipal court is expressly authorized to
                  hear cases wherein the city has lawfully enacted an ordinance tracking the state law verbiage.
                  Penalties. Unless another penalty is expressly provided by law, every person convicted of a violation of any provision of
                  this section shall be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000.00 or by imprisonment of not more than six months or
                  by both such fine and imprisonment.

                  City park means any area within the city limits of the city designated and used as a public park by the citizens of the city.
                  Motorized vehicles means any motor driven vehicle, including off-road vehicles as defined by state law.
                  Prohibited action. No motorized vehicles shall be allowed in the city parks between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 6:30 a.m.,
                  without the express permission of the city council.
                  Penalty. Any person violating the provisions of this section shall be punished upon conviction as provided in section 1-12.
                  The city police shall also have the option to impound such motorized vehicle, to be held until sufficient bond is posted.
                  (Ord. of 7-15-96, §§ I—III)
                  Sec. 54-3. - Operation of commercial motor vehicles by city employees.
                  The city council, hereinafter referred to as the "council," places a high priority on ensuring the safe operations of
                  commercial motor vehicles (CMVs) by city employees. The council recognizes that unimpaired judgement on the part of
                  its drivers is essential to providing safe operation of commercial motor vehicles (CMVs), and that alcoholic misuse and
                  controlled substance use may impair the judgement of drivers.
                  In order to prevent accidents and injuries resulting from alcohol misuse and controlled substance use, the council hereby
                  implements all federal and state law and regulations regarding individuals who drive or may drive a commercial motor
                  vehicle (CMV) for the city, at any time, including but not limited to full-time employees, part-time employees and others.
                  All city employees who drive or may drive a commercial motor vehicle (CMV) for the city must participate in the controlled
                  substance and alcohol testing program as more fully described in applicable federal and state law and regulations;
                  specifically: Federal Highway Administration, DOT-Part 382—Controlled Substances and Alcohol Use and Testing, and Part
                  40—Procedures for Transportation Workplace Drug Testing Programs.
                  Individuals who have positive controlled substance test results shall be terminated. Individuals whose test results reveal
                  blood alcohol concentrations 0.04 and above and individuals who refuse to submit to a required alcohol or controlled
                  substance test shall be terminated. Individuals whose test results reveal blood alcohol concentrations of at least 0.02, but

                  be terminated.
                  Where applicable, drivers must inform their immediate supervisor of any therapeutic drug use, whether by prescription
                  or "over the counter," and must provide a statement from their treating physician that the substance does not adversely
                  affect the driver's ability to operate the commercial motor vehicle (CMV).

                  provisions of this article, and the use of specifically identified streets pursuant to all previously granted revocable
                  licenses shall thereafter be pursuant to and in accordance with any such franchise that may be granted.

                  FOOTNOTE(S):
                  Editor's note— Ord. No. 01-10-9-1, Arts. I—XI, adopted Oct. 9, 2001, did not specifically amend the Code; hence, inclusion herein as
                  Art. III, §§ 56-66—56-79 was at the discretion of the editor. Also see the Code Comparative Table.
                  Sec. 56-66. - Purpose.
                  This article is designed and intended to balance the interest of the residents of the city, telecommunications providers, and
                  telecommunications customers in the siting of telecommunications facilities within the corporate limits of the city so as to protect the
                  health, safety, and integrity of residential neighborhoods; and to foster through appropriate zoning and land use controls, a competitive
                  environment for telecommunications carriers that does not unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent
                  personal wireless services. This article shall not prohibit, or have the effect of prohibiting, the provision of personal wireless services.
                  This article is intended to promote the city as a proactive city in the availability of personal wireless telecommunications service. To that
                  end, this article shall:
                  Provide for the appropriate location and development of telecommunications facilities within the city limits of the
                  city;
                  Protect the city's built and natural environment by promoting compatible design standards for telecommunications
                  facilities;
                  Minimize adverse visual impacts of telecommunications facilities through careful design, siting, landscape screening
                  and innovative camouflaging techniques;
                  Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower or antennas failure through engineering and careful
                  siting of telecommunications tower structures and antennas;
                  Maximize use of any new and existing telecommunications towers through co-location so as to minimize the need
                  to construct new towers and minimize the total number of towers throughout the city;
                  Maximize and encourage use of alternate telecommunication tower structures as a primary option rather than
                  construction of additional single-use towers;
                  Encourage and promote the location of new telecommunications activities in areas which are not zoned for
                  residential use.

                  Sec. 56-68. - Applicability.
                  District height limitations. The requirements set forth in this article shall govern the location of towers that exceed, and
                  antennas that are installed at a height in excess of 75 feet. The height limitations applicable to buildings and structures
                  shall not apply to towers and antennas.
                  Amateur radio and receive-only antennas. This article shall not govern any tower, or the installation of any antenna, that
                  is under 70 feet in height and is owned and operated by a federally-licensed amateur radio station operator or is used
                  exclusively for receive only antennas.
                  Pre-existing towers and antennas . Any tower or antenna for which a permit has been properly issued prior to the
                  effective date of this article shall not be required to meet the requirements of this article, other than the requirements of
                  subsection 56-69(3) and (4). Any such towers or antennas shall be referred to in this article as "preexisting antennas."

                  Sec. 56-69. - Standards applicable to all towers and antennas.
                  The city zoning ordinance permits towers by special exception in all zoning districts. No towers or antenna shall be located in the
                  city except as set forth in this article. The following standards shall apply to all towers and antennas, unless the governing authority
                  reduces the standards if the goals of this article would be better served thereby.
                  Principal use. Antennas and towers are considered a principal use permitted by special exception in all zoning
                  districts. A different principal use, as defined by the city zoning ordinance, existing on the same lot shall preclude
                  the installation of an antenna or tower on such lot. For purposes of determining whether the installation of a tower
                  or antenna complies with district development regulations, including, but not limited to set-back requirements, lot
                  coverage requirements, and any other such requirements, the dimensions of the portion of the tract dedicated to
                  the tower shall control, even though the antennas or towers may be located on leased parcels within such tracts.
                  Aesthetics; lighting. The guidelines set forth in this paragraph shall govern the location of all towers, and the
                  installation of all antennas, governed by this article; provided, however, that the governing authority may waive
                  these requirements if it determines that the goals of this article are better served thereby. The determination shall
                  be within the discretion of the city council. This list is not an exclusive list of the aesthetic issues the governing
                  authority may consider; these are merely guidelines. The governing authority may consider any factor that serves
                  the goals and purposes of this article.
                  Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, be
                  painted a neutral color, as to reduce visual obtrusiveness.
                  At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures shall use materials, color, textures, screening,
                  and landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and built environment.
                  If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and
                  mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of
                  the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible.
                  Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the FAA or other applicable authority.
                  Federal requirements. All towers must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC and
                  any other agency of the federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If such standards

                  and regulations are changed, then the owners of the towers and antennas governed by this ordinance shall bring
                  such towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six months of the
                  effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a more stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the
                  controlling federal agency. Failure to bring towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and
                  regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at the owner's expense. Any such
                  removal by the governing authority shall be in the manner provided in O.C.G.A. §§ 41-2-8 through 41-2-17.
                  Building codes; safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity of towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that
                  it is maintained in compliance with standards for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries Association,
                  as amended from time to time. If upon inspection, the governing authority concludes that a tower fails to comply
                  with such codes and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to
                  the owner of the tower, the owner shall have 30 days to bring such tower into compliance with such standards. If
                  the owner fails to bring such tower into compliance within said 30 days, the governing authority may remove such
                  tower at the owner's expense. Any such removal by the governing authority shall be in the manner provided in
                  O.C.G.A. §§ 41-2-8 through 41-2-17.
                  Site location and development shall preserve the preexisting character of the surrounding buildings and land uses
                  in the zoning district as much as possible. Personal wireless telecommunications towers shall be integrated through
                  location and design to blend in with existing characteristics of the site to the extent practical.
                  Existing on-site vegetation shall be preserved or improved, and disturbance of the existing topography shall be
                  minimized, unless such disturbance would result in less visual impact of the site to the surrounding area.
                  At a tower site, the design of the building and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors,
                  textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower and related facilities to the natural setting and built
                  environment.
                  Towers must be set back a distance equal to the height of the tower or a minimum of 200 feet from any property
                  line.
                  Guys and accessory facilities must satisfy the minimum zoning district setback requirements for front, side and rear
                  yards.
                  Towers shall not be sited where they will negatively affect historic or scenic view corridors as designated by the
                  governing authority or any state or federal law or agency or where they will create visual clutter.
                  Towers shall be enclosed by decay-resistant security fencing installed along the perimeter of the compound not less
                  than six feet in height and shall be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device or other similar protective
                  device designed to prevent tower access.
                  The following requirements shall govern the landscaping surrounding towers:
                  Tower facilities shall be landscaped with a buffer of plant materials that effectively screens the view of the
                  tower compound from adjacent properties. The standard buffer shall consist of a landscaped strip at least ten
                  feet wide outside the required fence.
                  In locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, as determined by the city council, the
                  landscaping requirement may be reduced or waived altogether.
                  Existing mature tree growth and natural land forms on the site shall be preserved to the maximum extent
                  possible. In some cases, such as towers sited on large, wooded lots, natural growth around the property
                  perimeter may provide an adequate buffer at the discretion of the city council.
                  Any tower proposed at a height greater than 100 feet, up to 120 feet shall be designed and intended to
                  accommodate at least three users. Furthermore, for every additional 20 feet of height, said tower shall be designed
                  to accommodate an additional user.

                  All telecommunications facilities shall be maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable building and technical
                  codes so as to ensure the structural integrity of such facilities. If upon inspection by an approving authority any such
                  telecommunications facility is determined not to comply with the code standards or to constitute a danger to persons or property, then
                  upon notice being provided to the owner of the facility and the owner of the property, if said owner is different, such owners shall have
                  30 days to bring such facility into compliance. In the event such telecommunications facility is not brought into compliance within 30
                  days, the city may provide notice to the owners requiring the telecommunications facility to be removed. In the event such
                  telecommunications facility is not removed within 30 days of receipt of such notice, the city may remove such facility and place a lien
                  upon the property for the costs of removal. Delay by the city in taking action shall not in any way waive the city's right to take action. The
                  city may pursue all legal remedies available to it to insure that telecommunications facilities not in compliance with the code standards
                  or which constitutes a danger to persons or property are brought into compliance or removed. The city may seek to have the
                  telecommunications facility removed regardless of the owner's or operator's intent to operate the tower or antenna and regardless of
                  any permits, federal, state or otherwise which may have been granted.

                  notice from the city notifying the owner(s) of such abandonment, the city may remove such tower and/or antenna and
                  place lien upon the property for the costs of removal. The city may pursue all legal remedies available to it to insure that
                  abandoned telecommunications facilities are removed. Delay by the city in taking action shall not in any way waive the
                  city's right to take action. The city may seek to have the telecommunications facility removed regardless of the owner's or

                  Sec. 58-28. - Use of public sewers required.
                  Sanitary disposal of wastes. It shall be unlawful for any person to place, deposit or permit to be deposited in any
                  unsanitary or unpermitted manner on public or private property, any human or animal excrement, garbage or other
                  objectionable waste.
                  Untreated sewage/other polluted waters. It shall be unlawful to discharge to any natural outlet within the city, any
                  sewage or other polluted waters, except where suitable treatment has been provided in accordance with subsequent
                  subsections of this division.

                  public sanitary sewer of the city, shall install, at his or her own expense, suitable toilet facilities therein, and shall connect
                  such facilities directly with the proper public sewer in accordance with the provisions of this division, provided that said
                  public sewer is within 200 feet of the property line.
                  (Ord. 4-13-10, § 1(Exh. A))
                  Sec. 58-29. - Sewer backup.
                  The city does not accept responsibility for blockages that may occur in lines not owned and maintained by the city,
                  including, but not limited to, sewer stubs. Stubs are defined as the connection from the structure to the city right-of-way
                  or sewer easement. All property owners should install backflow prevention devices to avoid raw sewage backflow.
                  Since most blockages occur in stubs rather than city lines, property owners should contact a plumbing company rather
                  than the city if they identify a problem with their sewer. The plumbing company and/or property owner should contact
                  the city public works department only after it has been determined that the problem appears to be in the city line. Should
                  the city use a mechanical device to remove the stoppage and determine the blockage to be in the portion of the line that
                  is the property owner's responsibility, the city reserves the right to charge the property owner for the service of removing
                  the stoppage.
                  Upon contact indicating a problem in the city owned line, a wastewater collection department crew will be dispatched to
                  determine if the blockage is in city lines and, if so, the appropriate action to eliminate the blockage. The superintendent,
                  or his designated representative, will normally make a determination as to whether the problem is/was in the city owned
                  line. If the blockage is not in the city owned line, the property owner will be responsible for correcting the problem and
                  for all damages and costs.

                  permitted to discharge to any natural outlet.
                  Public sewer required, once available. At such time as a public sewer becomes available to a property served by a private
                  sewage disposal system, as provided above, a direct connection shall be made to the public sewer in compliance with this
                  section within 60 days, and any septic tanks, cesspools and similar private sewage disposal facilities shall be abandoned,
                  cleaned of sludge, and filled with clean gravel, dirt or other suitable material.
                  Private facilities to be sanitary. The owner shall operate and maintain the private sewage disposal facilities in a sanitary
                  manner at all times, at no expense to the city.
                  County health officer. No statement contained in this division shall be construed to interfere with any additional
                  requirements that may be imposed by the health department.

                  Sec. 58-31. - Building sewers and connections.
                  Disturbance of public sewers. No person shall uncover, make any connections with or opening into, or use, alter or
                  disturb any public sewer or appurtenance thereof without first obtaining a written permit from the superintendent.
                  Building sewer permits. There shall be three classes of building sewer permits: (i) for residential, (ii) for commercial
                  service; and (iii) for service to establishments producing industrial wastes. In either case, the owner or his agent shall
                  make application on a special form furnished by the city. The permit application shall be supplemented by any plans,
                  specifications or other information considered pertinent in the judgment of the superintendent. A permit and inspection
                  fee shall be paid to the city at the time the application is filed. Permit and inspection fees shall be determined from time
                  to time by the city council and set forth in the schedule of fees and charges.
                  Owner liable for all costs. All costs and expense of the installation and connection of the sewer shall be borne by the
                  owner; including but not limited to boring under the entire road, backfilling and surface restoration of open-cut
                  installation across and in city streets, county roads, and state highways. The owner shall indemnify the city from any loss
                  or damage that may directly or indirectly be occasioned by the installation of the sewer.
                  Separate sewers required; exceptions. A separate building sewer shall be provided for every building, except where one
                  building stands at the rear of another on an interior lot and no private sewer is available or can be constructed to the
                  rear building, the sewer line from the front building may be extended to the rear building and the whole considered as
                  one building sewer.
                  Old sewers to meet requirements of section. Old building sewers may be used in connection with new buildings only
                  when they are found, on examination and testing by the superintendent, to meet all requirements of this section and
                  supporting evidence has been provided to and approved by the superintendent. Supporting evidence may include:
                  pressure testing, mandrel passing, video inspecting, and smart pigging (internal profiling) to be conducted at applicant's

                  receipt of notice by the superintendent. Any installation requiring an excavation shall remain uncovered until the
                  superintendent or authorized representative has documented an approved inspection.
                  Care of public property. All excavations shall be adequately guarded with barricades and lights so as to protect the public
                  from hazard. Streets, sidewalks, parkways, and other public property disturbed in the course of the work shall be
                  restored in a manner satisfactory to the city.

                  Any waters or wastes containing phenols or other taste or odor producing substances, in such concentrations exceedin
                  may be established by the superintendent as necessary after treatment of the composite sewage, to meet the requirem
                  state, federal or other public agencies of jurisdiction for such discharge to the receiving waters;
                  Any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-life or concentration as may exceed limits established by the
                  superintendent in compliance with applicable state or federal regulations;
                  Any waters or wastes having a pH in excess of 9.0;
                  Materials that exert or cause:
                  Unusual concentrations of inert suspended solids (including but not limited to, Fullers earth, lime slurries, and
                  lime residues) or of dissolved solids (including but not limited to, sodium chloride and sodium sulfate);
                  Excessive discoloration (including but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable tanning solutions);
                  Unusual BOD, chemical oxygen demand, or chlorine requirements in such quantities as to constitute a
                  significant load on the sewage treatment works; or
                  Unusual volume of flow or concentration of wastes constituting "slugs" as defined herein; and
                  Waters or wastes containing substances that are not amenable to treatment or reduction by the sewage treatment
                  processes employed, or are amenable to treatment only to such degree that the sewage treatment plant effluent
                  cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having jurisdiction over discharge to the receiving waters.
                  Duties and options of the superintendent. If any waters or wastes are discharged or proposed to be discharged to the
                  public sewers, which contain the substances or possess the characteristics enumerated above, and which in the
                  judgment of the superintendent, may have a deleterious effect upon the sewage works, processes, equipment or
                  receiving waters, or otherwise create a hazard to life or public welfare, or constitute a public nuisance, the
                  superintendent may:
                  Reject the wastes;
                  Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to the public sewers;
                  Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge;
                  Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and creating the wastes not covered by existing taxes or
                  sewer charges;
                  Review and possibly require changes to the design and installation of any plants and equipment used to pretreat or
                  equalize waste flows; and/or
                  Review and possibly require changes prior to the admission into the public sewers of any water or wastes having:
                  A five-day BOD greater than 300 mg/l; or
                  Containing more than 350 mg/l of suspended solids; or
                  Having an average daily flow greater than two percent of the average daily sewage flow of the city.
                  Interceptors. Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of the superintendent, they are
                  necessary for the proper handling of wastes containing grease in excessive amounts, or any flammable wastes, sand or
                  other harmful ingredients; except that such interceptors shall not be required for private living quarters or dwelling units.
                  All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by the superintendent, and shall be located as to be readily and
                  easily accessible for cleaning and inspection.
                  Preliminary treatment facilities. Where preliminary treatment or flow-equalizing facilities are provided for any waters or
                  wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operation by the owner at his expense.
                  Control manhole. When required by the superintendent, the owner of any property generating industrial wastes shall
                  install a suitable control manhole together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the building sewer to
                  facilitate observation, sampling and measurement of the wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessible and
                  safely located, and shall be constructed per plans approved by the superintendent. The manhole shall be installed by the
                  owner at his expense, and shall be maintained to be safe and accessible at all times.
                  Sampling. All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes to which reference is made in

                  this section shall be determined per the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater
                  published by the American Public Health Association, and shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon
                  suitable samples taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been required, the control
                  manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the
                  building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of
                  constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb and property. The particular
                  analyses involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a
                  grab sample or samples should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are obtained
                  from 24-hour composites of all outfalls, whereas pH levels are determined from periodic grab samples.
                  Industrial agreements. No statement in this section shall be construed as preventing any special agreement or
                  arrangement between the city and any industry where waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by the
                  city for treatment, subject to payment by the industry.

                  Limitations of authority. The superintendent or his representatives shall have no authority to inquire into any processes
                  including metallurgical, chemical, oil, refining, ceramic, paper or other industries beyond that point having a direct
                  bearing on the kind and source of discharge to the sewers or waterways or facilities for waste treatment.
                  Indemnity. While performing the necessary work on private properties referred to above, the superintendent or duly
                  authorized employees of the city shall observe all safety rules applicable to the premises established by the company and
                  the company shall be held harmless for injury or death to the city employees and against liability claims and demands for
                  personal injury or property damage asserted against the company and growing out of the gauging and sampling
                  operation, except as such may be caused by negligence or failure of the company to maintain safe conditions as required
                  above.
                  Easements. The superintendent and other duly authorized employees of the city bearing proper credentials and
                  identification shall be permitted to enter all private properties through which the city holds a duly negotiated easement
                  for the purposes of, but not limited to, inspection, observation, measurement, sampling, repair and maintenance of any
                  portion of the sewage works within said easement. All entry and subsequent work, if any, on said easement, shall be
                  done in full accordance with the terms of the duly negotiated easement pertaining to the private property.

                  Sec. 58-95. - Identify theft prevention program.
                  Short title. This section shall be known as the identify theft prevention program.
                  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to comply with 16 CFR § 681.2 to detect, prevent and mitigate identity theft by
                  identifying and detecting identity theft red flags and by responding to such red flags in a manner that will prevent identity
                  theft.
                  Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:
                  Covered account means (i) An account that a financial institution or creditor offers or maintains, primarily for personal, family,
                  or household purposes, that involves or is designed to permit multiple payments or transactions, such as a credit card account,
                  mortgage loan, automobile loan, margin account, cell phone account, utility account, checking account, or savings account; and (ii)
                  Any other account that the financial institution or creditor offers or maintains for which there is a reasonably foreseeable risk to
                  customers or to the safety and soundness of the financial institution or creditor from identity theft, including financial, operational,
                  compliance, reputation, or litigation risks.
                  Credit means the right granted by a creditor to a debtor to defer payment of debt or to incur debts and defer its payment or to
                  purchase property or services and defer payment therefor.
                  Creditor means any person who regularly extends, renews, or continues credit; any person who regularly arranges for the
                  extension, renewal, or continuation of credit; or any assignee of an original creditor who participates in the decision to extend,
                  renew, or continue credit and includes utility companies and telecommunications companies.
                  Customer means a person that has a covered account with a creditor.
                  Identity theft means a fraud committed or attempted using identifying information of another person without authority.
                  Person means a natural person, a corporation, government or governmental subdivision or agency, trust, estate, partnership,
                  cooperative, or association.
                  Personal identifying information means a person's credit card account information, debit card information bank account
                  information and drivers' license information and for a natural person includes their social security number, mother's birth name,
                  and date of birth.
                  Red flag means a pattern, practice, or specific activity that indicates the possible existence of identity theft.
                  Service provider means a person that provides a service directly to the city.
                  Findings. The city is a creditor pursuant to 16 CFR § 681.2 due to its provision or maintenance of covered accounts for
                  which payment is made in arrears. Covered accounts offered to customers for the provision of city services include utility
                  accounts. The city has little or no previous experience with identity theft related to covered accounts. The processes of
                  opening a new covered account, restoring an existing covered account, and making payments on such accounts have
                  been identified as potential processes in which identity theft could occur. The city limits access to personal identifying
                  information to those employees responsible for or otherwise involved in opening or restoring covered accounts or
                  accepting payment for use of covered accounts. Information provided to such employees is entered directly into the city's
                  computer system and is not otherwise recorded. There is a risk of identity theft occurring in the following ways: use by an
                  applicant of another person's personal identifying information to establish a new covered account; use of a previous
                  customer's personal identifying information by another person in an effort to have service restored in the previous

                  (2)
                  (3)
                  customer's name; use of another person's credit card, bank account, or other method of payment by a customer to pay
                  such customer's covered account or accounts; and use by a customer desiring to restore such customer's covered
                  account of another person's credit card, bank account, or other method of payment.
                  Process of establishing a covered account. As a precondition to opening a covered account in the city, each applicant shall
                  provide the city with personal identifying information of the customer, for example, a valid government issued
                  identification card containing a photograph of the customer or, for customers who are not natural persons, a photograph
                  of the customer's agent opening the account. Such applicant shall also provide any information necessary for the
                  department providing the service for which the covered account is created to access the applicant's consumer credit
                  report. Such information shall be entered directly into the city's computer system and shall not otherwise be recorded.
                  Each account shall be assigned an account number and may be assigned a personal identification number (PIN) which
                  shall be unique to that account. The city may utilize computer software to randomly generate assigned PINs and to
                  encrypt account numbers and PINs.
                  Access to covered account information. Access to customer accounts shall be password protected and shall be limited to
                  authorized city personnel. Such password(s) shall be changed on a regular basis, shall be at least eight characters in
                  length and shall contain letters, numbers and symbols. Any unauthorized access to or other breach of customer accounts
                  is to be reported immediately to the city clerk/treasurer and the password changed immediately. Personal identifying
                  information included in customer accounts is considered confidential and any request or demand for such information
                  shall be immediately forwarded to the city clerk/treasurer and the city attorney.
                  Credit card payments. If credit card payments that are made over the internet are processed through a third party service
                  provider, such third party service provider shall certify that it has an adequate identity theft prevention program in place
                  that is applicable to such payments. All credit card payments made over the telephone or the city's website shall be
                  entered directly into the customer's account information in the computer data base. Account statements and receipts for
                  covered accounts shall include only the last four digits of the credit or debit card or the bank account used for payment
                  of the covered account.
                  Sources and types of red flags. All employees responsible for or involved in the process of opening a covered account,
                  restoring a covered account or accepting payment for a covered account shall check for red flags as indicators of possible
                  identity theft and such red flags may include:
                  Alerts from consumer reporting agencies, fraud detection agencies or service providers. Examples of alerts include
                  but are not limited to: a fraud or active duty alert that is included with a consumer report; a notice of credit freeze in
                  response to a request for a consumer report; a notice of address discrepancy provided by a consumer reporting
                  agency; indications of a pattern of activity in a consumer report that is inconsistent with the history and usual
                  pattern of activity of an applicant or customer, such as: a recent and significant increase in the volume of inquiries;
                  an unusual number of recently established credit relationships; a material change in the use of credit, especially
                  with respect to recently established credit relationships; or an account that was closed for cause or identified for
                  abuse of account privileges by a financial institution or creditor.
                  Suspicious documents. Examples of suspicious documents include: documents provided for identification that
                  appear to be altered or forged; identification on which the photograph or physical description is inconsistent with
                  the appearance of the applicant or customer; identification on which the information is inconsistent with
                  information provided by the applicant or customer; identification on which the information is inconsistent with
                  readily accessible information that is on file with the financial institution or creditor, such as a signature card or a
                  recent check; or an application that appears to have been altered or forged, or appears to have been destroyed and
                  reassembled.
                  Suspicious personal identification, such as suspicious address change. Examples of suspicious identifying
                  information include: personal identifying information that is inconsistent with external information sources used by
                  the financial institution or creditor. For example: The address does not match any address in the consumer report;
                  or the Social Security Number (SSN) has not been issued, or is listed on the Social Security Administration's Death
                  Master File. Personal identifying information provided by the customer is not consistent with other personal
                  5/31/2019 Monticello, GA Code of Ordinances
                  191/226

                  (5)
                  (i)
                  identifying information provided by the customer, such as a lack of correlation between the SSN range and date of
                  birth. Personal identifying information or a phone number or address, is associated with known fraudulent
                  applications or activities as indicated by internal or third-party sources used by the financial institution or creditor.
                  Other information provided, such as fictitious mailing address, mail drop addresses, jail addresses, invalid phone
                  numbers, pager numbers or answering services, is associated with fraudulent activity. The SSN provided is the same
                  as that submitted by other applicants or customers. The address or telephone number provided is the same as or
                  similar to the account number or telephone number submitted by an unusually large number of applicants or
                  customers. The applicant or customer fails to provide all required personal identifying information on an application
                  or in response to notification that the application is incomplete. Personal identifying information is not consistent
                  with personal identifying information that is on file with the financial institution or creditor. The applicant or
                  customer cannot provide authenticating information beyond that which generally would be available from a wallet
                  or consumer report.
                  Unusual use of or suspicious activity relating to a covered account. Examples of suspicious activity include: shortly
                  following the notice of a change of address for an account, city receives a request for the addition of authorized
                  users on the account. A new revolving credit account is used in a manner commonly associated with known patterns
                  of fraud patterns. For example: The customer fails to make the first payment or makes an initial payment but no
                  subsequent payments. An account is used in a manner that is not consistent with established patterns of activity on
                  the account. There is, for example: nonpayment when there is no history of late or missed payments; a material
                  change in purchasing or spending patterns; an account that has been inactive for a long period of time is used
                  (taking into consideration the type of account, the expected pattern of usage and other relevant factors). Mail sent
                  to the customer is returned repeatedly as undeliverable although transactions continue to be conducted in
                  connection with the customer's account. The city is notified that the customer is not receiving paper account
                  statements. The city is notified of unauthorized charges or transactions in connection with a customer's account.
                  The city is notified by a customer, law enforcement or another person that it has opened a fraudulent account for a
                  person engaged in identity theft.
                  Notice from customers, law enforcement, victims or other reliable sources regarding possible identity theft or
                  phishing relating to covered accounts.
                  Prevention and mitigation of identity theft for existing accounts. In the event that any city employee responsible for or
                  involved in restoring an existing covered account or accepting payment for a covered account becomes aware of red flags
                  indicating possible identity theft with respect to existing covered accounts, such employee shall use his or her discretion
                  to determine whether such red flag or combination of red flags suggests a threat of identity theft. If, in his or her
                  discretion, such employee determines that identity theft or attempted identity theft is likely or probable, such employee
                  shall immediately report such red flags to the city clerk/treasurer. If, in his or her discretion, such employee deems that
                  identity theft is unlikely or that reliable information is available to reconcile red flags, the employee shall convey this
                  information to the city clerk/treasurer, who may in his or her discretion determine that no further action is necessary. If
                  the city clerk/treasurer in his or her discretion determines that further action is necessary, a city employee shall perform
                  one or more of the following responses, as determined to be appropriate by the city clerk/treasurer:
                  Contact the customer if, after contacting the customer, it is apparent that someone other than the customer has accessed
                  the customer's covered account: change any account numbers, passwords, security codes, or other security devices that
                  permit access to an account or close the account; cease attempts to collect additional charges from the customer and
                  decline to sell the customer's account to a debt collector in the event that the customer's account has been accessed
                  without authorization and such access has caused additional charges to accrue; notify a debt collector within three working
                  days of the discovery of likely or probable identity theft relating to a customer account that has been sold to such debt
                  collector in the event that a customer's account has been sold to a debt collector prior to the discovery of the likelihood or
                  probability of identity theft relating to such account; notify law enforcement, in the event that someone other than the
                  customer has accessed the customer's account causing additional charges to accrue or accessing personal identifying
                  information; or take other appropriate action to prevent or mitigate identity theft.

                  Prevention and mitigation of identity theft for new accounts. In the event that any city employee responsible for or involved
                  a new covered account becomes aware of red flags indicating possible identity theft with respect an application for a new ac
                  such employee shall use his or her discretion to determine whether such red flag or combination of red flags suggests a thre
                  identity theft. If, in his or her discretion, such employee determines that identity theft or attempted identity theft is likely or
                  such employee shall immediately report such red flags to the city clerk/treasurer. If, in his or her discretion, such employee
                  identity theft is unlikely or that reliable information is available to reconcile red flags, the employee shall convey this informa
                  city clerk/treasurer, who may in his or her discretion determine that no further action is necessary. If the city clerk/treasurer
                  her discretion determines that further action is necessary, a city employee shall perform one or more of the following respo
                  determined to be appropriate by the city clerk/treasurer: request additional identifying information from the applicant; deny
                  application for the new account; notify law enforcement of possible identity theft; or take other appropriate action to preven
                  mitigate identity theft.
                  Updating the program. The city council shall periodically review and, as deemed necessary by the council, update the
                  identity theft prevention program along with any relevant red flags in order to reflect changes in risks to customers or to
                  the safety and soundness of the city and its covered accounts from identity theft. In so doing, the city council shall
                  consider the following factors and exercise its discretion in amending the program: The city's experiences with identity
                  theft; updates in methods of identity theft; updates in customary methods used to detect, prevent, and mitigate identity
                  theft; updates in the types of accounts that the city offers or maintains; and updates in service provider arrangements.
                  Program administration. The assistant city clerk is responsible for oversight of the program and for program
                  implementation. The city clerk/treasurer is responsible for reviewing reports prepared by staff regarding compliance with
                  red flag requirements and with recommending material changes to the program, as necessary in the opinion of the city
                  clerk/treasurer, to address changing identity theft risks and to identify new or discontinued types of covered accounts.
                  Any recommended material changes to the program shall be submitted to the city council for consideration by the
                  council. The assistant city clerk will report to the city clerk/treasurer at least annually, on compliance with the red flag
                  requirements. The report will address material matters related to the program and evaluate issues such as: The
                  effectiveness of the policies and procedures in addressing the risk of identity theft in connection with the opening of
                  covered accounts and with respect to existing covered accounts; service provider arrangements; significant incidents
                  involving identity theft and management's response; and recommendations for material changes to the program. The
                  assistant city clerk, is responsible for providing training to all employees responsible for or involved in opening a new

                  Sec. 58-96. - Treatment of address discrepancies.
                  Short title. This section shall be known as treatment of address discrepancies.
                  Purpose. Pursuant to 16 CFR § 681.1, the purpose of this section is to establish a process by which the city will be able to
                  form a reasonable belief that a consumer report relates to the consumer about whom it has requested a consumer credit
                  report when the city has received a notice of address discrepancy.
                  Notice of address discrepancy means a notice sent to a user by a consumer reporting agency pursuant to 15 U.S.C. §
                  1681(c)(h)(1), that informs the user of a substantial difference between the address for the consumer that the user
                  provided to request the consumer report and the address(es) in the agency's file for the consumer.
                  Policy. If the city receives a notice of address discrepancy, the city employee responsible for verifying consumer

                  (a)
                  addresses for the purpose of providing the municipal service or account sought by the consumer shall perform one or
                  more of the following activities, as determined to be appropriate by such employee:
                  Compare the information in the consumer report with: information the city obtains and uses to verify a consumer's
                  identity in accordance with the requirements of the Customer Information Program rules implementing 31 U.S.C. §
                  5318(1); information the city maintains in its own records, such as applications for service, change of address
                  notices, other customer account records or tax records; or information the city obtains from third-party sources
                  that are deemed reliable by the relevant city employee; or
                  Verify the information in the consumer report with the consumer.
                  Furnishing consumer's address to consumer reporting agency. If the city reasonably confirms that an address provided
                  by a consumer to the city is accurate, the city is required to provide such address to the consumer reporting agency from
                  which the city received a notice of address discrepancy with respect to such consumer. This information is required to be
                  provided to the consumer reporting agency when: The city is able to form a reasonable belief that the consumer report
                  relates to the consumer about whom the city requested the report; the city establishes a continuing relation with the
                  consumer; and the city regularly and in the ordinary course of business provides information to the consumer reporting
                  agency from which it received the notice of address discrepancy. Such information shall be provided to the consumer
                  reporting agency as part of the information regularly provided by the city to such agency for the reporting period in
                  which the city establishes a relationship with the customer.
                  Methods of confirming consumer addresses. The city employee charged with confirming consumer addresses may, in his
                  or her discretion, confirm the accuracy of an address through one or more of the following methods: verifying the
                  address with the consumer; reviewing the city's records to verify the consumer's address; verifying the address through
                  third party sources; or using other reasonable process.

                  All appliances, except movable appliances, shall be installed with steel or iron piping together with fittings and unions. Tubing of
                  copper, aluminum or plastic may be used on small movable appliances provided such tubing is approved by the gas inspector and an
                  adequate compression coupling is used for connections.

                  A shutoff cock shall be installed in each outlet within two inches of the floor or wall line, as well as a shutoff cock at the appliance
                  itself.

                  Appliances shall be located far enough from the wall to remove any danger of the wall becoming hot enough to ignite. Vents shall
                  be installed in a size and manner recommended by the manufacturers of the appliance and shall be to the satisfaction of the gas
                  inspector.

                  Sec. 58-155. - Use of LP gas piping.
                  Since natural gas will be utilized in many homes previously having LP gas service, it will be in the discretion of the gas inspector as to
                  how much of the existing piping is usable. Mercury gauge or monometer tests and installation of appliances will still have to meet the
                  requirements of this article. In general, three-eighths-inch copper tubing does not provide adequate service for natural gas, while fiveeighths-inch tubing may provide adequate service for small runs or limited numbers of appliances. If there is doubt that existing piping
                  will provide adequate service for natural gas, a test may be made to determine that all appliances in the house work adequately and
                  simultaneously without undue loss of pressure. If, in the judgment of the gas inspector, no future additional appliances will be added or
                  if there is adequate capacity for future appliances, the piping can be determined satisfactory if it meets all other requirements, except as
                  to size, of this article.

                  Each service line shall consist of a service tee either welded to the main or installed on the main with a two strap saddle clamp. The
                  tee shall be of the same size as the service piping. A lubricated lock wing cock shall be installed on each service on the upstream side of
                  the regulator and in a readily accessible place. The size of the line, regulator and meter shall be determined by the city.

                  pressure regulator set, not to exceed $25.00. From the downstream connection of the high pressure regulator set, the line customer will
                  receive the same service as the customers served from the city distribution system. If more than one line customer is served by a single
                  high pressure regulator set, the cost of the regulator set may be prorated among the line customers being served by it.
