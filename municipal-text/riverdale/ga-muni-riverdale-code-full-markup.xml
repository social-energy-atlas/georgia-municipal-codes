PREFACE 
</p>
        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Riverdale, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1976 Code, as supplemented through April 1995, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1976 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Palmer Carr, Supervising Editor, and Ronald McLaughlin, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Sandra Meyers, City Clerk, and Mr. Steven M. Fincher, City Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Notice of special or called meetings shall be served by the city clerk or his or her designee on all other members personally or by telephone at least 24 hours in advance of the meeting. If the clerk or his or her designee is unable to reach a member, it shall be deemed sufficient notice under this section if telephonic communication is attempted via the member's telephone number designated for that purpose or by delivery of written notice at the member's home address, provided such attempt is made at least 24 hours in advance of the meeting and, if possible, a message is left for the member. Notice to councilmembers of special or called meetings shall not be required if the mayor and all councilmembers are present when the special meeting is convened. Notice of any special or called meeting may be waived by a member in writing either before or after such a meeting.

                  (a)  Each member of the governing body shall have a right to speak and address any matter or issue before the governing body, for up to a total initial time limit of three minutes per matter or issue. However, when a member of the governing body wishes to make a motion or speak during a discussion or debate, he or she must first be recognized by the presiding officer in order to speak. The mayor is the presiding officer for city council meetings unless absent in which case, the mayor pro tem shall preside. Council members are not permitted to call out or interrupt another speaker. The order in which members of the governing body are to be recognized for the purpose of addressing or speaking to any particular issue or subject matter shall be determined by the presiding officer in his or her discretion, provided that the presiding officer shall not be entitled to prohibit a member of the governing body from speaking regarding each issue or matter under discussion, for up to a total of three minutes for each issue or matter. The only manner in which any member of the governing body may be recognized by the presiding officer for the purpose of speaking during a meeting is to first raise a hand and be recognized by the presiding officer, in accordance with this subsection. 
                  (b)  When making remarks at a meeting, each member of the governing body shall confine his or her remarks to the topic being discussed or debated, and shall avoid personal attacks upon other members of the governing body or upon the motives or character of other members. 
                  (c)  After all members of the governing body who wish to speak on a single topic have been allowed to speak, then the presiding officer shall have the right, but not the obligation, to allow a member of the governing body to speak a second time on the subject or topic being discussed, for up to a total of two additional minutes for each topic or subject being discussed. 
                  (d)  A second is required for any motion to assure minimum support for the motion. 
                  (e)  When a second is not forthcoming, the motion will "die for lack of a second," and the presiding officer shall so announce. Then the next order of business will be taken up without further debate or discussion. 
                  (f)  The presiding officer has the right to rule remarks or comments out of order and thereby terminate them, if a council member has already made essentially the same point, or if the council member is repeating something he or she has already stated. The purpose of this rule is to avoid redundancies and repeating the same point more than once, and to avoid wasting time during debate and discussion. 
                  (g)  No council member shall be allowed to speak on any one topic for more than a total of five minutes during any single meeting. 
                  (h)  This section shall not affect the time limits set forth in the city's zoning ordinance.

                  (a)  All requests for recognition by the presiding officer must be done by first raising a hand and waiting for the presiding officer to recognize the council member in order to begin speaking. Except for raising a "point of order," at no time shall any council member be allowed to interrupt the presiding officer if he or she is speaking, for any purpose. 
                  (b)  All comments of any council member shall be addressed to the presiding officer or to the general public in attendance at the meeting; provided however that it shall be the privilege of a council member to ask any question to the city manager, any city staff person or the city attorneys. 
                  (c)  No council member shall be permitted to make rude, obnoxious, slanderous, or personal attacks on anyone, including but not limited to any other member of council or the presiding officer. All council members shall also refrain from side discussions or other distractions during a meeting.

                  (a)  A member of the city council may raise a "point of inquiry" if a simple clarification of a motion (a motion that is already before the council for consideration) is needed. This should be done by raising a hand and stating to the presiding officer, "point of inquiry," and at that time the presiding officer may in his or her discretion, recognize the council member by stating "state your point." 
                  (b)  Points of inquiry are used sparingly and only in case of honest confusion as to the intent or meaning of a then pending motion. A point of inquiry may not be used to simply add to the debate or discussion. 
                  (c)  Clarification cannot take longer than three minutes.

                  (a)  A council member may interrupt a speaker in order to raise a "point of order," if the council member reasonably believes a meeting is being conducted in a manner inconsistent with these rules or Robert's Rules of Order. 
                  (b)  If a point of order is properly raised by the council member being recognized by the presiding officer to speak, then the council member who was speaking will upon request of the presiding officer yield the floor for the limited purpose of hearing the point of order. 
                  (c)  The mayor would then say "state your point" and the point of order will be handled in accordance with Robert's Rules of Order.

                  Sec. 2-34. - Public comments. 
                  (a)  Public comments will be allowed only during the "public comments" period of each regular meeting of the governing body at the time shown on the agenda. Members of the public are not allowed to participate in any debate or discussion being conducted by the members of the governing body. 
                  (b)  Public comments will be limited in time to a total of three minutes per speaker, and a total time limit at any one meeting of 15 minutes. If more than five potential speakers sign up to make public comments, then the total amount of time permitted for each individual speaker will be reduced by an announcement of the presiding officer, so as to limit the total time to 15 minutes. 
                  (c)  No person may sign up more than once in an effort to gain more time for a public comment. 
                  (d)  Public comments during a meeting of the city governing body will only be allowed to residents of the City of Riverdale or to owners of businesses maintaining a business site physically situated within the corporate limits of the City of Riverdale. 
                  (e)  Persons not residing within the City of Riverdale who do not own a business as specified in subsection (d) above who wish to address the governing body during any regular meeting must first request that they be placed on the agenda for the upcoming regular meeting, such request to be made in writing by close of business at city hall on the Wednesday immediately preceding the regular meeting at which they wish to speak. 
                  (f)  All public comments must be limited to matters on the agenda or over which the governing body has jurisdiction. 
                  (g)  Nonresidents who do not own a business as specified in subsection (d) above will also be limited to three minutes per speaker, and a total of 15 minutes for an entire group of speakers at any single meeting, whether they are speaking on the same topic or not. If more than five potential nonresident speakers are placed on the agenda in order to address the governing body, the time permitted for each individual speaker shall be reduced so as to limit the total time for speaking for such nonresidents to 15 minutes at any one meeting.

                  (a)  Speakers may raise any point of concern regarding any matter on the agenda or any matter over which the governing body has jurisdiction, but each speaker must maintain a decorous demeanor and refrain from personal attacks upon members of the governing body, shouting and using obscene language. 
                  (b)  The presiding officer may interrupt and take the floor away from individuals who violate subsection (a) above. 
                  (c)  Comments which are redundant or repetitive from previous statements made in the same meeting may be ruled out of order and terminated by the presiding officer.

                  Sec. 2-36. - Removal for violation of these rules. 
                  Any council member who violates these rules must first be orally warned by the presiding officer, and if the council member then interrupts another speaker or speaks out without being recognized, or violates these rules in any other way for a second time in a single meeting, then the presiding officer may ask the sergeant at arms (a sworn City of Riverdale Police Officer) to remove the offending council member from the city council chambers for the remainder of the meeting.

                  Editor's note— Ord. No. 13-2006, adopted July 24, 2006, amended the Code by repealing former ch. 3, §§ 3-1—3-19, and adding a new ch. 3. Former ch. 3 pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from Ord. No. 01-14, adopted October 8, 2001. 

                  Sec. 3-1. - Title. 
                  This chapter shall hereafter be known and cited as the "Code of Ethics." 
                  (Ord. No. 13-2006, § 1, 7-24-06; Ord. No. 12-2007, 8-13-07) 
                  Sec. 3-2. - Declaration of policy. 
                  It is essential to the proper administration and operation of the city that its elected officials and others appointed to positions of public service: 
                  (1)  Serve others, not themselves; 
                  (2)  Use resources with efficiency and economy; 
                  (3)  Treat all people fairly; 
                  (4)  Use the power of their positions for the well being of their constituents; and 
                  (5)  Create an environment of honesty, openness and integrity. 
                  Because the attainment of one or more of these ends is impaired whenever there exists in fact, or appears to exist, a conflict between the private interests and public duties of elected and appointed officials, the public interest requires that the city protect against such conflicts of interest by establishing appropriate ethical standards with respect to the conduct of said individuals. 
                  It is also essential to the efficient operation of the city that those persons best qualified be encouraged to serve in positions of public trust. Accordingly, the standards set forth in this chapter must be interpreted and understood so as not to unreasonably frustrate or impede the desire or inclination of those best qualified to seek and serve in public office. To that end, the city's elected and appointed officials should not, except as otherwise provided by law, be denied the opportunities available to all other citizens to acquire and maintain private, economic and other interests, except where a conflict of interest appears. 
                  The policy and purpose of this Chapter, therefore, is to: 
                  (1)  Make clear those standards of ethical conduct that shall apply to all elected officials in the discharge of their public duties; 
                  (2)  Comport with the objective of protecting the integrity of the city and its government; 
                  (3)  Prescribe only such essential restrictions as will not impose barriers repugnant to conscientious public service; 
                  (4)  State principles of ethics which are to be applied in public service; 
                  (5)  Identify the minimum standards of ethical conduct for public servants; 
                  (6)  Require that public servants engage in ethical practices which always meet minimum standards; 
                  (7)  Provide a process by which public servants may identify and resolve ethical issues; and 
                  (8)  Promote public confidence in the integrity of public servants and to establish penalties, as appropriate, for public servants who violate the public trust.

Example: (1) population = 10,000, then two licenses may be issued; (2) population = 15,000, then three licenses; (3) population = 20,000, then four licenses.

                  (1)  All licenses issued under this chapter shall remain in effect for the calendar-year of issuance (i.e. for all licenses granted between January 1 and December 31 of a given calendar year, the license shall remain in effect until the close of business on December 31 of that same calendar year).

                  1.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of a corporation, a new alcohol license shall not be required as herein provided unless a change in stock ownership in the corporation results in ownership of more than 50 percent of the outstanding corporate stock, voting or otherwise, by persons or combinations of persons not owners of such stock at the time the license was issued. "Any interest" is defined as being an ownership of stock or control of 50 percent or more of the partnership or corporation. 
                  2.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, one or more partners in a partnership holding a license may withdraw in favor of one or more of the existing partners. 
                  b.  The transfer of ownership of a business shall not affect the distance requirements previously approved by the city. 
                  c.  Upon the sale or other transfer of any interest in the business for which the license was issued, the purchaser or transferee of such interest shall be entitled to continue to operate such business for a period of no more than 60 days, pending the issuance of a new license, but only if such purchaser or transferee has filed an application with the city as required in subsection a. 
                  d.  In case of the death of any natural person holding a city alcohol license, or any interest therein, the license may be transferred to the administrator, executor of the lawful heir or devisee of the deceased person by filing a new application with the city for the change in license ownership within 75 days of such death. The business involved may continue to operate until disposition of the application. No additional fees or business taxes shall be charged above what would be due if the business, or portion thereof, remained under the deceased person's ownership.

                  (d)  Investigations. The mayor and city council shall have the right to make such inquiry or investigation as it may find to be reasonably necessary to determine compliance with this chapter. Such investigation may consist, among other actions, of calling licensees for examination under oath, obtaining evidence under oath from other persons; the procurement of documents and records including records of the licensee, and inspection and examination of records and documents from whatever source obtainable. 
                  (e)  Grounds for suspension or revocation of license. 
                  (1)  The following shall be considered just cause for the suspension or revocation of a license issued under this chapter:

If such act, omission or violation is done by an agent, servant, employee, or officer of the licensee, the lack of knowledge on the part of the licensee or the lack of authorization for such act or omission or violation shall be no defense. 
                  b.  The entry of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, or the conviction of any licensee, partner, or any officer, director or stockholder of a licensee corporation with respect to a charge of violation of any of the laws of the United States or of the state relating to alcohol control, narcotics or gambling. 
                  c.  Any course of conduct or activity on the premises with respect to the operation of a business licensed hereunder which the city shall find to be contrary to the public interest, and of sufficient duration to constitute a nuisance or which shall render the licensee or the business location unfit for the continued operation of the business.

                  (f)  No new license to be issued after revocation. When a license has been revoked under the provisions of this article, no application for a new alcoholic beverage license for the same location will be received for a period of 24 months and no application for a new license from the licensee involved shall be received for a period of 24 months.

                  Editor's note— Ord. No. 05-2008, § 1, adopted April 28, 2008, amended Art. II, in its entirety, to read as herein set out. Prior to inclusion of said ordinance, Art. II pertained to similar subject matter. See also the Code Comparative Table. 

                  Sec. 10-26. - Findings and public purpose. 
                  (a)  The City of Riverdale engaged in considerable fact-finding with respect to the secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments prior to the original adoption of this article. The city relied on the experiences of other urban counties and cities, including but not limited to: DeKalb, Fulton and Richmond counties; the cities of Atlanta, College Park and Smyrna, Georgia; Austin, Texas; Los Angeles and Garden Grove, California; Phoenix, Arizona; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Indianapolis, Indiana; and also on findings from the Report of the Attorney General's Working Group On the Regulation of Sexually Oriented Businesses (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota). The city heard evidence and testimony of the citizens and experts, and the city council took note of the well-known and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which does not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within our country. 
                  (b)  In preparing the revision of this article in 2008, the city reviewed updated evidence of recent experiences of counties and cities, held a public hearing and reviewed the current city zoning map, comp plan, LCI study and redevelopment plan. 
                  (c)  With respect to live entertainment, the potential of adult entertainment establishments to serve as the source of connection between parties for various criminal offenses of a sexual nature has long been recognized. Because both parties to such activity frequently are consenting, crime statistics do not fully bear out the extent of criminal activity existing within such establishments and occurring off-site but originating through contact within such establishments. Studies bear out a correlation between the amount of clothing removed and aggression. Similarly, non-live adult entertainment venues pose health risks and can serve as a contact point for patrons making themselves available to one another, resulting in the possibility that communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring therein. 
                  (d)  Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, live commercial nudity in general and photographic adult entertainment are disorderly conduct, prostitution, solicitation, drug trafficking, drug use and corruption of public officials. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, commercial nudity in general and photographic adult entertainment are depression of property values and acceleration of community blight in the surrounding neighborhood, increased allocation of and expenditure for law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order due, in part, to increases in criminal activity due to traffic congestion, unusual hours of operation, litter and noise problems, and increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described. 
                  (e)  Further, it is the finding of the city council that other forms of adult entertainment establishments, including, but not limited to, adult bookstores, adult video stores, peep shows and adult theaters, have a deleterious effect upon the quality of life in neighborhoods, commercial districts and urban life in general. 
                  (f)  The purpose of this article is to regulate adult entertainment establishments to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses and their resultant health risks will be curtailed. The preservation of stable residential areas and attractive vibrant commercial activity is a further goal of this article. However, it is recognized that regulation of adult entertainment establishments cannot de facto approach prohibition. Otherwise, a protected form of expression would vanish. This article represents a balancing of competing interests: reduced criminal activity and protection of the neighborhoods through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments versus the protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons.

                  (a)  The city council herein finds that control of animals is a major problem that affects the health and safety of the citizens of the City of Riverdale.

                  (b)  An owner of a dog shall confine such dog while on the owner's property within an adequate fence or enclosure of sufficient height and construction to prevent the dog from escaping by jumping, digging or any other means. 
                  (c)  It shall be unlawful for any owner of any chicken, duck, horse, cow, goat, pig or any other type of animal, livestock or other fowl within the city to permit such animal to run at large or be a menace or nuisance to such person's neighbors or the public in general. 
                  (d)  It shall be unlawful for any animal owner to allow such owner's animal to enter a store, restaurant, convenience store or other place where food is exhibited for sale, whether the animal owner is a patron or owner of the food service establishment, except those animals trained for the blind, hearing impaired, handicapped and law enforcement.

                  (b)  It is unlawful and a violation of this article for a pet owner to allow by omission or commission their pet dog or cat to become pregnant without first securing a breeding permit from the Clayton County Animal Control Unit.

                  (1)  To confine an animal in a vehicle in an inhumane manner such that the animal can become overheated, lacks adequate ventilation or is otherwise harmed. 
                  (2)  For any owner to fail to provide any animal under his control with adequate and proper food, fresh water and veterinary care. For the purpose of this subsection, owner shall mean any person, legal entity, corporation, partnership, firm or trust owning, possessing or having custody or control of the premises where the animal is located. For the purpose of this subsection, adequate food shall mean food of a sufficient quantity of noncontaminated and nutritionally healthy substance that is appropriate to the species, breed, size, age and health of the animal, or at the direction of a licensed veterinarian, which is sufficient to prevent starvation, malnutrition or risk to the animal's health. Garbage, spoiled, rancid or contaminated food is not adequate food. Adequate water means clean, fresh, potable water sufficient to prevent dehydration and properly sustain health presented in a clean dish, free from contamination.

It must be maintained clean, dry and compatible with current weather conditions, in addition to age, size, species and condition of the animal.

                  (3)  The community development department may accept a sworn affidavit from a registered architect or engineer stating that the plans submitted conform to the construction codes. For buildings and structures, the affidavit shall state that the plans conform to the laws as to egress, type of construction and general arrangement and if accompanied by drawings showing the structural design, and by a statement that the plans and design conform to the requirements of the construction codes as to strength, stresses, strains, loads and stability. The community development department may, without any examination or inspection, accept such affidavit, provided the architect or engineer who made such affidavit agrees to submit to the building official, copies of inspection reports as inspections are performed and upon completion of the structure, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing systems a certification that the structure, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing system has been erected in accordance with the requirements of the construction codes. Where the community development department relies upon such affidavit, the architect or engineer shall assume full responsibility for the compliance with the provisions of the construction codes and other pertinent laws or ordinances. 
                  (4)  This city shall not require changes in the construction documents, construction or designated occupancy of a structure for which a lawful permit has been heretofore issued or otherwise lawfully authorized, and the construction of which has been pursued in good faith within 180 days after the effective date of this Code and has not been abandoned. 
                  (5)  The building official is authorized to issue a permit for the construction of foundations or any other part of a building or structure before the construction documents for the whole building or structure have been submitted, provided that adequate information and detailed statements have been filed complying with pertinent requirements of this Code. The holder of such permit for the foundation or other parts of a building or structure shall proceed at the holder's own risk with the building operation and without assurance that a permit for the entire structure will be granted. 
                  (6)  When it is required that documents be prepared by a registered design professional, the building official shall be authorized to require the owner to engage and designate on the building permit application a registered design professional who shall act as the registered design professional in responsible charge. If the circumstances require, the owner shall designate a substitute registered design professional in responsible charge who shall perform the duties required of the original registered design professional in responsible charge. The building official shall be notified in writing by the owner if the registered design professional in responsible charge is changed or is unable to continue to perform the duties. The registered design professional in responsible charge shall be responsible for reviewing and coordinating submittal documents prepared by others, including phased and deferred submittal items, for compatibility with the design of the building. 
                  (7)  For the purposes of this section, deferred submittals are defined as those portions of the design that are not submitted at the time of the application and that are to be submitted to the building official within a specified period. 
                  (8)  Deferral of any submittal items shall have the prior approval of the building official. The registered design professional in responsible charge shall list the deferred submittals on the construction documents for review by the building official. 
                  (9)  Documents for deferred submittal items shall be submitted to the registered design professional in responsible charge who shall review them and forward them to the building official with a notation indicating that the deferred submittal documents have been reviewed and found to be in general conformance to the design of the building. The deferred submittal items shall not be installed until the deferred submittal documents have been approved by the building official. 
                  (10)  Work shall be installed in accordance with the approved construction documents, and any changes made during construction that are not in compliance with the approved construction documents shall be resubmitted for approval as an amended set of construction documents. 
                  (11)  One set of approved construction documents shall be retained by the building official for a period of not less than 180 days from date of completion of the permitted work, or as required by state or local laws. 
                  (12)  When the building official issues a permit, the construction documents shall be approved, in writing or by stamp, as "Reviewed for Code Compliance." One set of construction documents so reviewed shall be retained by the building official. The other set shall be returned to the applicant, shall be kept at the site of work and shall be open to inspection by the building official or a duly authorized representative. 
                  (d)  Issuing of permits. 
                  (1)  The department shall act upon an application for a permit without unreasonable or unnecessary delay. If the department is satisfied that the work described in an application for permit and the contract documents filed therewith conform to the requirements of the construction codes and other pertinent laws and ordinances, it shall issue a permit to the applicant. 
                  (2)  If the application for a permit and the accompanying contract documents describing the work do not conform to the requirements of the construction codes or other pertinent laws or ordinances, the building safety division will not issue a permit, but shall return the contract documents to the applicant with the refusal to issue such permit. Such refusal shall, when requested, be in writing and shall contain the reason for refusal. 
                  (3)  It shall be the duty of every contractor who shall make contracts for the installation or repairs of buildings, structures, electrical, gas, mechanical, sprinkler or plumbing systems, for which a permit is required, to comply with state and local rules and regulations concerning licenses which the applicable governing authority may have adopted. In such case that the state requires a contractor to have obtained a state license before they are permitted to perform work, the contractor shall supply the local government with a copy of their state license before receiving a permit for work to be performed. 
                  (e)  Conditions of permit. 
                  (1)  A permit issued shall be construed to be a license to proceed with the work and not as authority to violate, cancel, alter or set aside any of the provisions of the construction codes, nor shall issuance of a permit prevent the community development department from thereafter requiring a correction of errors in plans, construction or violations of the construction codes. Every permit issued shall become invalid unless the work authorized by such permit is commenced within 180 days after its issuance, or if the work authorized by such permit is suspended or abandoned for period of 180 days after the time the work is commenced. One or more extensions of time, for periods not more than 180 days each, may be granted by the building official. The extension shall be requested in writing and justifiable cause demonstrated. Extensions, if granted, shall be in writing. 
                  (2)  Whenever a permit is issued in reliance upon an affidavit or whenever the work to be covered by a permit involves installation under conditions which, in the opinion of the city, are hazardous or complex, the community development department shall require that the architect or engineer who signed the affidavit or prepared the drawings or computations supervise such work. In addition, they shall be responsible for conformity with the permit, provide copies of inspection reports as inspections are performed and, upon completion, make and file with the building official written affidavit that the work has been done in conformity with the reviewed plans and with the structural provisions of the construction codes. In the event such architect or engineer is not available, the owner shall employ in his stead a competent person or agency whose qualifications are reviewed by the building official. 
                  (3)  When the city issues a permit, it shall enforce, in writing or by stamp, both sets of plans "reviewed for code compliance." The community development department shall retain one set of drawings so reviewed and the other set shall be returned to the applicant. 
                  (4)  The permitted drawings, associated inspection reports, and all other written communication shall be kept at the site of work and shall be open to inspection by the city. 
                  (5)  The building permit or copy shall be kept at the site, protected from the weather and visible to the right-of-way. 
                  (f)  Fees. 
                  (1)  A permit shall not be issued until the fees prescribed by the governing body have been paid. No amendment to a permit shall be released until the additional fee, if any, due to an increase in the estimated cost of the building, structure, electrical, plumbing, mechanical or gas systems, etc., has been paid. 
                  (2)  Any person who commences any work on a building, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing, etc., system before obtaining the necessary permits, shall be subject to penalty fees in accordance with the fee schedules as set by the mayor/council. 
                  (3)  All work commenced without permits shall be subject to removal at the expense of the property owner. 
                  (4)  On all buildings, structures, electrical, plumbing, mechanical and gas systems or alterations requiring a permit, a fee for each permit shall be paid as required at the time of filing application, in accordance with the fee schedules as set by the governing body. 
                  (5)  If, in the opinion of the city, the valuation of building, alteration, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing systems appears to be underestimated on the application, the permit shall be denied, unless the applicant can show detailed estimates to meet the approval of the city. Permit valuations shall include total cost, such as electrical, gas, mechanical, plumbing equipment and other systems, including materials and labor. Final building permit valuation shall be set by the building official. 
                  (6)  The payment of the fee for the construction, alteration, removal or demolition for work done in connection to or concurrently with the work authorized by a building permit shall not relieve the applicant or holder of the permit from the payment of other fees that are prescribed by law. 
                  (7)  The building official is authorized to establish a refund policy. 
                  (g)  Inspections. 
                  (1)  Construction or work for which a permit is required shall be subject to inspection by the building safety division and such construction or work shall remain accessible and exposed for inspection purposes until approved. 
                  (2)  Approval as a result of an inspection shall not be construed to be an approval of a violation of the provisions of this Code or of other ordinances of the jurisdiction. Inspections presuming to give authority to violate or cancel the provisions of this Code or of other ordinances of the jurisdiction shall not be valid. 
                  (3)  Neither the building official nor the jurisdiction shall be liable for expense entailed in the removal or replacement of any material required to allow inspection. 
                  (4)  Before issuing a permit the city may examine or cause to be examined any building, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing systems for which an application has been received for permit to enlarge, alter, repair, move, demolish, install, or change the occupancy. 
                  (5)  The city shall inspect or cause to be inspected at various intervals all construction or work for which permit is required, and a final inspection shall be made of every building, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing system upon completion, prior to the issuance of the certificate of occupancy or completion.

                  (3)  That granting the appeal requested will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by the construction codes to other buildings, structures or service system; 
                  (4)  That the appeal granted is the minimum that will make possible the reasonable use of the building, structure or service system; 
                  (5)  That the grant of the appeal will be in harmony with the general intent and purpose of the codes and will not be detrimental to the public health, safety and general welfare; 
                  (6)  In granting the appeal, the mayor/council may prescribe a reasonable time limit within which the action shall be commenced or completed or both. In addition, the mayor/council may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with the codes. Violation of the conditions of an appeal shall be deemed a violation of the codes. 
                  (d)  Notice of appeal of decisions of the community development department shall be in writing and filed within 20 calendar days after the department renders its decision. Appeals shall be in a form acceptable to the community development department. 
                  (e)  In the case of a building, structure, or service system, which, in the opinion of the community development department, is unsafe, unsanitary or dangerous, the building official may, in his order, limit the time for such notice of appeals to a shorter period.

                  (1)  In any case where the violator and/or owner, agent or tenant fails to abate the violation within the time specified by the building safety division, other designated officer, or the court, or where the violator and/or owner, agent or tenant cannot be served with notice, or where the nature of the violation is such, in the opinion of the judge, that it must be immediately abated, the judge may issue an order to the chief of police, fire chief, building official, or code enforcement official directing the nuisance to be abated. The chief of police, fire chief, building official, or code enforcement official, in such case, shall keep a record of the expenses and costs of abating the violation, and the costs shall be billed against the violator and/or owner, agent or tenant for collection as for city revenues. The total expense, including administrative costs, incurred by the city in abating violations under this article shall constitute a lien upon the property upon which the violation was abated. 
                  (2)  When a violation is of such magnitude or degree that city equipment and personnel cannot safely or completely abate it, the city may contract with a private contractor to abate the violation on the city's behalf. 
                  (3)  City officers, employees, or any city contractor shall have the right of entry upon real property and shall be immune from prosecution, civil or criminal, for trespass upon real property while in the discharge of their duties in removing or abating any violation under this article.

                  Sec. 18-120. - Short title. 
                  This article shall be known as the "Vacant and Foreclosed Property Ordinance."

                  Sec. 18-121. - Findings and intent. 
                  This article is adopted to address the interest of public safety. 
                  (1)  The governing authority finds that within the city limits, there are buildings and structures that are vacant and pose a danger to the citizens of the city. Vacant structures are vulnerable to break-ins, criminal activity, destruction, fire, accidents, looting and other unsafe activities that are injurious to the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city. In addition, they can attract and/or cause blight and other harmful effects to surrounding properties. 
                  (2)  The governing authority finds that there is a need to establish a foreclosure and vacant real property registry as a mechanism to protect property values in neighborhoods for all property owners. 
                  (3)  Due to the lack of adequate maintenance and security of properties that are foreclosed or where ownership has been transferred after foreclosure, the property values and quality of life of neighboring properties are negatively impacted. 
                  (4)  Improperly maintained and secured foreclosed properties can become a hazard to the health and safety of persons who may come on or near the property and can adversely affect the aesthetic and economic attributes of communities. Difficulties also often arise in locating the person responsible for the condition of foreclosed real property. The governing authority finds that there is a substantial need directly related to the public health, safety and welfare to comprehensively address these concerns through the adoption of the provisions in this article. 
                  (5)  This foreclosure and vacant real property registry will require owners and agents to provide the city with official information for contacting a party responsible for bringing foreclosed and vacant real property into compliance with applicable provisions of Municipal Code of Riverdale, Georgia.

                  Sec. 22-281. - Findings. 
                  The city council finds that certain facilities used for the congregation for commercial activity because of the nature of the activity carried on therein carry unique challenges to the safety, health and welfare of the public at large and to patrons of such facilities. Certain types of these facilities attract patrons who because of their age and the lack of parental supervision are subject to potential exploitation by other patrons and/or employees or such patrons are themselves the cause of threats to the public health, safety and welfare. As a consequence, the mayor and council find that the regulations enacted in this article are necessary to protect the public health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city.

                  (i)  A grantee shall maintain, repair and keep in good condition for a period of one year following such disturbance all portions of a sidewalk or street disturbed by it or its agents, provided such maintenance and repairs shall be made necessary because of defective workmanship or materials supplied by grantee.

                  Sec. 30-139. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices. 
                  (a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the article and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of section 30-139(b) and (c) of this article. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit. 
                  (b)  Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
                  (1)  Best management practices as set forth in section 30-139(b) and (c) of this article shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of storm water issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act." As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
                  (2)  A discharge of storm water runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local Issuing Authority or of any state general permit issued by the Division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a Local Issuing Authority or of any state general permit issued by the Division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land-disturbing activities occur. 
                  (5)  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsections (c)(15), (16) and (17), in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
                  (c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  (7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in section 30-139(b)(2) of this article; 
                  (15)  Except as provided in paragraphs (16) and (17) of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or where bulkheads and sea walls are installed to prevent shoreline erosion on Lake Oconee and Lake Sinclair; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term 'ephemeral stream' means a stream: That under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The Director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (17)  There is established a 25-foot buffer along coastal marshlands, as measured horizontally from the coastal marshland-upland interface, as determined in accordance with Chapter 5 of Title 12 of this title, the "Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1970." And the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where an alteration within the buffer area has been authorized pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-286, for maintenance of any currently serviceable structure, landscaping, or hardscaping, including bridges, roads, parking lots, golf courses, golf cart paths, retaining walls, bulkheads, and patios; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, where a drainage structure or roadway drainage structure is constructed or maintained; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, on the landward side of any currently serviceable shoreline stabilization structure, or for the maintenance of any manmade storm-water detention basin, golf course pond, or impoundment that is located entirely within the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. For the purposes of this paragraph maintenance shall be defined as actions necessary or appropriate for retaining or restoring a currently serviceable improvement to the specified operable condition to achieve its maximum useful life. Maintenance includes emergency reconstruction of recently damaged parts of a currently serviceable structure so long as it occurs within a reasonable period of time after damage occurs. Maintenance does not include any modification that changes the character, scope or size of the original design and serviceable shall be defined as usable in its current state or with minor maintenance but not so degraded as to essentially require reconstruction. 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat. 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to crossings for utility lines that cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer, provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
                  c.  The buffer shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity conducted pursuant to and in compliance with a valid and effective land-disturbing permit issued subsequent to April 22, 2014, and prior to December 31, 2015; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented or any lot for which the preliminary plat has been approved prior to December 31, 2015 if roadways, bridges, or water and sewer lines have been extended to such lot prior to the effective date of this Act and if the requirement to maintain a 25-foot buffer would consume at least 18 percent of the high ground of the platted lot otherwise available for development; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
                  d.  Activities where the area within the buffer is not more than 500 square feet or that have a "minor buffer impact" as defined in section 391-3-7-.01(r), provided that the total area of buffer impacts is less than 5,000 square feet are deemed to have an approved buffer variance by rule. Bank stabilization structures are not eligible for coverage under the variance by rule and notification shall be made to the division at least 14 days prior to the commencement of land-disturbing activities. 
                  (d)  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any Local Issuing Authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in section 30-139(b) and (c) of this article. 
                  (e)  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit.

                  (a)  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The Local Issuing Authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, storm water management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, the ordinance from which this article is derived, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
                  (b)  Application requirements. 
                  (1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the City of Riverdale without first obtaining a permit from the City of Riverdale to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
                  (2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the City of Riverdale and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in section 30-140(c) of this article. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land-disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of section 30-139(b) and (c) of this article will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by five copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
                  (3)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  (4)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by section 30-139(c)(15), (16) and (17) have been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per section 30-140(b)(6), have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
                  (5)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this article section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
                  (6)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  (c)  Plan requirements. 
                  (1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in section 30-139(b) and (c) of this article, or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this article. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and storm water management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land-disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
                  (2)  Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
                  (d)  Permits. 
                  (1)  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
                  (2)  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this article, any variances required by section 30-139(c)(15), (16) and (17) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per section 130-140(b)(6) are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
                  (3)  Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this article, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
                  (4)  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
                  (5)  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this article. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
                  (6)  The LIA may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(f)(1).

                  (a)  The City of Riverdale will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article. 
                  (b)  The local issuing authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within 12 months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975. 
                  (c)  The City of Riverdale shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this article, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities. 
                  (d)  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
                  (e)  The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). The district or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
                  (f)  The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within 90 days after notification by the division, the division shall revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority.

                  Sec. 30-178. - Illegal discharge and illegal connection. 
                  (a)  Introduction. It is hereby determined that: 
                  (1)  Discharges to the city/county storm sewer system that are not composed entirely of stormwater runoff contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters; 
                  (2)  These non-stormwater discharges occur due to spills, dumping and improper connections to the city/county storm sewer system from residential, industrial, commercial or institutional establishments. 
                  (3)  These non-stormwater discharges not only impact waterways individually, but geographically dispersed, small volume non-stormwater discharges can have cumulative impacts on receiving waters. 
                  (4)  The impacts of these discharges adversely affect public health and safety, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters; 
                  (5)  These impacts can be minimized through the regulation of spills, dumping and discharges into the city/county storm sewer system; 
                  (6)  Localities in the state are required to comply with a number of state and federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution due to improper non-stormwater discharges to the city/county storm sewer system. 
                  Therefore, the city adopts this section to prohibit such non-stormwater discharges to the city/county storm sewer system. It is determined that the regulation of spills, improper dumping and discharges to the city/county storm sewer system is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety, and the environment. 
                  (b)  General provisions. 
                  (1)  Purpose and intent. The purpose of this section is to protect the public health, safety, environment and general welfare through the regulation of non-stormwater discharges to the city/county storm sewer system to the maximum extent practicable as required by federal law. This section establishes methods for controlling the introduction of pollutants into the city/county storm sewer system in order to comply with requirements of the national pollutant discharge elimination system (NPDES) permit process.

                  Sec. 30-184. - Post-development stormwater management for new development and redevelopment. 
                  (a)  Introduction. It is hereby determined that: 
                  (1)  Land development projects and other land use conversions, and their associated changes to land cover, permanently alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, which in turn increase flooding, stream channel erosion, and sediment transport and deposition; 
                  (2)  Land development projects and other land use conversions also contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters; 
                  (3)  The impacts of post-development stormwater runoff quantity and quality can adversely affect public safety, public and private property, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters; 
                  (4)  These adverse impacts can be controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff quantity and quality from new development and redevelopment, by the use of both structural facilities as well as nonstructural measures, such as the conservation of open space and greenspace areas. The preservation and protection of natural area and greenspace for stormwater management benefits is encouraged through the use of incentives or "credits." The Georgia Greenspace Program provides a mechanism for the preservation and coordination of those greenspace areas which provide stormwater management quality and quantity benefits; 
                  (5)  Localities in the state are required to comply with a number of both state and federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of post-development stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution; 
                  Therefore, the city has established this set of stormwater management policies to provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of post-development stormwater runoff for the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation. It has determined that it is in the public interest to regulate post-development stormwater runoff discharges in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes, post-construction soil erosion and sedimentation, stream channel erosion, and nonpoint source pollution associated with post-development stormwater runoff. 
                  (b)  General provisions. 
                  (1)  Purpose and intent. The purpose of this section is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-development stormwater runoff and nonpoint source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment. It has been determined that proper management of post-development stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety, environment and general welfare of the public, and protect water and aquatic resources.

                  b.  Deterioration of existing culverts, bridges, dams, and other structures; 
                  c.  Accelerated stream bank or streambed erosion or siltation; 
                  d.  Degradation of in-stream biological functions or habitat; or 
                  e.  Water quality impairment in violation of state water quality standards, and/or violation of any state or federal regulations. 
                  (e)  Post-development stormwater management performance criteria. The following performance criteria shall be applicable to all stormwater management plans, unless otherwise provided for in this section: 
                  (1)  Water quality. All stormwater runoff generated from a site shall be adequately treated before discharge. It will be presumed that a stormwater management system complies with this requirement if: 
                  a.  It is sized to treat the prescribed water quality treatment volume from the site, as defined in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual; 
                  b.  Appropriate structural stormwater controls or nonstructural practices are selected, designed, constructed or preserved, and maintained according to the specific criteria in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual; and, 
                  c.  Runoff from hotspot land uses and activities identified by the city are adequately treated and addressed through the use of appropriate structural stormwater controls, nonstructural practices and pollution prevention practices. 
                  (2)  Stream channel protection. Protection of stream channels from bank and bed erosion and degradation shall be provided by using all of the following three approaches: 
                  a.  Preservation, restoration and/or reforestation (with native vegetation) of the applicable stream buffer; 
                  b.  24-hour extended detention storage of the 1-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event; 
                  c.  Erosion prevention measures such as energy dissipation and velocity control. 
                  (3)  Overbank flooding protection. Downstream overbank flood and property protection shall be provided by controlling (attenuating) the post-development peak discharge rate to the pre-development rate for the 25-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event. If control of the one-year, 24-hour storm is exempted, then peak discharge rate attenuation of the two-year through the 25-year return frequency storm event must be provided. 
                  (4)  Extreme flooding protection. Extreme flood and public safety protection shall be provided by controlling and safely conveying the 100-year, 24 hour return frequency storm event such that flooding is not exacerbated. 
                  (5)  Structural stormwater controls. All structural stormwater management facilities shall be selected and designed using the appropriate criteria from the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. All structural stormwater controls must be designed appropriately to meet their intended function. For other structural stormwater controls not included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual, or for which pollutant removal rates have not been provided, the effectiveness and pollutant removal of the structural control must be documented through prior studies, literature reviews, or other means and receive approval from the community development department before being included in the design of a stormwater management system. In addition, if hydrologic or topographic conditions, or land use activities warrant greater control than that provided by the minimum control requirements, the community development department may impose additional requirements deemed necessary to protect upstream and downstream properties and aquatic resources from damage due to increased volume, frequency, and rate of stormwater runoff or increased nonpoint source pollution loads created on the site in question. 
                  Applicants shall consult the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual for guidance on the factors that determine site design feasibility when selecting and locating a structural stormwater control. 
                  (6)  Stormwater credits for nonstructural measures. The use of one or more site design measures by the applicant may allow for a reduction in the water quality treatment volume required. The applicant may, if approved by the community development department, take credit for the use of stormwater better site design practices and reduce the water quality volume requirement. For each potential credit, there is a minimum set of criteria and requirements that identify the conditions or circumstances under which the credit may be applied. The site design practices that qualify for this credit and the criteria and procedures for applying and calculating the credits are included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. 
                  (7)  Drainage system guidelines. Stormwater conveyance facilities, which may include but are not limited to culverts, stormwater drainage pipes, catch basins, drop inlets, junction boxes, headwalls, gutter, swales, channels, ditches, and energy dissipaters shall be provided when necessary for the protection of public right-of-way and private properties adjoining project sites and/or public right-of-ways. Stormwater conveyance facilities that are designed to carry runoff from more that one parcel, existing or proposed, shall meet the following requirements:

If such activity results in land disturbance in the buffer that would otherwise be prohibited, then no other land-disturbing activity other than normal forest management practices will be allowed on the entire property for three years after the end of the activities that intruded on the buffer. 
                  After the effective date of this section, it shall apply to new subdividing and platting activities. 
                  Any land development activity within a buffer established hereunder or any impervious cover within a setback established hereunder is prohibited unless a variance is granted. 
                  (d)  Land development requirements. 
                  (1)  Buffer and setback requirements. All land development activity subject to this section shall meet the following requirements: 
                  a.  An undisturbed natural vegetative buffer shall be maintained for 50 feet, measured horizontally, on both banks (as applicable) of the stream as measured from the top of the stream bank. 
                  b.  An additional setback shall be maintained for 25 feet, measured horizontally, beyond the undisturbed natural vegetative buffer, in which all impervious cover shall be prohibited. Grading, filling and earthmoving shall be minimized within the setback. 
                  c.  No septic tanks or septic tank drain fields shall be permitted within the buffer or the setback. 
                  (2)  Variance procedures. Variances from the above buffer and setback requirements may be granted in accordance with the following provisions: 
                  a.  Where a parcel was platted prior to the effective date of this section, and its shape, topography or other existing physical condition prevents land development consistent with this section, and the city finds and determines that the requirements of this section prohibit the otherwise lawful use of the property by the owner, the city appeals board may grant a variance from the buffer and setback requirements hereunder, provided such variance require mitigation measures to offset the effects of any proposed land development on the parcel. 
                  b.  Except as provided above, the city appeals board shall grant no variance from any provision of this section without first conducting a public hearing on the application for variance and authorizing the granting of the variance by an affirmative vote of the city appeals board. The city shall give public notice of each such public hearing in a newspaper of general circulation within the city. The city shall require that the applicant post a sign giving notice of the proposed variance and the public hearing. The sign shall be of a size and posted in such a location on the property as to be clearly visible from the primary adjacent road right-of-way. 
                  c.  Variances will be considered only in the following cases: 
                  1.  When a property's shape, topography or other physical conditions existing at the time of the adoption of this section prevents land development unless a buffer variance is granted. 
                  2.  Unusual circumstances when strict adherence to the minimal buffer requirements in this section would create an extreme hardship. 
                  d.  Variances will not be considered when, following adoption of this section, actions of any property owner of a given property have created conditions of a hardship on that property. 
                  e.  At a minimum, a variance request shall include the following information: 
                  1.  A site map that includes locations of all streams, wetlands, floodplain boundaries and other natural features, as determined by field survey; 
                  2.  A description of the shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property; 
                  3.  A detailed site plan that shows the locations of all existing and proposed structures and other impervious cover, the limits of all existing and proposed land disturbance, both inside and outside the buffer and setback. The exact area of the buffer to be affected shall be accurately and clearly indicated; 
                  4.  Documentation of unusual hardship should the buffer be maintained; 
                  5.  At least one alternative plan, which does not include a buffer or setback intrusion, or an explanation of why such a site plan is not possible; 
                  6.  A calculation of the total area and length of the proposed intrusion; 
                  7.  A stormwater management site plan, if applicable; and, 
                  8.  Proposed mitigation, if any, for the intrusion. If no mitigation is proposed, the request must include an explanation of why none is being proposed. 
                  f.  The following factors will be considered in determining whether to issue a variance: 
                  1.  The shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property; 
                  2.  The locations of all streams on the property, including along property boundaries; 
                  3.  The location and extent of the proposed buffer or setback intrusion; and, 
                  4.  Whether alternative designs are possible which require less intrusion or no intrusion; 
                  5.  The long-term and construction water-quality impacts of the proposed variance; 
                  6.  Whether issuance of the variance is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment. 
                  (e)  Compatibility with other buffer regulations and requirements. This section is not intended to interfere with, abrogate or annul any other ordinance, rule or regulation, statute or other provision of law. The requirements of this section should be considered minimum requirements, and where any provision of this section imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall be considered to take precedence. 
                  (f)  Additional information requirements for development on buffer zone properties. 
                  (1)  Any permit applications for property requiring buffers and setbacks hereunder must include the following:

                  (g)  Responsibility. Neither the issuance of a development permit nor compliance with the conditions thereof, nor with the provisions of this section shall relieve any person from any responsibility otherwise imposed by law for damage to persons or property; nor shall the issuance of any permit hereunder serve to impose any liability upon the city, its officers or employees, for injury or damage to persons or property. 
                  (h)  Inspection. The city may cause inspections of the work in the buffer or setback to be made periodically during the course thereof and shall make a final inspection following completion of the work. The permittee shall assist the city in making such inspections. The city shall have the authority to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out its duties as prescribed in this section, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable time upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigating and inspecting the sites of any land development activities within the protection area. 
                  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent who requests entry for purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out official duties.

                  (a)  Purposes. 
                  (1)  To provide for the preservation of greenspace as a nonstructural stormwater runoff and watershed protection measure. 
                  (2)  To provide a residential zoning district that permits flexibility of design in order to promote environmentally sensitive and efficient uses of the land. 
                  (3)  To preserve in perpetuity unique or sensitive natural resources such as groundwater, floodplains, wetlands, streams, steep slopes, woodlands and wildlife habitat. 
                  (4)  To permit clustering of houses and structures on less environmentally sensitive soils which will reduce the amount of infrastructure, including paved surfaces and utility easements, necessary for residential development. 
                  (5)  To reduce erosion and sedimentation by minimizing land disturbance and removal of vegetation in residential development. 
                  (6)  To promote interconnected greenways and corridors throughout the community. 
                  (7)  To promote contiguous greenspace with adjacent jurisdictions 
                  (8)  To encourage interaction in the community by clustering houses and orienting them closer to the street, providing public gathering places and encouraging use of parks and community facilities as focal points in the neighborhood. 
                  (9)  To encourage street designs that reduce traffic speeds and reliance on main arteries. 
                  (10)  To promote construction of convenient landscaped walking trails and bike paths both within the subdivision and connected to neighboring communities, businesses, and facilities to reduce reliance on automobiles. 
                  (11)  To conserve scenic views and reduce perceived density by maximizing the number of houses with direct access to and views of open space. 
                  (12)  To preserve important historic and archaeological sites. 
                  (b)  General regulations. 
                  (1)  Applicability of regulations. This conservation subdivision option is available in the following districts; R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4 and R-6, as a use by right. Applicant shall comply with all other provisions of the zoning code and all other applicable laws, except those that are incompatible with the provisions contained herein. 
                  (2)  Ownership of development site. The tract of land to be subdivided may be held in single and separate ownership or in multiple ownership. If held in multiple ownership, however, the site shall be developed according to a single plan with common authority and common responsibility. 
                  (3)  Housing density determination. The maximum number of lots in the conservation subdivision shall be determined by either of the following two methods, at the discretion of the local jurisdiction: 
                  a.  Calculation: The maximum number of lots is determined by dividing the area of the tract of land by the minimum lot size specified in the underlying zoning. In making this calculation, the following shall not be included in the total area of the parcel: 
                  1.  Slopes over 25 percent of at least 5,000 square feet contiguous area;

The market value of the building means (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions, which have been identified by the code enforcement official. The term does also not include any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced.

                  Located within areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity flood waters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, floodways must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  (1)  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway, except for activities specifically allowed in subsection (2) below. 
                  (2)  Encroachments for bridges, culverts, roadways and utilities within the regulatory floodway may be permitted provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment will not result in any increase to the pre-project base flood elevations, floodway elevations, or floodway widths during the base flood discharge. A licensed professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof; and 
                  (3)  If the applicant proposes to revise the floodway boundaries, no permit authorizing the encroachment into or an alteration of the floodway shall be issued by the City of Riverdale until an affirmative conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) is issued by FEMA or a no-rise certification is approved by the City of Riverdale.

                  (11)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to, or contamination from, such systems during flooding. 
                  (12)  Other public utilities such as gas and electric systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them, or public safety hazards from them, during flooding. 
                  (13)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure which is not compliant with the provisions of this chapter, shall be undertaken only if the non-conformity is not furthered, extended or replaced. 
                  (14)  If the proposed development is located in multiple flood zones, or multiple base flood elevations cross the proposed site, the higher or more restrictive base flood elevation or future condition elevation and development standards shall take precedence. 
                  (15)  When only a portion of a proposed structure is located within a flood zone or the future-conditions floodplain, the entire structure shall meet the requirements of this chapter. 
                  (16)  Subdivision proposals and other proposed new development, including manufactured home parks or subdivisions, shall be reasonably safe from flooding: 
                  a.  All such proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage within the flood-prone area; 
                  b.  All public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage; and

                  Areas of special flood hazard may include designated "AO" shallow flooding areas. These areas have base flood depths of one to three feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. In these areas the following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and non-residential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to no lower than one foot above the flood depth number in feet specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade. Flood openings sufficient to facilitate automatic equalization of hydrostatic flood forces shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 38-19(e)(1); 
                  (2)  New construction and substantial improvement of a non-residential structure may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to the specified FIRM flood level plus one foot above the highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A licensed professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice, and shall provide such certification to the city manager or designee using the FEMA floodproofing certificate along with the design and operation/maintenance plan; and 
                  (3)  Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure.

                  Sec. 38-24.1. - Variance procedures. 
                  The following variance and appeals procedures shall apply to an applicant who has been denied a permit for a development activity, or to an owner or developer who has not applied for a permit because it is clear that the proposed development activity would be inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter: 
                  (1)  Requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter shall be submitted to the planning and zoning department. All such requests shall be heard and decided in accordance with procedures to be published in writing by the City of Riverdale. At a minimum, such procedures shall include notice to all affected parties and the opportunity to be heard. 
                  (2)  Any person adversely affected by any decision of the planning and zoning department shall have the right to appeal such decision to the board of appeals as established by the City of Riverdale in accordance with procedures to be published in writing by the board of appeals. At a minimum, such procedures shall include notice to all affected parties and the opportunity to be heard. 
                  (3)  Any person or persons jointly or severally aggrieved by any decision of the board of appeals may within 30 days after the filing of the decision in the office of the board, but not thereafter, seek review of such decision by the Superior Court of Clayton County by writ of certiorari. 
                  (4)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure, and the variance issued shall be the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (5)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this section are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (6)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (7)  In reviewing such requests, the board of appeals shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this chapter. 
                  (8)  Conditions for variances: 
                  a.  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  1.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
                  2.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  3.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, or the creation of a nuisance. 
                  b.  The provisions of this chapter are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore, any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
                  c.  Any person to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance resulting from the lowest floor elevation being placed below the base flood elevation will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property, and that such costs may be as high as $25.00 for each $100.00 of insurance coverage provided. 
                  d.  The city manager or designee shall maintain the records of all variance actions, both granted and denied, and report them to the Georgia Department of Natural Resources and the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (9)  Any person requesting a variance shall, from the time of the request until the time the request is acted upon, submit such information and documentation as the director and board of appeals shall deem necessary for the consideration of the request. 
                  (10)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this chapter, the board of appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as they deem necessary or appropriate, consistent with the purposes of this chapter. 
                  (11)  Variances shall not be issued "after the fact."

Among the circumstances which may be considered in determining whether such alarm is warranted is the fact that the actor takes flight upon appearance of a police officer, refuses to identify himself, or manifestly endeavors to conceal himself or any object. Unless flight by the actor or other circumstances make it impracticable, a police officer shall, prior to any arrest for an offense under this section, afford the actor the opportunity to dispel any alarm which would otherwise be warranted, by requesting him to identify himself and explain his presence and conduct.

                  (a)  A telephonic alarm system is an alarm system which is wired in such a way that activation of the alarm results in direct connection of the alarm with the lines of the fire department switchboard which are dedicated to public use. 
                  (b)  Telephonic alarm system does not include any alarm which: 
                  (1)  Contacts a control center which screens calls to eliminate false alarms before such calls are routed to the fire department; or 
                  (2)  Utilizes a dedicated line into the fire department which is not available for public use.

                  The city council finds that use of telephonic alarm systems constitute a hazard to public safety in that: 
                  (1)  Unscreened calls result in an abnormally high percentage of false alarms which require diversion of fire department personnel from legitimate calls, and lower overall response time; and 
                  (2)  By repeatedly dialing the fire department, such calls clog the department switchboard and prevent or delay city receipt of calls from elsewhere in the city.

                  (a)  Definition. A false alarm is any accident or occurrence wherein a private alarm system of any type is activated by any cause and which summons any public officer of the city to the location of such alarm, or which causes any public officer of the city to begin traveling en route to the location of such alarm, when there in fact exists no emergency or other condition requiring the presence of such officers. 
                  (b)  Excessive false alarms. It is declared by the city council that more than two false alarms in any one month, or more than six false alarms in any one year, is excessive and constitutes a danger to the public safety by hindering public safety officials from performing their necessary and proper functions. 
                  (c)  Fees for excessive false alarms. Any person who owns or occupies a building or lot upon which is located a private alarm system which experiences excessive false alarms, as defined above, shall be assessed a fee by the city for each false alarm over and above those defined as excessive in the amount set forth in the schedule of fees and charges. 
                  (d)  Imposition of fees. This fee is imposed as to whether the fire or police department received the alarm by direct connection or any other source, such as an answering service or modified central station. No fee is imposed by this section when the choice is made to notify the fire or police department directly by any person or in any situation. In determining whether an alarm is a false alarm, all circumstances shall be considered.

                  (Ord. No. 13-2011, § 1(Att. § 1), 6-29-11) 
                  Sec. 58-2. - Purpose and findings. 
                  (a)  Purpose. This chapter is enacted for the following purposes: 
                  (1)  To protect the rights of individuals and businesses to convey their messages through signs; 
                  (2)  To encourage the effective use of signs as a means of communication; 
                  (3)  To promote economic development; 
                  (4)  To improve traffic and pedestrian safety as it may be affected by distracting signs; 
                  (5)  To prevent the destruction of the natural beauty and environment of the city; 
                  (6)  To protect the public health, safety, and general welfare; 
                  (7)  To restrict the continued existence of abandoned or nonconforming signs unless in compliance with the terms of this section; 
                  (8)  To ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign standards; and 
                  (9)  To make it easy, quick and economically efficient to apply for a sign permit. 
                  (b)  Findings. 
                  (1)  The city finds that signs are a proper use of private property, are a means of personal free expression and a necessary component of a commercial environment. As such, signs are entitled to the protection of the law. In the absence of regulation, however, the number of such signs tends to proliferate, leading to cluttered and aesthetically blighted thoroughfares. In addition, the competition among competing sign owners for visibility of their signs contributes to safety hazards for both vehicles and pedestrians and undermines the sign owners' original purpose of presenting a clear message of its idea or identification of its premises. 
                  (2)  The city further finds that the regulation of the size, height, number and spacing of signs is necessary to protect the public safety, to assure compatibility of signs with surrounding land uses, to enhance the business and economy of the city, to protect the public investment in the streets and highways, to maintain the tranquil environment of residential areas, to promote industry and commerce, to eliminate visual clutter and blight, to provide an aesthetically appealing environment, and to provide for the orderly and reasonable display of signs for the benefit of all the city's citizens. 
                  (3)  The city further finds that there is a substantial difference between signs erected by public authority and signs erected by private citizens or businesses. Signs erected by public authority are virtually all erected for the purpose of maintaining the public safety either through direct control of traffic or through provision of such type signage as street signs which enable the traveling public to know where they are located and to find where they are going. As such, with the exception of signs identifying government buildings and advertising public events, virtually all government signs are erected purely for public safety purposes. Moreover, their use in the public right-of-way is necessary to ensure their visibility to the motoring public. The city finds that public utility signs are frequently of the same nature as those signs erected by governmental entities in that they provide necessary information to safeguard the public from downed power lines and from street excavations. Even where signs serve a propriety purpose, such as identifying markings on utility poles, those signs are marked primarily for the purpose of benefiting the public generally through identification of locations where there may be temporary losses of power. 
                  (4)  The city further finds that some signage has a single targeted function and that identification of such signage by description is impossible without referring to its function. For instance, address numerals are used for the sole purpose of locating addresses, which is of benefit to persons looking for those addresses and is essential to public safety personnel responding to emergencies. Subdivision signs at the entrances to subdivisions favor a similar purpose in enabling both the traveling public and emergency personnel to quickly locate subdivision entrances for the purpose of either visitation or responding to emergency calls. While such signage is often referenced based upon the function it serves within the context of this chapter, whenever possible, it is the intent of this chapter to refer to signs unrelated to the content of the speech provided and to allow maximum expressive potential to sign owners.

                  (a)  Incomplete application; false information. The director shall reject any application that is incomplete or inaccurate, that contains false material statements or omissions, or that is for a sign which would violate any standard within this chapter within 45 business days of receipt of said application.

If the hearing officer has not issued a decision within 15 days of the hearing date, the sign shall be deemed permitted "due cause" is the violation of the provisions of this chapter, state or federal law, or the submission of an incomplete application or an application containing false material statements. 
                  (c)  Appealable. 
                  (1)  An individual whose permit application has been denied may appeal the denial to the zoning board of appeals. An applicant whose permit has been revoked may appeal the decision of the hearing officer to the zoning board of appeals. 
                  (2)  Under either circumstance, the appellant must file written notice of an appeal with the department within ten business days of the denial or the revocation and pay the appropriate appeal fee as set forth in the schedule of fees and charges established from time to time by the city council.

                  (1)  Variances shall be limited to the minimum relief necessary to overcome the hardship. No variance shall be granted to allow a greater number of signs than would be allowed if the hardship did not exist. A variance from compliance with the sign regulations of this chapter shall be limited to the following hardship situations: 
                  (2)  Where, due to spacing requirements imposed under this chapter, the proximity of existing signs on adjoining lots causes permitted signs on the subject property to be ineligible; or 
                  (3)  Where visibility of a conforming sign from the public street and within 50 feet of the proposed sign would be substantially impaired by existing trees, plants, natural features, signs, buildings or structures on a different lot; and 
                  (4)  Placement of the sign elsewhere on the lot would not remedy the visual obstruction and the owner of the subject property did not create such visibility obstruction, and the variance proposed would not create a safety hazard to traffic. 
                  (b)  Timing. The board of zoning appeals shall hear and decide upon a variance within 60 days of the submission of a complete and accurate application.

                  A sign permit shall become null and void if the sign for which the permit was issued has not been installed and completed within 180 days after the date of issuance; provided, however, that where an applicant can demonstrate that an entity was timely engaged to construct the permitted sign, but the fabrication has not yet been completed, one 60-day extension may be granted by the director. No refunds shall be made for a permit after the permit is issued. If later an individual desires to erect a sign at the same location, a new application for the sign must be processed and another fee paid in accordance with the fee schedule applicable at such time.

                  (a)  Identification labels. With each sign permit, the director shall issue a sticker bearing a number sufficient to reference a valid permit for which the permit is issued. It shall be the duty of the permittee or his agent to affix such sticker to the sign in the lower right hand area so it is easily seen. The absence of a proper sticker shall be prima facie evidence that the sign has been, or is being, erected or operated in violation of the standards of this chapter. 
                  (b)  Inspection. The director or his/her designee shall inspect all existing signs in the city to determine if such signs conform to the standards of this chapter.

                  It is the policy of the city to encourage compliance of all signs within the city with the terms and requirements of this section. The city finds that nonconforming signs may adversely affect the public health, safety, and welfare of the city. Such signs may adversely affect the aesthetic characteristics of the city and may adversely affect public safety due to the visual impact of said signs on motorists and the structural characteristics of said signs. 
                  (1)  No conforming sign shall be permitted or erected on any lot which has located thereupon an existing nonconforming sign until the nonconforming sign has either been removed or brought into compliance with this section. 
                  (2)  Maintained. A nonconforming sign shall not be replaced by another nonconforming sign, except that the substitution or interchange of quality material panels, painted boards, or dismountable material on nonconforming signs shall be permitted as long as the nonconforming sign retains its grandfathering rights. All nonconforming signs shall be maintained in good repair, free from peeled paint, rust, missing panels, missing letters, etc. Minor repairs and maintenance of nonconforming signs shall be permitted. However, no structural repairs, changes in shape, size, or design shall be permitted except to make a nonconforming sign comply with all requirements of this section. 
                  (3)  Repairs; material change. Minor repairs and maintenance of nonconforming signs shall be permitted when the cost of such repair does not exceed 25 percent of the replacement cost of the existing sign, provided, however, that no structural repairs or changes in the size or shape of a nonconforming sign shall be permitted except to make the sign comply with the standards of this chapter. 
                  (4)  Grandfathering. Nonconforming signs may stay in place until one of the following conditions occurs: 
                  a.  The advertised business ceases at that location for a period of more than 90 days and/or the sign if not used for a period of more than 90 days; 
                  b.  The deterioration of the sign or damage to the sign makes it a hazard or renders it dilapidated, unsightly or unkempt; or 
                  c.  The sign has been damaged to such extent that more than minor repairs (greater than 25 percent of the replacement cost of the existing sign) or a material change is required to restore the sign. No structural repairs or change in shape or size shall be permitted except to make the sign comply with all standards of this chapter. 
                  d.  If the business or use for which the nonconforming sign(s) was installed is expanded or modified, and if the value of the expansion or modification exceeds 50 percent of the value of the existing improvements. The sign or signs shall be immediately brought into compliance with this chapter with a new permit secured therefore, or shall be removed. All improvements to a single business or use within any 12-month period shall be treated cumulatively in the administration of this subparagraph. 
                  (Ord. No. 13-2011, § 1(Att. § 20), 6-29-11) 
                  Sec. 58-21. - Removal of unlawful or dangerous signs. 
                  (a)  Removal. The city may order the removal of any sign in violation of this chapter by written notice to the permit holder, then to the owner of the sign; or if the sign owner cannot be found or cannot be determined, then to the sign erector and any party that procured the erection of the sign. If a permit has been issued, such notice shall operate to revoke the permit. 
                  (b)  Procedure following removal order. If the sign is not removed within the time allowable the city shall issue a citation to the appropriate person(s) and the matter will be heard in municipal court. 
                  (c)  Removal without notice. The city shall have removed any sign in violation of this chapter, without giving notice to any party, if: 
                  (1)  Said sign is upon the public right-of-way or upon other public property or upon the 
                  (2)  Pavement of a private street or drive; or 
                  (3)  Said sign poses an immediate safety threat to the life or health of any members of the public. 
                  If the city removes the sign, it shall have the right to collect all costs from the sign and/or property owner as set forth in subsection (d) below. 
                  (d)  Removal after court determination. Other than signs located in a public right-of-way, a sign shall be removed by the city after a final determination by a court that the sign is unlawful and should be removed. If the permittee or property owner fails to remove the sign, the sign may be immediately removed and disposed of by the city with all costs to be paid by the permittee or property owner. If permittee or property owner fails to pay within 30 days, a lien can be filed on said property for the incurred expenses.

                  Sec. 58-22. - Sign location. 
                  (a)  Obstructions to doors, windows, or fire escapes. No sign shall be erected, relocated, or maintained to prevent free ingress or egress from any door, window, or fire escape. 
                  (b)  Signs not to constitute traffic hazard. No sign or any part thereof, except authorized traffic signs, shall be located in any government right-of-way. 
                  (c)  Setback. Unless a more restrictive setback is specified in conditions of zoning or otherwise in this chapter, all signs shall set back at least ten feet from the right-of-way or 20 feet from the edge of pavement if a private street and no sign shall project over the right-of-way. Freestanding signs shall be a minimum of 25 feet from an intersection as measured from the intersection of the two rights-of-way and shall be a minimum of 35 feet from any other freestanding signs.

                  Sec. 58-23. - Measurement of sign area. 
                  (a)  Area. The area of a sign shall be computed as the area within the smallest continuous polygon comprised of not more than eight straight lines enclosing the limits of a sign face, together with any sign face cabinet or frame or material, texture, or color forming an integral part of the sign face used to differentiate the sign face from the structure upon which it is placed. If polygons established around wall signs located on the same street oriented wall are within 24 inches or less of one another, then the area of the sign shall be measured within one continuous polygon. 
                  (b)  Structure. The computation of the area of a sign face shall not include the structure, supports, or uprights on which the sign face is placed or any portions of a sign structure that are not intended to contain any message or idea and are purely structural or decorative in nature, other than those parts contained within the polygon that delineates the sign face. 
                  (c)  Changeable copy signs. For any signs on which the words, letters, figures, symbols, logos, fixtures, colors, or other design elements routinely change or are intended to be changed from time to time, the sign face area shall include the entire area within which any words, letters, figures, symbols, logos, fixtures, colors, or other design elements may be placed, together with any frame or material, texture or coloring forming an integral part of the sign face or used to differentiate the sign face from the structure upon which it is placed. Such changeable copy signs cannot flash, and if located within 150 feet of a road right-of-way, may not change more than once per 24 hours. 
                  (d)  Multi-faced signs. For multi-faced signs, when the sign face surfaces are parallel and are back to back, or where the interior angle formed by the faces is 45 degrees or less, the area of the sign shall be taken as the areas on the largest side. For all other multi-faced signs, the area of the sign shall be the total area on all sides that can be viewed at one time from any angle. 
                  (Ord. No. 13-2011, § 1(Att. § 23), 6-29-11) 
                  Sec. 58-24. - Measurement of sign height. 
                  The maximum base height of a freestanding monument sign shall not exceed three feet in height. The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the base of the sign structure at normal grade to the top of the highest attached component of the sign. Normal grade shall be construed to be the lower of: (1) existing grade prior to construction or (2) the newly established grade after construction, exclusive of any filling, beaming, mounding, or excavating solely for the purpose of locating the sign. 
                  In cases in which the normal grade cannot reasonably be determined, sign height shall be computed on the assumption that the elevation of the normal grade at the base of the sign is equal to the elevation of the nearest point of the crown of a public street or the grade of the land at the principal entrance to the principal structure on the zoned lot, whichever is greater (surveyor's certificate required). Where the normal grade is below the normal grade of a public street, the sign base can be raised to the elevation of the normal grade of the street before the height limitations are applied (surveyor's certificate required). At no time shall any sign's overall height exceed the zoning district's height limitations. 
                  (Ord. No. 13-2011, § 1(Att. § 24), 6-29-11)

                  (a)  Building and safety codes. All signs permitted under this code shall be constructed and maintained in accordance with the applicable city building and safety codes. The city may remove, after due notice, any sign which shows neglect or becomes dilapidated. 
                  (b)  Faces. The face of sign shall be flat, with protrusions of no more than two inches to allow for the texture of the sign and words, letters, figures, symbols, logos, fixtures, colors, or other design elements. No sign or other advertising structure shall be constructed so as to have nails, tacks, or wires protruding there from. Lettering for address signage shall not exceed eight inches in height or as required by the applicable building code. 
                  (c)  Design standards/materials. 
                  (1)  All ground signs shall be monument style signs. 
                  (2)  Signs shall be of quality design and craftsmanship. 
                  (3)  Identification monuments (except for the sign face) shall be constructed of brick, granite, stone, marble, or other natural material used in the principal building(s) on site. 
                  (4)  Identification monuments (except for the sign face and/or logo or trade name) shall be earth tones, not primary colors. 
                  (5)  Sign shape and lettering shall be limited as follows:

                  ARTICLE IV. - SPEED HUMPS 

                  Sec. 66-64. - Purpose. 
                  In response to an increasing number of complaints regarding speeding problems in residential neighborhoods, the city department of public works (the "department") has studied available alternatives and methods employed by other similarly situated communities and how effectively and successfully those communities have addressed residential speeding problems. The installation of speed humps was found to be a popular and relatively cost effective measure in reducing average speeds. When properly designed and installed, and with strong majority community backing and support, speed humps were found to be effective at reducing speeds in neighborhoods. After much experimenting and testing, including testing on city streets, the use of speed humps has been widely endorsed by transportation authorities. In the United States, a policy on the use of speed humps has been developed by a special committee of the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE). As a result of these preliminary efforts, the following procedures have been established for groups of citizens in the city who want to pursue the installation of speed humps in their neighborhoods. 
                  (Ord. No. 02-12, § 1, 7-8-02) 
                  Sec. 66-65. - Criteria for installation. 
                  The city will consider the installation of speed humps only on streets classified by the department as local residential streets. Traffic studies conducted by the department must find that a speeding problem exists based on a standard 85th percentile of at least 11 miles per hour over the posted speed limit. 
                  (Ord. No. 02-12, § 1, 7-8-02) 
                  Sec. 66-66. - Request for study; public hearing. 
                  An authorized officer of an organized homeowners' association or the majority of homeowners within a neighborhood may, through an informal petition or letter, request that a neighborhood be studied for the speed hump installation. The letter or petition must demonstrate that the desires of a majority of the property owners in that neighborhood are represented. The results of the neighborhood traffic speed study may be directed to the neighborhood representative by certified mail or, upon request, will be presented by the department to a neighborhood at a public hearing organized, arranged, and publicized by the neighborhood group along with a general presentation on speed humps. All property owners in the neighborhood shall be notified by an authorized representative of the neighborhood group of the time and place of the public hearing. 
                  (Ord. No. 02-12, § 1, 7-8-02) 
                  Sec. 66-67. - Petition for installation—Preparation. 
                  A formal petition in such form prescribed by the department shall be filed with the department requesting the installation of speed humps within the neighborhood. All property owners in the neighborhood shall be notified by an authorized representative of the neighborhood group and afforded an opportunity to sign the petition. Each property owner shall indicate his or her preference for the installation of neighborhood speed humps by marking a "YES" or "NO" on the petition. If more than one person owns the property, all parties shall sign the petition individually to be counted. Renting tenants are not an acceptable substitute for the legal property owner and may not sign petitions as related to this program. No valid signature will be withdrawn from the petition after it is filed with the department. Each person signing the petition shall sign before a witness who shall be available to verify the signature of a property owner. 
                  (Ord. No. 02-12, § 1, 7-8-02) 
                  Sec. 66-68. - Number of signatures required; filing. 
                  At least 75 percent of the property owners in a neighborhood must indicate an affirmative preference for speed humps before a petition will be considered by the department for recommendation to the city council. 
                  The percentages shall be calculated by dividing the total number of property owners by the total number of property owners indicating an affirmative preference. For purposes of determining the number of property owners in the neighborhood, the geographical boundaries of the neighborhood shall be established by the department using the database of the city's taxing authorities. In the event a neighborhood is not completely built out, a minimum of 30 percent of the total number of residences must be occupied before a petition for the installation of speed humps will be considered. The completed petition must state the name and address of the representative of the neighborhood group, it must be signed by the representative before a notary public and returned to the department where it will be checked against property tax records to insure that all requirements are met. Those petitions failing to meet specified requirements will be returned to the representative for compliance. Petitions meeting all requirements will be presented at the next regular city council business meeting for approval or disapproval by the council. 
                  (Ord. No. 02-12, § 1, 7-8-02) 
                  Sec. 66-69. - Construction; warnings posted. 
                  (a)  The geometric design of speed humps has been proven to be a critical factor in terms of their safety and effectiveness in lowering speeds. Based on extensive research, speed humps shall be constructed with the following specifications: Four inches maximum vertical rise, 22 feet in horizontal length, and six foot incline-ten foot flattop-six foot decline. 
                  (b)  Each individual speed hump location shall require posting of standard warning signs that will be installed along the back of the curb within the city-owned rights-of-way as well as pavement markings as outlined in section 3B.26 of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices as approved by the Federal Highway Administration. 
                  (Ord. No. 02-12, § 1, 7-8-02) 
                  Sec. 66-70. - Procedure for removal. 
                  The city shall remove speed humps under the following conditions: 
                  (1)  A formal petition in the form as prescribed in section 66-67 above shall be filed with the department indicating that 75 percent of the property owners request the removal of the speed humps; 
                  (2)  The petition shall contain a statement acknowledging that the property owners are aware of the probability that vehicular traffic speeds within the neighborhood may increase after the speed humps are removed; 
                  (3)  The speed humps shall not have been installed less than one year from the date of receipt of the petition; and 
                  (4)  All costs associated with the initial installation and the removal of the speed humps, as determined and itemized by the department, shall have been paid. 
                  In the event a neighborhood is not completely built out, a minimum of 60 percent of the total number of residences must be occupied before a petition or the removal of speed humps will be considered. 
                  (Ord. No. 02-12, § 1, 7-8-02) 
                  Sec. 66-71. - Charges for installation, maintenance, and removal; length of time for installation. 
                  All property owners in a petitioning neighborhood shall pay for the installation and maintenance of the speed humps. The charge associated with the initial installation, maintenance, and repair of speed humps shall be a minimum of $24.00 per property, per year. The charge associated with the removal of speed humps shall be at a level that adequately covers the cost of removal as determined by the department. All rates may be subject to change to reflect material and labor increases to the city and will be posted with the schedule of fees as adopted by the mayor and council. The installation of the speed humps shall be completed, weather permitting, in approximately four months or less from the date the petition is approved by the city council. 
                  (Ord. No. 02-12, § 1, 7-8-02) 
                  Sec. 66-72. - Collection; enforcement as a lien. 
                  The charges for installation, maintenance, and removal of speed humps shall be in the form of an assessment against the property and shall be itemized as a separate entry, and added annually to each property owner's property tax statement. The assessment shall constitute a lien upon the property and have the same priority as an ad valorem tax lien.

                  a.  Generally. In determining the amount of occupation tax to be levied on an individual business or practitioner, the city classifies all businesses or practitioners by the same combination of criteria: Gross receipts of the business or practitioner in combination with the profitability ratio for the type of business, profession or occupation as measured by nation-wide averages derived from statistics, classifications or other information published by the United States Office of Management and Budget, the United States Internal Revenue Service or successor agencies of the United States. 
                  b.  Specifically. An occupation tax shall be levied based upon the gross receipts of the business or practitioner in combination with the profitability ratio for the type of business, profession or occupation as measured by nationwide averages utilized by the city. Each type of business shall be assigned to a profit class based on the profitability ratio for that business type. The occupational tax rate levied will be based on the profit class of the dominant line of the business as defined by the standard industrial classification system. Gross receipts shall be defined as set forth in section 68-31. The tax rate determined by profitability ratios in combination with gross receipts for each business, trade, profession or occupation shall be as follows and will be developed and updated annually by the city based on variables of changing budget requirements and gross receipts. A detailed example of calculations used to formulate the occupational tax schedule can be obtained from the city upon request.

                  b.  In no instance shall the sum of the portions of the total gross receipts of a business or practitioner taxed by all local governments exceed 100 percent of the total gross receipts of the business or practitioner.

                  d.  Upon request, businesses or practitioners with a location or office situated in more than one jurisdiction shall provide to the city the following: 
                  1.  Financial information necessary to allocate the gross receipts of the business or practitioner; and

                  (f)  Inclusion of administrative fee. 
                  (1)  A nonprorated, nonrefundable administrative fee as set forth in the schedule of fees shall be required on all occupation tax accounts for the initial startup, renewal or reopening of those accounts.

                  (1)  The city hereby levies a tax at a rate of 2.5 percent upon the gross direct premiums of all foreign, alien and domestic insurance companies doing business in the city other than life insurance companies.

The tax is levied upon premiums derived from policies insuring persons, property or risks in the state from January 1 to December 31, both inclusive, of each year without regard to business ceded to or assumed from other companies. The tax is imposed upon gross premiums received during the preceding calendar year from direct writing without any deductions allowed from premium abatement of any kind or character or for reinsurance or for losses or expenses of any kind; provided, however, deductions shall be allowed for premiums returned or change of rate or canceled policies; provided, further, that deductions shall be permitted for returned premiums or assessments, including all policy dividends, refunds, or other similar returns paid or credited to policyholders.

                  c.  1.  On March 1, 1984, and on the same date in each subsequent year, each insurance company upon which a tax is imposed by subsection (b)(2) of this section shall file a certified return on a form prescribed by the commissioner showing gross direct premiums received during the preceding calendar year that will appear in the company's certified annual statement.

                  d.  The total amount of premiums taxable by the state on insurance companies as defined in this section shall be allocated to each county unincorporated area and each municipal corporation based upon a fraction, the numerator of which is the population of the unincorporated area or municipal corporation and the denominator of which is the total population of the state.

                  (a)  Occupation taxes levied on business to be transacted during calendar year; filing of returns showing gross receipts during preceding calendar year. 
                  (1)  All occupation taxes levied by this article are levied on amount of business to be transacted during the calendar year. However, for convenience of both city and the taxpayer and the necessity of making numerous returns, those businesses subject to the occupation tax shall, on or before the times set forth in this article, file with the revenue collection officer the returns specifically provided for in this section, showing the gross receipts of that business during the preceding calendar year. This return shall be used as an estimate for making payments on the occupation tax for current calendar year, the actual and final amount of tax levied for business transacted in a current calendar year to be paid in accordance with a final return to be made after the termination of the year, in accordance with the procedure set forth in this article. 
                  (2)  The owner, proprietor, manager or secretary officer or the business subject to such occupation tax of the current calendar year shall, at the end of the preceding year and on or before May 1 of the current calendar year, file with the revenue collection officer, on a form furnished by the revenue collection officer, a signed return, setting forth the amount of gross receipts of such business for the entire preceding calendar year, to be used as an estimate of the gross receipts for the current year. 
                  (3)  Where a business subject to the occupation tax for the calendar year has been conducted for only a part of the preceding year, the amount of gross receipts for such part shall be set forth in such return. Such return shall also show a figure putting the receipts for such part of a year on an annual basis, which figure shall bear the same ratio to the amount of gross receipts for such part year as the full year bears to such part. Such figure shall be used as the estimate of the gross receipts of the business for the current calendar year. 
                  (b)  Payment of occupation tax by newly established business. In the case of a business subject to occupation tax for a calendar year, which was not conducted for any period of time in the corporate limits of the city in the preceding year, the owner, proprietor, manager or executive officer of the business liable for occupation tax shall estimate the gross volume of revenue from commencing date to the end of the calendar year.

                  (2)  If the amount of the occupation tax for the preceding year based on the return provided for in this section and on the rate of the tax provided for in this article exceeds the amount of occupation tax theretofore paid by such business based on the estimate filed pursuant to section 68-41, the difference in such amount shall be due and payable by the taxpayer to the city on May 1 or the current year and delinquent if not paid on or before such date. 
                  (3)  If the amount of the occupation tax for the preceding year, based on the return provided for in this section and on the rate of tax provided for in this article, is less than the amount of occupation tax theretofore paid by such business based on the estimate filed pursuant to section 68-41, the difference in such amount shall be refundable by the city to the taxpayer; or if such business continues to be conducted in such city during the current year, such difference in amount may be credited by the city on the amount of occupation tax to be paid to the city by such business for the current year. 
                  (d)  Returns confidential. 
                  (1)  Except as provided in O.C.G.A. § 48-13-15(c), information on gross receipts received by a business or practitioner of an occupation or profession provided to the city for the purpose of determining the amount of occupation tax for the business or practitioner is confidential and exempt from inspection or disclosure under article 4 of chapter 18 of title 50. 
                  (2)  Violation of the confidentiality provision of subsection (a) of this section shall be unlawful and upon conviction shall be punished as a misdemeanor. 
                  (3)  Information on gross receipts received by a business or practitioner of an occupation or profession provided to the city for the purpose of determining the amount of occupation tax for the business or practitioner may be disclosed to the governing authority of another local government for occupation tax purposes or pursuant to court order or for the purpose of collection of occupation tax or prosecution for failure or refusal to pay occupation tax. 
                  (4)  In the event a taxpayer completes one or more forms in order to comply with the city's ordinance imposing either an occupation tax or a regulatory fee and any such form fails to disclose the Social Security number or the appropriate federal or state taxpayer identification number, or other identification numbers, the city shall report the omission in a timely manner to the state revenue commissioner.

Failure of submission of such books or records within 30 days shall be grounds for revocation of the occupation tax permit currently existing to do business in the city. If, after examination of the books or records, it is determined that a deficiency occurs as a result of under reporting, interest at the maximum rate allowed by law will be assessed for the period delinquent. If, after subsequent examinations of the books or records, it is determined that a deficiency occurs as a result of under reporting, then a penalty of ten percent and interest at the maximum rate allowed by law shall be assessed as per O.C.G.A § 48-2-40. 
                  (b)  Upon demand by the community development department, it shall also be the duty of any person holding an occupation tax permit from the city to furnish, during regular business hours at the person's place of business, all books of account, invoices, papers, reports and memoranda containing entries showing amount of purchases, sales receipts, inventory and other information, from which the correct business tax classification of the business may be ascertained and from which the correct amount of tax to which the business is subject may be determined, including exhibition of bank deposit books, bank statements, copies of sales tax reports to the state, copies of state income tax reports and federal income tax reports.

                  (d)  Except in the case of judicial proceedings or other proceedings necessary to collect the occupation tax levied and assessed, it shall be unlawful for any officer, employee, agent or clerk of the city or any person to divulge or make known in any manner the information required to be submitted or examined under the terms of this section and the rules and regulations promulgated in connection therewith.

                  b.  The failure to file properly the application and schedule on or before March 1 of a calendar year in which the taxes are due shall constitute a waiver of the exemption on the part of the applicant failing to make the application for such exemption for that year.

                  a.  The exemptions granted pursuant to this section shall extend and apply to those properties the legal title to which is vested in one or more titleholders if actually occupied by one or more of such owners as a residence.

In such instances, the city shall give notice of its intent to deny the exemption, and the surviving spouse may make application for the amount of homestead exemption to which such applicant is entitled within 30 days from the date of the notice by the city. In the case of a base year assessed value homestead exemption, as long as the surviving spouse otherwise meets the requirements specified for such exemption and makes proper application under this subsection, upon approval of such application the exemption shall be continued with the same base year assessed value as had been established for the deceased spouse of such surviving spouse, unless otherwise provided by local law.

                  b.  The applicant has the right to appeal the determination to the Clayton County Superior Court. Any such appeal must be filed within 30 days after the final determination by the city. Any such appeal is a de novo proceeding.

                  2.  Make any false statement or false representation of a material fact in support of a claim for exemption; or 
                  3.  Assist another knowingly in the preparation of any false or fraudulent claim for exemption or enter into any collusion with another by the execution of a fictitious deed, deed of trust, mortgage or otherwise. 
                  b.  Any person who violates this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. In addition, the property shall be taxed in an amount double the tax otherwise to be paid.

                  "Certain persons are eligible for certain exemptions from ad valorem taxation.

                  (a)  Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms have the following meanings: 
                  Delinquent taxpayer means the person or persons against whom an execution has been issued or the successor in title to the property for which the execution has been issued. 
                  Due diligence means the performance of a diligent search to ascertain the actual location of the record owner of the property. The following actions shall satisfy the diligent search requirements of this section: sending notice by first-class mail, certified mail or statutory overnight delivery, as required by law. If the notice is returned undelivered the following actions shall satisfy the diligent search requirements of this section: due diligence shall include checking telephone directories for the county wherein the property is located; checking the records of the tax commissioner of the county wherein the property is located; or checking the real estate records of the clerk of the superior court of the county wherein the property is located. 
                  Execution means an execution issued for the collection of any ad valorem taxes, special assessments, fees, penalties, interest or collection costs due to the city. 
                  Transferee means a person to whom an execution is transferred. 
                  Transferor means the official holding the tax executions and authorized to collect or transfer such tax executions. 
                  (b)  Executions for unpaid ad valorem taxes. 
                  (1)  Issuance of executions. 
                  a.  For any and all unpaid ad valorem taxes during any year, executions shall be issued against the property and the owners thereof on or after November 15 of each year for the amount of taxes due, the interest thereon and such fee for the issuance of the execution as provided by law. Such execution shall be issued by the city clerk and bear teste in the name of the mayor and shall be levied by the chief of police or any other police officer of the city. Such execution shall bind all the property, real and personal, of the defendant and the costs thereof shall be the same as on tax collector's executions by the laws of this state. 
                  b.  The execution shall be levied by the chief of police or any other police officer of the city, upon such property as in the discretion of the levying officer may be suitable or available for such purposes, and the same shall be advertised once a week for four weeks next preceding the date of sale in the official organ of Clayton County or in a newspaper having general circulation in the city. 
                  (2)  Time in which to enforce. All city tax executions, before or after legal transfer and record, shall be enforced within seven years from: 
                  a.  The date of issue; or 
                  b.  The time of the last entry upon the tax execution by the officer authorized to execute and return the execution if the execution and entry are properly entered or reentered upon the execution docket or books in which executions issued on judgments and entries on executions issued on judgments are required to be entered or reentered. 
                  (3)  Transfer of executions. 
                  a.  Whenever any person other than the person against whom an execution has been issued pays an execution issued for city taxes or special assessments, the officer whose duty is to enforce the execution may transfer the execution to the party so paying the full value of the execution. No officer whose duty it is to enforce an execution issued for city taxes or special assessments shall be required to make any transfer or transfers of such execution or executions. The transferee shall have the same rights as to enforcing the execution and priority of payment as might have been exercised or claimed by the tax official. The person to whom the execution is transferred shall, within 30 days of the transfer, cause the execution to be entered on the general execution docket of the superior court of the county in which the execution was issued. In default of the required entry or entries, the execution shall lose its lien upon any property which has been transferred in good faith and for a valuable consideration before the entry and without notice of the existence of the execution. 
                  b.  The transfer of executions shall be governed by O.C.G.A. § 48-3-19. 
                  (c)  Tax sales. 
                  (1)  Rules governing tax sales. 
                  a.  The sale of real or personal property under a tax execution shall be made in the same manner as provided for judicial sales; provided, however, that in addition to such other notice as may be required by law, in any sale under a tax execution, the defendant shall be given 20 days' written notice of such sale by registered or certified mail or statutory overnight delivery. The notice required by this section shall be sent to the defendant's last known address as listed in the records of the city. A copy of the notice shall also be sent to the appropriate tax official of the state, county or municipality that also has issued an execution with respect to such property. 
                  b.  Sales of such property shall be conducted on the first Tuesday of the month before the door of the city hall or in the council chambers between the hours of 10:00 a.m. and 11:00 a.m. All property shall be sold at public outcry to the highest bidder for cash. 
                  c.  If, during any sale of property by the city for taxes due and after the property has been offered a reasonable time, no one present at the sale bids an amount for the property being sold which is as much as the total of the tax due plus the officer's cost due on the sale, then any duly appointed officer or agent of the city may purchase the property for the city. If the city purchases property at a sale, the officer conducting the sale shall make to the city a deed to the property sold and shall deliver the deed to the officer designated by the city to receive it. Title acquired by the city at a tax sale by a deed issued pursuant to the sale shall be as perfect, valid and binding, after the period provided for redemption by the owner has elapsed and there is no redemption by the owner, as if purchased by any person other than the city. The officer conducting the sale shall put the city, through any person the city designates, in possession of the property so sold. 
                  d.  Property acquired by the city pursuant to subsection (3) may be divested or alienated by the city only by public sale of the property to the highest bidder. However, when it is clearly shown to the city that returned or unreturned property has been sold and purchased by the governing authority to protect both the taxes of the city and the cost of collecting such taxes and that the governing authority has not parted with title to the property, the city may quitclaim the property by unanimous vote to the owner of the property at the time of purchase by the city or to the owner's administrators, executors, heirs or assigns upon payment of all taxes which are due on the property and all costs due by reason of the sale. 
                  e.  The recitals in a deed under a sale for city taxes shall be prima facie evidence of the facts recited in the deed. 
                  f.  When an execution is placed in the hands of the selling officer of the city with written notice to retain the proceeds arising from the sale of any property of the defendant in fi. fa., the selling officer, after first paying to the city the amount due on the process under which the sale was made, shall retain the balance of the funds in his hands until he is ordered by the court first acquiring jurisdiction under proper proceedings to pay out the funds. 
                  g.  If two or more executions have been levied against a defendant, or if two or more in rem executions have been levied against the same unreturned property, such executions may be aggregated and a single sale may be conducted for the total amount due as in the case of a single execution, and the 12-month period of redemption provided by O.C.G.A. § 48-4-40 shall commence as to all such executions on the date of such sale. 
                  h.  In advertisements for sales under tax executions, the property being sold may alternatively be described by tax parcel identification number and current street address, if any, together with a reference to the recording information for any deed conveying title to such property, without the necessity of using a full and complete description of the property. 
                  i.  One who is obligated to pay a tax on property cannot strengthen his title by purchasing the property at a tax sale. Each such purchase shall be treated as payment for the tax due. 
                  (2)  Excess; how paid; unclaimed funds. 
                  a.  If there are any excess funds after paying taxes, costs and all expenses of a sale, the officer selling the property shall give written notice of such excess funds to the record owner of the property at the time of the tax sale and to the record owner of each security deed affecting the property and to all other parties having any recorded equity interest or claim in such property at the time of the tax sale. Such notice shall be sent by first-class mail within 30 days after the tax sale. The notice shall contain a description of the land sold, the date sold, the name and address of the tax sale purchaser, the total sale price and the amount of excess funds collected and held by the city. The notice shall state that the excess funds are available for distribution to the owner or owners as their interests appear in the order of priority in which their interests exist. 
                  b.  The city may file, when deemed necessary, an interpleader action in superior court for the payment of the amount of such excess funds. Such excess funds shall be distributed by the superior court to the intended parties, including the owner, as their interests appear and in the order of priority in which their interests exist. The cost of litigation such an interpleader action, including reasonable attorney's fees, shall be paid from the excess funds upon order of the court. 
                  c.  After five years have elapsed from the tax sale date, the city shall pay over to the state any excess unclaimed funds and for which no action or proceeding is pending in a claim for payment. Once excess funds are placed in the possession of the state, only a court order from an interpleader action filed in the county where the tax sale occurred, by the claimant for the funds, shall serve as justification for release of the funds. 
                  (d)  Redemption. 
                  (1)  Whenever any real property is sold under or by virtue of an execution issued for the collection of city taxes, the defendant in fi. fa. or any person having any right, title or interest in or lien upon such property may redeem the property from the sale by the payment of the redemption price or the amount required for redemption, as fixed and provided in O.C.G.A. § 48-4-42. 
                  a.  At any time within 12 months from the date of the sale; and 
                  b.  At any time after the sale until the right to redeem is foreclosed by the giving of the notice provided for in O.C.G.A. § 48-4-45. 
                  (2)  When property has been redeemed, the effect of the redemption shall be to put the title conveyed by the tax sale back into the defendant in fi. fa., subject to all liens existing at the time of the tax sale. If the redemption has been made by any creditor of the defendant or by any person having any interest in the property, the amount expended by the creditor or person interested shall constitute a first lien on the property and, if the quitclaim deed provided for in O.C.G.A. § 48-4-44 is recorded as required by law, shall be repaid prior to any other claims upon the property.

               <head>Chapter 69 - TELECOMMUNICATION TOWERS AND ANTENNAS </head>
               <p>                  ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

                  Sec. 69-1. - Purpose, findings and goals. 
                  (a)  The purpose of this chapter is to balance the interests of residents, visitors and business owners of the city with the competing interests of providers of telecommunication services. This chapter establishes guidelines for the siting of telecommunication towers and antennas and the facilities to which such towers and antennas are affixed so as to promote the health, safety, order, prosperity and general welfare of the city within the framework imposed by Telecommunications Act of 1996. 
                  (b)  The mayor and council for the city expressly take legislative notice of the deleterious impact of towers and antennas on the aesthetic and monetary value of properties, and in particular residential and scenic properties, from which such towers and antennas are visible. The goals of this chapter, therefore, are to: 
                  (1)  Ensure, to the extent practicable, that new antennas are affixed to towers, buildings and other suitable structures already in existence and that construction of additional towers and alternative tower structures be considered only as a last resort; 
                  (2)  Encourage the location of towers in non-residential areas and minimize the total number of towers throughout the community; 
                  (3)  Encourage strongly the joint use of new and existing tower sites (co-location); 
                  (4)  Encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them, to the extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the community is minimal; 
                  (5)  Encourage users of towers and antennas to construct them in a way that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers or antennas; 
                  (6)  Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from structural failure through engineering and careful siting of tower structures; 
                  (7)  Minimize danger to children and others who might attempt to climb or play on antennas, monopoles or towers; 
                  (8)  Develop an inventory of existing sites and telecommunication facilities with specific information regarding ownership, licenses, users, structural capacity, transmission and reception capacity, contract conditions affecting co-location, and undeveloped land area; and 
                  (9)  Provide for the disposition of towers not in use.

                  Sec. 69-2. - Definitions. 
                  As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings ascribed to them: 
                  Alternative tower structure means any structure that functions as a tower as defined herein that is designed so as to camouflage or conceal the presence of antennas and other communication equipment, such as man-made trees, clock towers, bell steeples, light poles and similar alternative designs. 
                  Antenna means any exterior apparatus designed for telephonic, radio, or television communications through the sending and/or receiving of electromagnetic waves. 
                  Co-location means the placement of the antennas of two or more service providers upon a single tower or alternative tower structure. 
                  Community development director means the community development director for the City of Riverdale, Georgia. 
                  FAA means the Federal Aviation Administration. 
                  FCC means the Federal Communications Commission. 
                  Guy tower means a tower that is supported, in whole or in part, by guy wires and/or ground anchors. 
                  Height, when referring to a tower, antenna or other structure, means the distance measured vertically from the highest point when positioned for operation to the lowest point, which is defined as the average ground elevation along the structure being measured at either roof or ground level, whichever is applicable. The height of a tower shall include the height of any antenna positioned for operation attached or which may be attached to the highest point on the tower. 
                  Lattice or self-supporting tower means a tower that has open-framed supports on three or four sides and is constructed without guy wires and ground anchors. 
                  Monopole tower means a telecommunication tower consisting of a single pole, constructed without guy wires or ground anchors. 
                  Preexisting, when used to modify antenna, monopole or tower, means any such structure for which a city building permit has been properly issued prior to the effective date of this chapter. 
                  Telecommunication facility means a telecommunication tower, a monopole tower, an antenna or any and all buildings, structures or other supporting equipment used in connection with a telecommunication tower, a monopole tower, an antenna or used in connection or associated with transmitting and receiving communication frequencies.

                  Sec. 69-3. - Applicability. 
                  The requirements set forth in this chapter shall govern antennas, monopoles, towers, support structures and other equipment used in connection or associated with transmitting and receiving communication frequencies ("telecommunication facilities") which exceed the height limitations specified for structures in each zoning district. The height limitations specified for each zoning district shall not apply to antennas, monopoles, towers or other equipment associated with transmitting and receiving communication frequencies.

                  ARTICLE II. - PREFERRED AND DISFAVORED LOCATIONS 

                  Sec. 69-4. - Installation on existing towers or monopoles (co-location preferred). 
                  (a)  No new telecommunication tower or structure shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the city that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna. An existing tower or structure will be presumed to "accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna" as required above if such tower or structure is currently being used for transmitting and/or receiving analog, digital, microwave, cellular, telephone, personal wireless service or similar forms of electronic communication regardless of the underlying zoning designation of the site; provided, however, that the location of the tower or structure meets the design and siting requirements of this chapter. 
                  (b)  Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna may consist of any of the following: 
                  (1)  No existing tower or structures are located within the geographic area required to meet applicant's engineering requirements; 
                  (2)  Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to meet applicant's engineering requirements. 
                  (3)  Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment; 
                  (4)  The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the existing towers or structures, or the antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the applicant's proposed antenna; 
                  (5)  The fees or costs required to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower or structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development are presumed unreasonable; 
                  (6)  Property owner or owners of existing towers or structures are unwilling to reasonably accommodate the applicant's needs; or 
                  (7)  The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render existing towers and structures unsuitable. 
                  (c)  Antennas may be installed on existing towers of any height so long as the addition adds no more than twenty (20) feet to the height of the existing tower, subject to all applicable zoning district restrictions, the provisions contained herein as well as the requirements of all other applicable restrictions, codes and ordinances. 
                  (d)  If it is adequately demonstrated that antenna co-location, as required in this chapter, is not possible for a given geographic area, the following use may be permitted after the city reviews the evidence: 
                  (1)  Constructing a new tower, including the placement of additional buildings or other supporting equipment used in connection with such tower or antenna within a geographical business district previously designated, authorized and approved by the city to specifically serve as an alternative district for the location of new towers in the event co-locations are not possible, if any such districts have been so designated. Provided, however, that all structures shall meet the setback, screening, buffer, height, size and other requirements contained herein as well as the requirements of all other applicable, restrictions, codes and ordinances; or 
                  (2)  Installation of an antenna on an existing structure other than a tower (such as a building, sign, light pole, water tower, or other free-standing nonresidential structure) that is 50 feet in height or greater, so long as the additional antenna height adds no more than 20 feet to the height of the existing structure, subject to all applicable zoning district restrictions, the provisions contained herein as well as the requirements of all other applicable restrictions, codes and ordinances. 
                  (e)  At no time will any co-location site be allowed to become an "antenna farm" or otherwise be deemed by the zoning commission to be visually obtrusive. 
                  (f)  Co-location tower specifications. The location of any tower that a qualified professional engineer certifies can accommodate the ultimate number of shared users proposed by the applicant, and that the city concludes is in conformity with all other requirements, must meet the following height and usage criteria: 
                  (1)  For a single user, up to 70 feet in height; 
                  (2)  For two users, up to 100 feet in height; and 
                  (3)  For three or more users, up to 130 feet in height. 
                  (Ord. No. 10-2007, § 1, 8-13-07) 
                  Sec. 69-5. - Other preferred location sites. 
                  (a)  Publicly-used structures. Publicly-used structures are preferred locations throughout the city because they appear in virtually all neighborhoods, are dispersed throughout the city and, due to their institutional or infrastructure uses, are generally similar in appearance to or readily adaptable for other smaller telecommunications facilities. Therefore, antennae should be less noticeable when affixed to publicly used structures, such as police or fire stations, libraries, community centers, civic centers, courthouses, utility structures, water towers, elevated roadways, bridges, flag poles and schools, than when placed on commercial or residential structures. 
                  (b)  Industrial and commercial structures. Wholly industrial and commercial structures, located in zoning districts permitting telecommunication facilities, such as warehouse factories, retail outlets, supermarkets, banks, garages or service stations shall be preferred locations particularly where existing visual obstructions or clutter on the roof or along a roof line can and will be removed as part of the installation of the telecommunications facility. 
                  (c)  Alternative structures. Installation on existing alternative structures such as electric transmission towers or billboards, or construction of alternative structures appropriate to the proposed location context such as bell towers, church steeples or flagpoles.

                  (15)  The site plan meets the following requirements for principal, accessory and joint uses: 
                  a.  Accessory structures used in direct support of a tower are not used for offices, vehicle storage or other outdoor storage. Mobile or immobile equipment not used in direct support of a tower facility are not stored or parked on the site of the tower, except to the extent that such equipment is necessary to repair or maintain the facility while repair or maintenance is continuing; 
                  b.  Towers located on sites containing another principal use in the same buildable area comply with siting, set back, separation, and general requirements of this section. Towers may occupy a leased portion of a premises where the leased portion allows for the minimum set back and spacing requirements for the zoning district in which it is located. When joint use of a lot is permitted, the city shall require the execution of a unity of title if two or more lots are utilized for setback purposes or to prohibit the unlawful division of a lot containing a tower and another principal use. The minimum distance between a tower and other principal use located on the same lot shall be the greater of 100 percent breakpoint of the tower or 150 feet. This separation is required to assure compatibility of land uses and to provide for the health, safety and welfare of individuals and structures occupying the same site; and 
                  c.  Towers are not located on property where volatile, flammable, explosive or hazardous materials such as propane, gasoline, natural gas and dangerous chemicals are stored, transferred, sold or placed. 
                  (16)  No advertising is permitted on telecommunications facilities. However, an antenna installation may be allowed on any legally permitted permanent billboard or outdoor advertising sign as long as the other requirements of this chapter are met.

                  (1)  The monopole tower is not greater than 150 feet in height (the council may allow up to 30 feet in additional height for each co-location opportunity made available on each tower, up the maximum height allowed by the council for each particular location, according to the circumstances thereof); 
                  (2)  The monopole tower is made of wood or, if made of steel, the monopole maintains a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, is painted a neutral color so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness; 
                  (3)  The monopole tower displays no advertising; 
                  (4)  The monopole tower is not artificially lighted unless required by the FAA or other governmental authority for safety purposes. Where required, the city shall review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views; 
                  (5)  The monopole tower meets or exceeds current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC and any other governmental agency with the authority to regulate telecommunication facilities. If such standards and regulations are changed, the owner of the monopole shall bring such monopole into compliance with any revised standards and regulations within six months of the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a more stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling agency. Failure to comply with this provision shall be grounds for the city to require removal or re-permitting of the antenna at the owner's expense; 
                  (6)  The applicant demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the city that no existing telecommunication facility can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna; 
                  (7)  The monopole tower meets the following setbacks and separation requirements: 
                  a.  Monopole towers are set back from any adjoining residentially zoned property a distance of 200 feet; 
                  b.  Monopole towers have a front yard setback of 60 feet, and sufficient rear and side yard setbacks to fully contain the structure in the event of monopole failure; and 
                  c.  Monopole towers over 40 feet in height are located no less than one-quarter mile from any existing telecommunication tower or monopole that is over 50 feet in height; 
                  (8)  The monopole tower is equipped with an anti-climbing device to prevent unauthorized access; 
                  (9)  The monopole tower complies with all current safety, design, structural and wind loading standards of applicable building and technical codes adopted by the City, so as not to endanger the health and safety of residents; and 
                  (10)  Accessory or principal uses. 
                  a.  Accessory structures used in direct support of a monopole shall be allowed but not used for offices, vehicle storage or other outdoor storage. Mobile or immobile equipment not used in direct support of a monopole shall not be stored or parked on the site of the monopole, unless repairs to the monopole are being made; 
                  b.  Monopoles may be located on sites containing another principal use in the same buildable area. As long as all of the other siting, set back, separation and general requirements of this chapter are met, monopoles may occupy a leased parcel on a site meeting the minimum lot size requirements for the zoning district in which it is located. When joint use of a lot is permitted, the city shall require the execution of a unity of title if two or more lots are utilized for set back purposes or to prohibit the unlawful division of a lot containing a monopole and another principal use. The minimum distance between a monopole and other principal use located on the same lot shall be the greater of 60 feet or the 100 percent breakpoint of the monopole. This separation is required to assure compatibility of land uses and to provide for the health, safety and welfare of individuals and structures occupying the same site.

If the owner fails to bring the telecommunication facility into compliance within said 45 days, the city may proceed with the removal of such facility pursuant to the provisions of the City Code and place lien upon the property for the costs of such removal. 
                  (e)  If, upon inspection or upon receipt of an engineer's report submitted pursuant to subparagraph (a) above, the community development department determines that a telecommunication tower, antenna or monopole has not been utilized by any user for a continuous period of 12 months, such tower, antenna or monopole shall be considered abandoned, and the owner shall remove the same within 90 days of written notice of such determination of abandonment. If the tower, antenna or monopole is not removed within said 90 days, the city may proceed with the removal of such facility pursuant to the provisions of the City Code and place a lien upon the property for the costs of such removal.

The decision as to the suspension or revocation of the license shall be made in writing by the municipal court judge after a hearing pursuant to section 23 of the city Charter. 
                  (b)  Periodic inspection.

If such act, omission or violation is done by an agent, servant, employee, or officer of the licensee, the lack of knowledge on the part of the licensee or the lack of authorization for such act or omission or violation shall be no defense. 
                  (2)  The entry of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, or the conviction of any licensee, partner, or any officer, director or stockholder of a licensee corporation with respect to a charge of violation of any of the laws of the United States or of the state relating to vehicle immobilization services. 
                  (3)  Any course of conduct or activity on the premises with respect to the operation of a business licensed hereunder which the city shall find to be contrary to the public interest, and of sufficient duration to constitute a nuisance or which shall render the licensee or the business location unfit for the continued operation of the business. 
                  (f)  No new license to be issued after revocation. When a license has been revoked under the provisions of this article, no application for a new license from the same licensee shall be granted for a period of 24 months.

                  A yard fence shall not be placed any closer to a street than the front building line setback of any lot. In the case of corner lots the fence shall meet both setbacks. 
                  It shall be unlawful to erect a fence or wall without first obtaining a permit to do so from the director of community development and general services department.

                  ARTICLE VI. - NON-CONFORMING USES 

                  Sec. 6.1. - Continuance of non-conforming uses (grandfather clause). 
                  The lawful use of any building or structure or land existing at the time of the enactment or amendment of this ordinance (sometimes referred to as a legal non-conforming use or a grandfathered use) may be continued, even though such use does not conform with the provisions of this ordinance, except that the non-conforming use shall not be: 
                  1.  Extended to occupy a different or greater area of land. 
                  2.  Extended to occupy a greater area of any building or structure unless such additional area of the building or structure existed at the time of the passage of amendment of this ordinance and was clearly designed to house the same use as the non-conforming use occupying the other portion of the building or structure. 
                  3.  Re-established after discontinuance for six months. Discontinuance of a non-conforming use for six months or more shall constitute evidence of intent to abandon legal nonconforming status as defined herein. 
                  4.  Changed to another or different non-conforming use. 
                  (Ord. of 4-28-2008) 
                  Sec. 6.2. - Illegal nonconforming and legal nonconforming. 
                  A structure or lot which was constructed or is being used without an approved building permit, certificate of occupancy, or approval from the city is considered illegal nonconforming. An illegal nonconforming property shall be subject to actions and penalties allowed by this code and all other applicable laws and shall be altered to conform to all applicable standards and regulations of this ordinance. 
                  Legal nonconforming differs from illegal nonconforming in that the reason for the nonconformance is caused by the enactment of a zoning code or a change to the zoning code (including the official zoning map). The structure, lot or use has not changed, but due to the zoning code enactment or change, the property no longer conforms to the policies and standards of the zoning district in which it is located. When this situation occurs, the property is deemed legal nonconforming or "grandfathered." See section 6.1. 
                  Use of a portion of a lot shall not establish a nonconformity as to the entire lot, but only to that portion of the lot actually used at the time of the enactment or amendment of this ordinance.

                  Any nonconforming building or any building containing a nonconforming use, which has been damaged by fire or other cause, may be rebuilt and used as before if such reconstruction is completed within one year of such damage. However, if such building or structure has been damaged to an extent exceeding 50 percent of its replacement cost at the time of such damage or destruction, as determined by the building inspector, any repair, reconstruction, or use of such building or structure shall be in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance. 
                  (Ord. of 4-28-2008) 
                  Sec. 6.4. - Exemptions due to state or county action. 
                  Whenever a parcel of land becomes nonconforming as a result of land acquisition by the city, county or state, building permits shall be granted to new construction provided the proposed structure complies with all but lot area requirements, and setback requirements shall be reduced without requirement for a variance to the extent of the width of the acquired property.

In the case of a corner lot, no vehicles may be parked or stored in the side yard on the street side of the lot. No such equipment shall be used for living, sleeping, or housekeeping purposes when parked or stored on a residential lot, or in any location not approved for such use.

                  7.  Noise. No business, trade, profession or occupation shall qualify as a home occupation if the pursuit of such generates noise which is audible beyond the property lines of the property upon which the premise is located.

                  The regulations contained in this article are intended to: promote the orderly future development of Riverdale; discourage the size and type of development which would create excessive requirements and costs for public services; discourage uses which because of their size or type would generate abnormal amounts of traffic on minor streets; and protect and promote a suitable environment for family life. 
                  Specific land uses are either permitted, prohibited or permitted only as a conditional use in each zoning district as provided herein. Except as otherwise provided, any use not specifically permitted in a zoning district as provided by this Code or approved as a conditional use through the provisions of this Code, shall be prohibited in that district.

                  8.5.4-1. Description of district: This district is established to provide for the compatible transition from residential development to limited commercial development at selected locations within the city. 
                  In order to assure compatibility between new commercial development and adjacent/surrounding residential uses, supplemental minimum area provisions for commercial development within the C-T district require that each proposed commercial development have a minimum of 125 feet of frontage on a public street and that such development have a minimum land area of 20,000 square feet set aside and exclusively devoted to such individual development. 
                  Exceptions to these minimum public street frontage and/or minimum land area requirements may be granted by the mayor and council only in those instances where it can be shown that previous commercial development precludes the possibility of assembling sufficient land to meet the minimum requirements. The minimum street frontage and/or land area do not apply when existing residential buildings are converted to commercial use, provided adjoining properties are zoned commercial. In conversions, the city council shall specify any improvements, interior and exterior, required prior to occupancy for a business use. 
                  Exterior wall materials shall be one or more of the following: 
                  (A)  Hard-burned clay brick.

Units shall be those generally described by the National Concrete Masonry Association as "customized architectural concrete masonry units" or shall be broken faced brick-type units with marble aggregate. There shall be no exposed concrete block on the exterior of any building; however, rear walls which do not front any street or building may be painted concrete block. Any concrete masonry units that have a gray cement color shall be coated with a coating approved by the director of community development and general services department. 
                  (D)  Concrete may be poured in place, tilt-up or pre-cast. Poured-in-place and tilt-up walls shall have a finish of stone, a texture or a coating. Textured finishes shall be coated. Precast units which are not uniform in color shall be coated. Coating shall be an approved cementitious of any epoxy type with a life expectancy of at least ten years. 
                  (E)  Conversion of residential buildings shall be undertaken only with the approval of the city council and subject to requirements they approve. 
                  Applications for rezoning and/or development under the C-T district provisions shall include a site plan.

                  8.6.1. MPMUD, master planned mixed use district 
                  8.6.1-1. District intent: The "MPMUD" district is intended to provide for planned mixed-use development. Uses must complement and be compatible with the orderly development of the project as well as surrounding land uses. MPMUDs may be developed in distinct pods (development sites) or can be integrated with a mix of uses being interspersed with one another, including multiple uses within the same structure. The density of residential development and intensity of nonresidential development should be consistent with the Riverdale Comprehensive Plan. 
                  MPMUDs must contain well landscaped streets, open spaces, parks and quality architecture that give unique character and image. MPMUDs should also promote multi-path trail connectivity and enhancement of pedestrian environment and experience. 
                  Application for rezoning to MPMUD will not be accepted or considered by the City of Riverdale until the Town Center Architectural Overlay District is adopted as part of this ordinance. 
                  8.6.1-2. Land uses: 
                  (A)  Generally. Uses shall provide an orderly relation and function to other uses in the development and to existing land uses, as well as with due regard to the comprehensive plan. Development within the district may be limited to those uses specifically requested as part of the MPMUD rezoning application and approved by the mayor and city council, unless otherwise specifically limited by the mayor and city council in its approval of the MPMUD rezoning application. 
                  (B)  Commercial, office, and institutional uses. A MPMUD shall consist of commercial (retail and/or service) uses, and it shall consist of either office or institutional land uses, or both (i.e., institutional is not a requirement) as specified in this ordinance. Commercial, office, and institutional land use calculations shall be calculated by square feet per acre of building space for the total project acreage (i.e., the entire land area within the MPMUD). 
                  (C)  Residential uses. A MPMUD shall consist of residential uses. Residential land use calculations shall be calculated on the basis of units per acre for the total project acreage (i.e., the entire land area within the MPMUD). 
                  (D)  Open space. MPMUDs shall require a minimum of 30 percent of the total project acreage in open space, as defined in this ordinance. Mayor and council may require any or all of the open space be preserved in perpetuity by a deeded conservation easement or similar approved document owned by the city, a homeowners association and/or a similar body acceptable to the City of Riverdale. 
                  (E)  The following uses are permitted within a MPMUD district:

                  8.6.1-8. Criteria for approval. In considering and acting upon applications for rezoning to MPMUD, the planning commission and the mayor and council shall consider and base their recommendation and decision on the requirements and considerations of this ordinance. However, the planning commission and the mayor and council will additionally consider the extent to which the proposal is consistent with the purpose and intent, criteria, and requirements of this article. 
                  In instances where the MPMUD rezoning application does not meet the criteria provided in this article, director of community development and general services department may recommend, and the mayor and council may approve, conditions of zoning in order for the rezoning application and resulting development to comply completely or more fully with these criteria. 
                  8.6.1-9. Amendments. 
                  (A)  Conformance to approved master development plan. All further development of the property shall conform to the approved master development plan, regardless of any change in ownership, unless the City of Riverdale approves minor or major amendments. 
                  (B)  Minor amendments. The director of community development and general services department may approve minor amendments to the approved master development plan, which are in compliance with the provisions and intent of this ordinance, and do not depart from the principal concept of the approved master development plan. Minor amendments are those determined by the director of community development and general services department to meet the purpose and intent of the MPMUD, which would not affect adjacent properties. Minor amendments may be approved as part of the land disturbance permitting process. The director of community development and general services department shall require the applicant to provide written justification for minor amendments. Minor amendments shall not include adjustments to approved permitted uses or the approved mix of land uses in the master development plan approved by the mayor and city council. 
                  (C)  Major amendments. Should the director of community development and general services department determine that a requested change or deviation from the approved master development plan departs from the principles of the master planned plan and/or would affect adjacent properties, or would change the approved mix of land uses, the proposed modification will be classified as a major amendment. The applicant may apply to the director of community development and general services department for approval of a major amendment by the mayor and council through standard zoning procedures. 
                  8.6.1-10. Residential density bonus. In recognition of the community's desire for preservation of open space, a residential density bonus of 0.1 unit per acre (calculated on the entire MPMUD land area) may be given for each percentage increase above the 30 percent minimum required open space (calculated on the entire MPMUD land area), not to exceed an additional one unit per acre maximum. For instance, if a development provides 35 percent open space, then the density bonus would be 0.5 units per acre. In no event shall an MPMUD exceed six units per acre. 
                  8.6.2. RMX mixed use district 
                  8.6.2-1. District intent The "RMX" District is intended to:

                  8.6.3. TCMU Design Standards and Guidelines. 

                  8.6.3-1. Introduction. 
                  In 2006, the City of Riverdale was the recipient of a Livable Centers Initiative (LCI) Grant aimed at helping foster greater livability, mobility, and accessibility. The city seized on this opportunity to plan for a "New Riverdale". The LCI effort focused on the creation of a new "Town Center" to include a City Civic Center complete with a City Hall building, Community Center and Amphitheater (Phase I), supported by a mixed-use commercial, office, and retail space as well as residential housing (Phase II). 
                  The Construction of Phase I of the civic components of the "New Town Center" was completed in October of 2010. In order to lay the ground work for the development of Phase II of the Town Center and other private development projects, the city recognizes that it is critical to establish guidelines and regulations to ensure a good quality livable sustainable environment, which aligns with the vision of the city and its residents. 
                  8.6.3-2. Overall objective. 
                  The purpose of these design guidelines is to eliminate the ambiguity and uncertainty for the development community and ensure consistent environment and character. The overall objective of the design standards is to have a village atmosphere that is a safe, convenient, energetic, and attractive live, work, and play environment through the integration of uses and eclectic architecture. Therefore, the following building and design standards integrate land use, urban design, transportation, and architecture that make up the built environment, which address the following: 

                   
                  8.6.3-3. Applicability. 
                  These Design Standards and Guidelines apply to all proposed development within the Town Center Mixed-Use District that is subject to plan approval. The planning commission, at its discretion, can approve minor deviations from the design standards if, in its opinion, such deviations contribute to the goals articulated in section 8.6.3-6 more effectively than literal compliance with specific requirements. Applicants should clarify how proposed deviations further the goals of the town center as defined by the guiding principles. These design standards do not exempt applicants from obtaining all required permits and complying with all applicable building codes, laws, and regulations in force. 
                  8.6.3-4. Definitions. 
                  Definitions in the City of Riverdale Zoning Code apply to these Design Standards and Guidelines. 
                  8.6.3-5. Application requirements. 
                  Application for development within the district shall comply with the application requirements set forth in the City of Riverdale Zoning Code and shall include all information noted below: 
                  (a)  Completed application form, 
                  (b)  Development narrative including all uses, breakdown of square footage for each use, number of housing units and zoning summary, 
                  (c)  Location map with lot identification, 
                  (d)  Existing site plan, including all existing structures, trees, topography, and easements, prepared by a licensed surveyor, 
                  (e)  Certified list of abutters, 
                  (f)  Photos of adjacent properties and other properties impacted by the development project, 
                  (g)  Proposed site plan, indicating project boundaries, building footprints, onsite and remote parking areas (where applicable), and topography, 
                  (h)  Building plans - all levels including roof, 
                  (i)  Building elevations - all sides including courtyards and interior lot elevations, 
                  (j)  Massing perspective sketches or renderings illustrating the key elements of the development proposal within its context, 
                  (k)  Proposed exterior lighting plan with photometric information, 
                  (l)  Proposed storm water management plan with runoff calculations. 
                  The documents shall clearly differentiate between existing and proposed work by use of screened lines or color. Changes and revisions to subsequent submittals shall be prominently noted. 
                  8.6.3-6. Guiding principles. 
                  8.6.3-6.1. Support mixed use development. 
                  The City of Riverdale has historically contained a mix of uses: residential, office, retail, transit, and governmental—that all contribute to the community center character. New mixed-use development should contribute to the overall mix of uses within the district to and support architectural design that marks Riverdale's identity. New residences, restaurants, and commercial development will bring people to downtown to shop, live, work, and engage in civic and cultural activities. Mixed-use development will add to the employment, residential, commercial and cultural opportunities and enrich the varied societal life of the Town Center Mixed-Use District. Together they create the livable and vibrant communities that the "Smart Growth" district is intended to promote. 
                  8.6.3-6.2. Reinforce broader town goals to enliven the downtown. 
                  New development should enhance the character of the City of Riverdale and its community amenities, including sidewalks, crosswalks, street trees, lighting, and pedestrian oriented spaces, and it should use these improvements to make connections to open spaces, public buildings and public transportation. 
                  8.6.3-6.3. Balance unity and variety and create legibility. 
                  These design standards are intended to ensure that new buildings are compatible with the existing town center. It is in the city's interest to promote variety as well. The creative use of forms, materials and unique uses that give vitality to Riverdale's center is encouraged. Legibility of spaces is especially encouraged - a clear definition of public, semi-public, semi private, and private zones; residential, retail, commercial and public uses; usable open spaces and enclosed building volumes; and vehicular and pedestrian areas. 
                  8.6.3-6.4. Promote sustainable development. 
                  Sustainable construction techniques and materials should be incorporated in new construction in the district. New buildings should seek to improve energy efficiency within the building. Water conservation and energy efficiency should be a central goal in the selection of building components and building systems. 
                  8.6.3-7. Building design standards. 
                  8.6.3-7.1. Massing. 
                  8.6.3-7.1.1. Front façade setback. 
                  A minimum of 60 percent of front façades at ground level shall be located at the minimum setback line to reinforce the street line. When the space between the façade and setback line is specifically designed for pedestrian uses, such as outdoor dining, the maximum setback shall be permitted. Stepped back portions of the front façade at ground level are encouraged to articulate entries and provide variety. 

                  8.6.3-7.1.2. Building step-back requirements. 
                  The front and rear façades of four story buildings shall step back a minimum of five feet from the primary building face at either the second or fourth floor levels over 50 percent of their length, or offer alternative strategies for scaling the building height to the pedestrian must be offered. Where buildings abut a residential district, the side yard step-back shall be such that the maximum building envelope is bounded by a line projected from the property line at a 1 to 2 ratio (63.4°). 
                  8.6.3-7.1.3. Mixed use buildings shall use proportions to give legibility to building uses including cornices to complete the building composition, a change in materials acknowledging a change in use, larger windows that are open the first floor to the street, a step-back at upper stories reduces building mass, a band course reinforces building proportions, a smaller upper floor window contrasting with larger public size of ground floor windows, a taller first floor reinforces the public zone, and sheltered entries enrich the pedestrian zone. 

                  8.6.3-7.1.4. Minimum required side setback yard, zero. In order to achieve a continuous front building edge in the district, side yards between adjoining buildings shall be minimized to the greatest extent possible. 
                  8.6.3-7.1.5. Individual buildings should use human-scaled/pedestrian oriented architectural features. Individual buildings should clearly articulate the first story and primary entrances, with display windows encouraged for retail stores. The ground floor should be clearly delineated from the upper stories and the upper floors from the top of the front façade roof line. Large blank walls in pedestrian areas greater than 35 feet in length and large monolithic box-like structures should be avoided. Larger buildings should be designed to divide the mass of the facility to create a visual impression of a series of smaller buildings or sections. Windows, doors, shutters, columns, masonry detailing, and variations in the front roof line, building wall recesses and variations in colors and exterior materials should be used to break up the mass of a single building. 
                  8.6.3-7.1.6. A principal building shall be oriented to address and be nearly parallel to a primary street (nearly parallel means within 15 degrees of being parallel).

                  8.6.3-7.2. Appearance. 
                  8.6.3-7.2.1. Projecting bays, recesses, and cornices are encouraged at all floor levels to define proportions noted above. Building façades over 40 inches in length are required to have a change in plane articulated by projecting or recessed bays, balconies, or setbacks. 
                  8.6.3-7.2.2. Horizontal elements such as belt courses, projecting cornices, canopies, and step backs should be combined with vertical elements such as recesses, projecting bays, parapets and vertically aligned windows. Projected elements two feet and less may be located within the setback areas. 
                  8.6.3-7.2.3. Façade elements shall continue around to all sides of buildings visible from the street. Elements can be simplified at the rear of buildings to clarify a front/back hierarchy. 
                  8.6.3-7.2.4. Rooftop mechanical equipment shall be set back from building façades so that it is not visible from street views, screened from view behind parapets or enclosed within architectural elements that integrate it into the building design. Screening elements shall incorporate sound control devices or construction that mitigates equipment noise. Roofs shall not be visible from street views, except that mansard roofs may be used at the top floor of three or four story buildings.

Windows shall be spaced and grouped logically, smaller upper floor windows shall contrast with larger public size of ground floor windows, vertical upper story windows shall contrast with horizontal lower story windows, and larger windows shall exist on the lower level to the street. 

                  8.6.3-7.4.2. Ground floor commercial and retail uses shall be a minimum of 60 percent glass. The view into the first floor commercial or retail windows shall be maintained with a view into the sales floor or seating area. View windows shall not be blocked. Merchandise displays shall not include full-height backdrops that block the view. Transom windows above view windows and doors are encouraged. Upper floor residential and commercial uses shall have relatively less glass area to emphasize the public nature of the street-front uses. Glass shall be clear, or reflective only to the extent that such reflectivity reduces interior heat. Mirror glass is not permitted. No appliqués or other such deliberate screening shall be permitted. Signage on glass shall be as permitted in the Sign Ordinance. 
                  8.6.3-7.4.3. Upper story windows are generally smaller than storefront windows at street level, are spaced at regular intervals and give scale and texture to the street edge formed by building façades: For any new installation or replacement of upper story windows, the new/replacement windows shall be clear/non-tinted glass. Windows shall not be blocked, boarded up, or reduced in size, unless otherwise required by code for securing a vacant structure. At least 25 percent of the second and third floor building frontages (as measured from floor to ceiling) shall be window glass. 
                  8.6.3-7.4.4. Protecting ground floor fenestration and defining commercial street fronts with overhanging awnings or canopies is encouraged. Operable windows and doors onto balconies and terraces at upper floor uses are encouraged.

Prohibited materials include vinyl siding and EIFS, although these materials may be used on façades not visible from the primary commercial streets provided such materials are detailed and installed in such a manner as to be consistent with the intent of these Design Standards and Guidelines. 
                  8.6.3-7.5.3. Changes in materials are encouraged to reinforce the massing requirements noted above. When change in material or colors occur, they shall articulate the difference between public and private uses, upper floors and lower floors. 
                  8.6.3-7.5.4. Materials shall continue around to all sides of buildings, which are visible from the street or public parking areas. Elements can be simplified at the rear of buildings to clarify a front/back hierarchy. 
                  8.6.3-7.5.5. Blank façades are not permitted. Changes in material, which are accompanied by a change in plane, vertical and/or horizontal elements shall be used to provide a pedestrian scale in areas where windows and doors are not functionally required.

                  (a)  A four-foot high solid curved masonry or stone wall; or a four-foot high metal tube or solid metal bar fence located at the street right-of-way line (property line), with or without masonry pier supports, with a minimum five-foot wide landscaped area along either side of the fence. 
                  (b)  The landscaped area shall be planted with three evergreen shrubs and one deciduous shade tree per 30 feet of frontage. In the case where the landscaping is provided on the street side of the fence, the fence may be set back three feet from the right-of-way line to allow for the required landscaping. 
                  (c)  A corner opening is recommended for fenced in parking lots to allow a pedestrian walk through. A fence run shall be terminated by turning the corner and tapering the fence down. 
                  (d)  Curbing is recommended instead of wheel stops within the parking lot. 
                  8.6.3-8.5.12. Interior parking lot landscaping in which more than ten parking spaces are required the following shall be provided: One landscaped island or peninsula (162 square feet in area at least nine feet in width) for every ten parking spaces or portion thereof, unpaved, but concrete curbed, filled with suitable topsoil and covered with either grass, groundcover, or mulch. No less than one shade tree shall be provided in each landscaped island or peninsula. Shrubs should be planted to effectively screen parked cars. Planting intervals should result in the elimination of gaps between shrubs within two and one-half years. Shrubs should be tall enough to screen headlights. Any parking lot landscaping provided shall be maintained in good order. All plant materials shall be watered, fertilized, pruned, kept free from weeds and litter, and replaced if diseased, injured, or dead, consistent with good horticultural practices. 
                  8.6.3-8.6. Lighting. 
                  8.6.3-8.6.1. Façade lighting and architectural lighting shall articulate building uses and entries and reinforce the public nature of the sidewalk and building frontage. 
                  8.6.3-8.6.2. Lighting along street fronts shall reinforce rather than compete with the continuity of the city's street lighting. If the sidewalk includes street trees, streetlights shall be located between the trees so that the tree canopy does not interfere with illumination coverage. 
                  8.6.3-8.6.3. Lighting in parking areas and at the side and rear of buildings abutting adjoining properties should be designed to cut off light at the property line. 
                  8.6.3-8.6.4. Lighting should contribute to public safety by lighting entries, exits, and adjacent open spaces and pedestrian access to parking areas.

                  8.6.3-8.8.1. Storm water management systems shall incorporate "Best Management Practices" (BMP) as prescribed by the US Department of Environmental Protection Agency, in addition to employing Low Impact Development (LID) strategies. BMP/LID means and methods should be carefully integrated within the site design approach with a goal of decentralizing storm water management systems to the greatest extent practical and minimizing environmental impact of new development. The specific goals of the BMP/LID measures should be mitigation of post-development downstream impacts and achieving the highest level of water quality for all storm water runoff.

                  It is the intent of this article that all buildings, structures and uses of land shall provide off-street parking and loading space in an amount sufficient to meet the needs caused by the building or use of land and that such parking and loading spaces be so that they are in fact readily usable for such purposes. 
                  Each use of land and each building or structure hereafter constructed or established, shall provide off-street parking and loading according to the standards set forth herein. When an addition is made to a building containing less than the required parking or loading requirements, a conforming amount of parking or loading shall be supplied based upon the size of the addition. No addition to an existing building shall be constructed which reduces the number of spaces, area or usability of existing parking or loading spaces unless such building and its addition conform with the regulations for parking and loading contained herein. 
                  Parking spaces for the handicapped shall be required and shall be located as close as possible to elevators, ramps, walkways and entrances. Existing uses providing off-street parking shall have 12 months from the date of adoption of this ordinance to comply with handicapped parking requirements. New uses providing off-street parking shall incorporate handicapped spaces into the design of parking facilities.

                  ARTICLE XI. - BUFFER AND LANDSCAPING REQUIREMENTS 

                  Sec. 11.1. - Buffer requirements. 
                  It is recognized that the location of commercial or industrial land uses directly adjacent to single-family, two-family or multiple-family residential uses can create an incompatible situation. Additionally, the location of two-family or multiple-family residential land uses or manufactured home parks directly adjacent to single-family residential land uses can be an incompatible situation. Accordingly, in commercial and industrial districts, when a principal structure is expanded or modified, a planted screening buffer shall be provided along all side and rear property lines contiguous with a single-family residential district. The city council may require a similar buffer strip between other districts and land uses deemed to be incompatible. 
                  (Ord. of 4-28-2008) 
                  Sec. 11.2. - General requirements. 
                  A planted buffer strip is required to protect residential land uses from excessive heat, dust, wind, light, spill, unsightly views, odor and other characteristics commonly associated with commercial and industrial land uses and related vehicular and pedestrian traffic, which can adversely impact the quality of residential life. The required buffer shall provide necessary visual and acoustical privacy for the conduct of residential lifestyles in a pleasing environment, and shall provide for the protection and preservation of property values in residential districts. The density of buffers should take precedence over width of buffer. 
                  Required buffers shall be established and maintained by the developer and owner of the incompatible (less restrictive) land use. The required buffer must: 
                  1.  Be depicted in detail (the type and locations of natural and planted vegetation are to be illustrated) on each site plan prior to approval.

                  2.  Major variances: To authorize upon appeal in specific cases such major variances as defined in this ordinance from the terms of the ordinance as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of the ordinance will, in an individual case, result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of the ordinance shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. The existence of a nonconforming use of neighboring lands, buildings or structures in the same or other districts shall not constitute a reason for a variance. A variance may be granted in an individual case of necessary hardship upon a finding by the board of appeals that all of the following conditions exist: 
                  (a)  There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape or topography that are not applicable to other lands or structures in the same districts. 
                  (b)  A literal interpretation of the provisions of this ordinance would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties of the district in which the property is located. 
                  (c)  Granting the variance requested will not confer upon the property of the applicant any special privileges that are denied to other properties of the district in which the applicant's property is located. 
                  (d)  The requested variance will be in harmony with the purpose and intent of this ordinance and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or to the general welfare. 
                  (e)  The special circumstances are not the result of the actions of the applicant. 
                  (f)  The variance requested is the minimum variance that will make possible the legal use of the land, building or structure. 
                  (g)  The variance is not a request to permit a use of land, buildings or structures which is not permitted by right in the district involved. 
                  3.  Limitations on authorization of variances: As defined in this article, a variance may only be authorized for the following requirements of this ordinance: 
                  (a)  Height of structure. 
                  (b)  Area of structure as measured by the exterior footprint of the structure. 
                  (c)  Lot size requirements. 
                  (d)  Amount of front, rear and side yard setbacks. 
                  (e)  Size of open spaces (greenspace) not to include buffers. 
                  A variance may not be granted to establish or expand a use otherwise prohibited. Presence of nonconformities in the zoning district or uses in an adjoining zoning district shall not be the sole cause for granting a variance under this section.

                  ARTICLE VI. - GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF DESIGN 

                  Sec. 6.1. - Suitability of the land. 
                  Land subject to flooding, improper drainage, erosion, or otherwise deemed by the planning commission to be topographically unsuitable for residential use shall not be platted for residential occupancy; nor shall such land be platted for any other uses as may continue such conditions or increase danger to health, safety, life or property unless steps are taken to eliminate the above-mentioned hazards. 
                  Sec. 6.2. - Access. 
                  (6.2.1) Every subdivision shall be served by a publicly dedicated street. 
                  (6.2.2) When land is subdivided into parcels larger than ordinary building lots, such parcels shall be arranged and designed so as to allow for the opening of future streets and to provide access to those areas not presently served by streets. 
                  (6.2.3) No subdivision shall be so designated [designed] as to completely eliminate street access to adjoining parcels of land. 
                  Sec. 6.3. - Conformance to the master plan. 
                  (6.3.1) All proposed subdivision shall conform to the master plan at the time of plat submission to the planning commission. 
                  (6.3.2) In subdivisions related to or affecting any state or federal highway the approval of the State Highway Department of Georgia may be required by the planning commission. 
                  (6.3.3) When features of the master plan such as school sites, parks, collector streets, major streets and other public spaces are located in whole or in part in a proposed subdivision, or when these features have not been anticipated by the master plan but are considered essential by the planning commission, such features shall be reserved by the subdivider. Whenever such reserved land, or any portion thereof, is not required, optioned, or condemned by the appropriate public agency within 90 days from the date of recording the subdivision, the subdivider may claim the original reservation, or portion thereof, and cause it to be subdivided in a manner suitable to the subdivider, subject to the provisions of these regulations. 
                  (6.3.4) The planning commission shall waive the reservation requirements of subsection (6.3.3) whenever the public body responsible for land acquisition executes written release stating that such planned feature is not to be acquired. 
                  (6.3.5) The planning commission shall disapprove any plat when such planned features, as specified by the master plan, are not incorporated in the plat. 
                  (6.3.6) Whenever a plat proposes the dedication of land to public use and the planning commission finds that such land is not required or suitable for public use, the planning commission may either refuse to approve said plat or it may require the rearrangement of lots to include such land. 
                  Sec. 6.4. - Zoning and other regulations. 
                  Whenever there is a discrepancy between the minimum standards or dimensions noted in these regulations and those contained in the zoning ordinance or other city regulations, the most restrictive shall apply. 
                  Sec. 6.5. - Street and subdivision names. 
                  The planning commission may refuse to accept street names and subdivision names. Streets that are obviously in alignment with existing streets shall be given the name of the existing street. Names of new streets shall not duplicate or closely approximate those of existing streets. 
                  Sec. 6.6. - Nonsubdivision developments. 
                  The standards and requirements of these regulations may be modified in the case of a plan for a development which is not to be subdivided into customary lots, blocks, and streets, when in the judgment of the planning commission, said plan will provide adequate open spaces and improvements for the circulation, recreation, light, air and service needs of the tract when fully developed and populated, and which also provides such covenants or other means as will assure conformity to and achievement of the plan. Plans for such developments shall be submitted to and approved by the planning commission whether or not a plat is to be recorded and no building permits shall be issued until such approval has been given. Failure of the planning commission to act on such a plan within 40 days shall be deemed approval, and thereafter a certificate of approval shall be issued to the developer at his request. However, if the planning commission determines that additional time is required to study the plan, an extension of time shall be requested in writing and the developer may agree thereto. 
                  ARTICLE VII. - DESIGN STANDARDS 

                  Sec. 7.1. - Design.

                  (7.2.3) Minor streets shall be so laid out that their use by through traffic will be discouraged. 
                  (7.2.4) The planning commission may require the subdivider to provide a temporary vehicular turn-around within the right-of-way at the end of any dead-end street other than a cul-de-sac, when the commission finds this necessary for safe traffic circulation. 
                  (7.2.5) Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed major street, the planning commission may require marginal access streets, double frontage lots with screen planting contained in a nonaccess reservation along the rear property lines, deep lots with rear service drives, or such other treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential properties and to afford separation of through and local traffic. 
                  (7.2.6) Where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad right-of-way, or expressway right-of-way, the planning commission may require a street approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening land. Such distances shall also be determined with due regard for the requirements of approach grades and future grade separations.

                  (1)  All concrete shall have a minimum 28-day compressive strength of 4,000 per square inch (psi). Concrete shall be manufactured and delivered in accordance with the latest revised Standard Specification for Ready Mixed Concrete, ASTM C94. 
                  (2)  Concrete shall be produced with a minimum cement content of 520 pounds per cubic yard, and a minimum water/cement ratio of 0.53. 
                  (3)  Maximum allowable concrete slump shall be four inches. 
                  (4)  Where it can be shown that adequate strength surface finish, and durability can be obtained on a consistent basis with mix designs other than those specified above, such designs may be used upon written approval. When compressive strength alone is specified, the proportions of cement, fine aggregates, coarse aggregates, water and admixture to be used in the mix shall be determined by an approved testing laboratory or a registered professional engineer, in accordance with the American Concrete Institute (ACI) Standard 318-77, sections 4.2 through 4.8 (excluding section 4.6). 
                  (b)  Concrete placement. Ready-mixed concrete hauled in truck mixers or truck agitators shall be deposited in place within 90 minutes from the time water is added to the mix. 
                  Before placing concrete, freestanding water, snow, ice or other foreign materials shall be removed from subgrade. All forms shall be thoroughly cleaned, secured in position, and coated with a form-release agent. 
                  Concrete shall be placed, struck off, consolidated, and finished to plan grade with a mechanical finishing machine, vibrating screed, or by hand-finishing methods when approved. In lieu of fixed forms, the contractor may place concrete with a slipform paver designed to spread, consolidated, screed, and float finish the freshly placed concrete in one complete pass of the machine. 
                  Concrete thickness shall be minimum of five inches without reinforcement for residential and collector streets. Major thoroughfares and streets serving industrial areas shall be a minimum of seven inches in thickness with properly designed reinforcement. 
                  After placement of the concrete, the pavement thickness should be determined by measurement of cores drilled from the pavement. Cores should be taken at intervals of one per 1,000 square yards of paving as required by the engineer. The cores should have a meter of at least four inches. Measurements of individual cores should be performed in accordance with ASTM C174. 
                  (c)  Finishing. After concrete has been struck off and consolidated, a bullfloat may be used to remove any high or low spots. Bullfloat use shall be confined to a minimum. A final skid-resistant finish shall be made with a burlap drag or broom. 
                  (d)  Curing and protecting concrete. Concrete shall be cured by protecting it from loss of moisture, rapid temperature change, and mechanical injury for at least three days after placement. After all free water has disappeared from the surface, concrete shall be covered and cured. A liquid membrane-forming compound shall be uniformly sprayed on all exposed surfaces. Rate of application shall be in accordance with manufacturer's recommendations. Other approved curing materials such as burlap or polyethylene sheeting may be used. 
                  When concrete is being placed in cold weather and the temperature may drop below 35 degrees Fahrenheit, straw, hay, insulated curing blankets, or other suitable material shall be provided along the line of work to prevent freezing of concrete. Concrete injured by frost action shall be removed and replaced at the contractors expense. 
                  In order that the concrete may be protected against the effects of rain before the concrete is sufficiently hardened, the contractor should be required to have available, at all times, materials for the protection of the surface. Such protective materials should consist of burlap or cotton mats, curing paper or plastic sheeting material. When rain appears imminent, all paving operations should stop and all personnel should take the necessary steps for complete protection of the unhardened concrete. No retopping of damaged concrete will be allowed. 
                  (e)  Joints. Unless shown on the project drawings, a jointing location plan shall be prepared by the contractor and approved before paving begins. 
                  Control joints or contracting joints shall be formed by one of the following methods: sawing, forming by hand, forming by premolded filler, or using full-depth construction joints. Joint depth shall be a minimum of one-fourth the slab thickness. Hand-formed joints shall have a maximum edge radius of one-fourth inch. Sawing of joints shall begin as soon as the concrete has hardened sufficiently to permit sawing without excessive raveling. All joints shall be completed before uncontrolled shrinkage/ cracking occurs. Joints shall be continuous across the slab, unless interrupted by full-depth premolded joint filler. Joints shall extend completely through the curb. Joint openings wider than one-fourth inch shall be cleaned and sealed before opening to traffic. 
                  Isolation joints (expansion joints) shall be used to isolate fixed objects abutting or within the paved area. They shall contain premolded joint filler for the full-depth of the slab. 
                  Dowels shall be used at transverse and longitudinal construction joints. The dowels should be plain round bars conforming to ASTM A615, or CSA G30.12. Before delivery to the jobsite at least one-half of each bar should be covered with one coat of lead or tar paint. Dowels should be placed at mid-depth in the slab and should be able to move longitudinally in their slot. Recommended dowel dimensions and spacings are given in the following table: 

                   
                  1 All dowels spaced at 12-inch centers. 
                  2 On each side of joint. 
                  3 Allowance made for joint openings and for minor error in positioning dowels. 
                  Joint spacing shall be as follows: Longitudinal joint spacing shall not exceed 12.5 feet. Transverse joint spacing should be at regular intervals of 15 feet or less. Longitudinal construction joints should be either keyed (tongue-and-groove) or butt-type with tiebars to hold adjacent slabs in vertical alignment. See Diagram No. 3A for typical joint details. [3] 
                  When approved, the contractor shall be permitted to make minor adjustments in joint location to make them coincide with drainage or other structures. 
                  (f)  Opening to traffic. The pavement shall be closed to passenger-car traffic for at least three full days or until such time that the minimum compressive strength of the concrete is at least 75 degrees of its design strength. Traffic shall be restricted to passenger cars and light trucks for at least seven days after concrete is placed. In all cases approval shall be obtained prior to opening of the pavement to traffic. No traffic should be permitted on the pavement until the joints have been sealed. 
                  The contractor should protect the pavement and its appurtenances against both public traffic and traffic caused by his own employees and agents. Any damage to the pavement, occurring prior to opening to the public, shall be repaired or the pavement replaced, by procedures and methods as approved. 
                  (g)  Inspection and approvals. For each day's placement of concrete at least one set of three cylinders shall be made by the contractor or a testing laboratory. Not less than one set of specimens shall be made for every 500 feet of paving. One of the cylinders shall be tested at the age of seven days, one at the age of 28 days, and one at the discretion of the engineer, to determine the quality of concrete obtained. The costs for performing such tests shall be borne by the contractor. 
                  B.  The pavement of medium-duty streets shall consist of an asphaltic limestone wearing course, black asphalt base and aggregate subbase, as specified herein.

It shall be applied and compacted by asphalt spreader equipment. After compaction, the black base shall be smooth and true to established profiles and sections, and a minimum of three inches thick. 
                  (3)  Surface course. The surface course for all pavement, including prime or tack coat, shall conform to the Asphaltic Concrete, Type "E" (modified top). The surface course shall be applied and compacted by asphalt spreader equipment, and after compaction, of minimum thickness of one inch, but in no event less than 100 pounds per square yard. Any high, low or defective areas shall be immediately remedied by cutting out the course at the area and replacing with fresh, hot mix, to be immediately compacted to conform to the surrounding area and thoroughly bonded thereto. 
                  (4)  Wet areas. When a wet or unsuitable area is encountered or anticipated during construction an additional six inches of crusher run stone subbase shall be required. A total of 12 inches of crusher run stone subbase, as specified above, shall be provided in areas with wet or unsuitable soil. 
                  C.  Core samples will be taken of all bases and paving before acceptance by the City of Riverdale. If any one core is one-fourth inch less than the required specification, it will not be accepted by the City of Riverdale. 
                  D.  All paving done within the limits of the street right-of-way in the City of Riverdale shall be governed by these same specifications. 
                  E.  All paving shall be approved by the city engineer.
