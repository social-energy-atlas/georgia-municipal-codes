PREFACE 
</p>
        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Waycross, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1977 Code, as supplemented through February 5, 2013, and ordinances adopted by the City Commission on or before November 3, 2015. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1977 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Julie Lovelace, Code Attorney, and Beth Tattershall, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Julie Dinkins, City Clerk, and Rick Currie, City Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

The clerk shall at once upon the expiration of said five days cause three printed or typewritten copies of such petition, without the signatures, to be made, and to each of them shall attach a printed or typewritten copy of such defensive statement, if one be furnished him in the time provided. He shall cause the copies of such petition to be placed on file in his office, and provide facilities for signing same by voters who may desire to sign. The city clerk shall then immediately cause notice to be published in the newspaper in said city in which the legal advertisements of the city are placed of the placing of such copies of such petition in his office. Such copies of such petition shall remain on file in the office of the city clerk for a period of 30 days, during which time any of them may be signed by a qualified voter. Each signer of such petition shall sign his name thereto in ink or indelible pencil, and shall sign his name in person, and not by agent or attorney, and in the presence of the city clerk, and shall place thereafter his residence by street and number. 
                  (b)  At the expiration of said period of 30 days, the city clerk shall assemble the three copies in his office as one instrument, and shall certify thereon that the signatures appearing on said petitions were signed in person by the voters whose names appear thereon at his office and in his presence. He shall examine the same and ascertain and certify whether the signatures thereon amount to at least 25 percent of the registered voters as shown by the official registration list for the general election last held. If such signatures amount to such percent he shall at once serve notice of the fact upon the commissioner or commissioners designated in the petition and also deliver to the commission a copy of the original petition with his certificate as to the percentage of qualified voters who signed same, and a certificate as to the date of his last mentioned notice to the commissioner or commissioners designated in the petition. 
                  (c)  If the commissioner or commissioners designated in said petition or any of them, file with the city clerk within five days after the last mentioned notice from the city clerk, a written resignation from office, the clerk shall at once notify the commission of that fact, and such resignation shall be irrevocable. In the absence of any such resignation, the commission shall forthwith order and fix a day for holding a recall election for the removal of those not resigning.

The pages of a supplement shall be so numbered that they will fit properly into the Code and will, where necessary, replace pages which have become obsolete or partially obsolete, and the new pages shall be so prepared that, when they have been inserted, the Code will be current through the date of the adoption of the latest ordinance included in the supplement.

For example, the codifier may: 
                  (1)  Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions; 
                  (2)  Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles; 
                  (3)  Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the Code and, where necessary to accommodate new material, change existing section or other subdivision numbers; 
                  (4)  Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case may be, or to "sections _____ to _____" (inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code); and 
                  (5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meaning of ordinance sections inserted into the Code; but, in no case, shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code.

                  (Code 1977, § 11½-2; Ord. No. 05-11, §§ 1, 2, 5-3-2005) 
                  Sec. 2-116. - Declaration of policy. 
                  (a)  The proper government and administration of the city requires that: 
                  (1)  Its officials, employees, appointees, and volunteers conducting official city business including those appointed by city commissioner such as commission and authority members: 
                  a.  Serve others and not themselves; 
                  b.  Be independent, impartial and responsible; 
                  c.  Use resources with efficiency and economy; 
                  d.  Treat all people fairly; 
                  e.  Use the power of their position for the well-being of their constituents; and 
                  f.  Create an environment of honesty, openness and integrity; 
                  (2)  Governmental policies and decisions are made in the proper channels of the government structure; 
                  (3)  Public office and employment not be used for undue personal gain; and 
                  (4)  The citizens of the city have confidence in the integrity of their government. 
                  (b)  Because the attainment of one or more of these ends is impaired whenever there exists in fact, or appears to exist, a conflict between the private interests and public responsibilities of city officials and employees, the public interest mandates that the city protect against such conflicts of interest by establishing appropriate ethical standards with respect to the conduct of its officials and employees in situations in which a conflict may exist or appear to exist. 
                  (c)  Yet it is also essential to the efficient operation of the city that those persons best qualified be encouraged to serve in positions of public trust. Accordingly, the standards set forth in this article must be understood and interpreted in a way that will not unreasonably frustrate or impede the desire to seek public office by those best qualified to serve. To that end, officials and employees should not, except as otherwise provided by law, be denied the opportunity available to all citizens to acquire and maintain private, economic and other interests except when a conflict would necessarily result. 
                  (d)  The policy and purpose of this article, therefore, is to clarify those standards of ethical conduct that shall be applicable to the officials and employees of the city in the discharge of their public duties and to foster the development and maintenance of a tradition of responsible and effective public service. 
                  (Code 1977, § 11½-1; Ord. No. 05-11, §§ 1, 2, 5-3-2005) 
                  Sec. 2-117. - Impartiality. 
                  No official or employee shall by his conduct give reasonable basis for the impression that any person improperly can influence such official or employee or unduly enjoy such official's or employee's favor in the performance of official acts or actions, or that such official or employee is affected unduly by kinship, rank, position or association with any person. 
                  (Code 1977, § 11½-5; Ord. No. 05-11, §§ 1, 2, 5-3-2005) 
                  Sec. 2-118. - Conflict of interest. 
                  No elected official, appointed officer, or employee of the city or any agency or political entity to which this Code applies shall knowingly engage in any business or transaction or have a financial or other personal interest, direct or indirect, which is incompatible with the proper discharge of official duties or which would tend to impair the independent judgment or action in the performance of official duties. 
                  (Code 1977, § 11½-7; Ord. No. 05-11, §§ 1, 2, 5-3-2005) 
                  Sec. 2-119. - Abstention. 
                  An official or employee who has an interest that he has reason to believe may be affected by his official acts or actions or by the official acts or actions of the city shall disclose that interest. Such official or employee shall abstain from participating in any such discussion, voting or otherwise participating in any official acts or actions affected by such interest. That interest shall be disclosed by such official or employee prior to there being taken any official act or actions. 
                  (Code 1977, § 11½-13; Ord. No. 05-11, §§ 1, 2, 5-3-2005) 
                  Sec. 2-120. - Gifts and favors. 
                  (a)  No official or employee shall accept any gift, loan, reward, favor or services that may reasonably tend to improperly influence him in the discharge of their official duties. This limitation is not intended to prohibit the acceptance of articles of negligible value, which are distributed generally, nor to prohibit officials or employees from accepting loans from regular lending institutions. It is particularly important that employees and officials guard against relationships, which might be construed as, or give the appearance of favoritism, coercion, unfair advantage or collusion (O.C.G.A. § 16-10-2). 
                  (b)  Nothing in this article shall prohibit any official or employee from accepting a gift on behalf of the city, provided that the person accepting the gift shall promptly report the receipt of such gift to the city commissioner, which shall have the gift added to the inventory of the property of the city. 
                  (c)  The provisions of this article shall not apply to campaign contributions made to an official in compliance with the Georgia Campaign and Financial Disclosure Act (O.C.G.A. § 21-5-30 et seq.).

                  Sec. 2-121. - Coercion. 
                  No official or employee shall use his position in any way to coerce, or give the appearance of coercing, another person to provide any financial benefit or other reward to him or persons within his immediate family, or those with whom the commissioner has business or financial ties. 
                  (Code 1977, § 11½-8; Ord. No. 05-11, §§ 1, 2, 5-3-2005) 
                  Sec. 2-122. - Confidential information. 
                  No official or employee shall disclose or otherwise use confidential information acquired by virtue of his position with the city for his or another's personal gain. 
                  (Code 1977, § 11½-9; Ord. No. 05-11, §§ 1, 2, 5-3-2005) 
                  Sec. 2-123. - Representation. 
                  Except in the regular discharge of official duties, no official or employee shall appear on behalf of any person, other than himself and his immediate family, before any city agency or municipal court. Neither shall any official or employee receive compensation for any services rendered on behalf of any person in relation to any case, proceeding or application before a city agency with respect to which such official or employee was directly concerned; or in which he has personally participated during the period of his service or employment, or which was under his active consideration or with respect to which knowledge or information was made available to him during the period of service or employment. However, a member of the city commission may appear before city agencies on behalf of his constituents in the course of his duties as a representative of the electorate or in the performance of public or civic obligations.

                  Sec. 2-124. - Incompatible employment. 
                  No official or employee shall engage in or accept employment with or render services for any private business or professional activity when such is adverse to and incompatible with the proper discharge of his official duties or would tend to impair his independence of judgment or action in the performance of his official duties. 
                  (Code 1977, § 11½-11; Ord. No. 05-11, §§ 1, 2, 5-3-2005) 
                  Sec. 2-125. - Public contracts. 
                  (a)  The city shall not enter into a contract involving services or property with any official or employee or with a business in which the official or employee has an interest. This section shall not apply in the case of: 
                  (1)  The designation of a bank or trust company as a depository for city funds; 
                  (2)  The borrowing of funds from any bank or lending institution, which offers the lowest available rate of interest in the community for such loan; 
                  (3)  Contracts entered into in accordance with the O.C.G.A. § 16-10-6; 
                  (4)  Contracts entered into under circumstances that constitute an emergency provided that a written record explaining the emergency is inserted by the mayor into the city commissioner minutes as soon as is practicable but no later than 15 days after the contract is entered into. 
                  (5)  Contracts entered into with an official or employee, or with a business in which the official or employee has an interest, provided that such contract is: 
                  a.  Awarded through a process of public notice and competitive bid; 
                  b.  Disclosure of the nature of such member's interest is made prior to the time a bid is submitted; and 
                  c.  After this section is complied with, a waiver of the prohibition contemplated by this section is issued by the city manager. 
                  (b)  The city shall not enter into any contract with, or take any official act or action favorably affecting, any person, or business represented by such person when such person has been a member of the governing authority within the 12-month period preceding such action, except when the city had a contract with such person or business prior to the member leaving office or unless the business received the contract for having the lowest and best bid pursuant to the purchasing procedures established by the city and the member did not represent the business in its discussions with or submissions to the mayor and commission.

                  Sec. 2-126. - Zoning. 
                  (a)  All officials and employees are deemed subject to the provisions of chapter 67A of title 36 of the O.C.G.A. (O.C.G.A. § 36-67A-1 et seq.), and shall make the disclosures required in such chapter, and shall be subject to the penalties stated in said chapter. 
                  (b)  In addition, any official required to make the disclosures set forth in chapter 67A of title 36 of the O.C.G.A. (O.C.G.A. § 36-67A-1 et seq.) shall be prohibited from participating in the zoning matter in which such official or employee has a direct or indirect interest. A violation of the aforesaid provisions of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated shall also constitute a violation of this article.

                  No official or employee will acquire an interest in any contract, property or other transaction in order to take advantage of such interest where the official or employee, has reason to believe the city will act upon the contract, property or other transaction to the benefit of the official or employee.

                  Sec. 2-165. - Constituting the board; chairman. 
                  (a)  The board of ethics of the city is hereby created and authorized by the mayor and city commission. 
                  (b)  The board of ethics shall be composed of five residents of the city to be appointed as provided in this subsection and subsection (c) of this section. Each member of the board of ethics shall have been a resident of the city for at least one year immediately preceding the date of taking office and shall remain a resident of the city while serving as a member of the board of ethics. No person shall serve as a member of the board of ethics if the person has, or has had within the preceding one-year period, any interest in any contract, transaction, or official action of the city. 
                  (c)  The mayor and commissioners shall each designate two qualified citizens to provide a pool of 12 individuals who have consented to serve as a member of such board of ethics. These individuals must agree to undergo a criminal background check conducted by the police department prior to designation, and/or redesignation, the results of which will be forwarded to the mayor and commission. These individuals should be available to be called upon for a period of two years to serve in the event a board of ethics is appointed. Upon initial designation to the pool, each individual shall attend a training session on this article, conducted by the city. Annually thereafter during their term, each individual shall be required to attend a training class at city expense. The mayor and commissioner shall re-designate individuals to serve in the pool in January at the conclusion of each pool member's two-year term. Pool members can be reappointed and there shall be no term limits for the pool members since future members of commission may wish to appoint the same pool members. However, the term for individuals appointed by the mayor or a commissioner shall end after two years. The city clerk shall maintain a list of the 12 qualified individuals. If a member of the pool does not finish their term, the commissioner who designated the original member shall put forward a new designee to fill the remaining pool term. 
                  (d)  During the annual training session the pool shall select a chairman at the beginning of each calendar year from the 12 qualified members listed by the commission. The chairmanship shall remain in place for a one calendar year period. The chairman shall receive additional training regarding the procedures for conducting a hearing. If the chairman leaves before the end of their term, the candidate pool member shall be replaced as set out in subsection (c) of this section and the pool members shall select a new chairman to fill out the remaining term. 
                  (e)  A quorum of the member pool of the board of ethics shall be seven members. A quorum of the pool shall be required for annual training and the selection of a chairman. 
                  (Code 1977, § 11½-3(a); Ord. No. 05-11, §§ 1, 2, 5-3-2005) 
                  Sec. 2-166. - Duties of board. 
                  The constituted board of ethics shall have the following duties and powers: 
                  (1)  To administer this article; 
                  (2)  To receive, review, investigate, process, make determinations on, and hear complaints of violations of standards required by this article; 
                  (3)  To make such investigation and response to a complaint as it deems necessary to determine whether any person has violated any provisions of this article; 
                  (4)  To hold such hearings and make such inquiries as deemed necessary to investigate and rule upon complaints; 
                  (5)  Recommend any legislative or administrative action regarding the city's policies and practices which the board believes would or could enhance the ethical environment in which public servants work; 
                  (6)  To report its findings and actions to the city commission; 
                  (7)  All other duties and powers listed in section 2-167(f). 
                  (Code 1977, § 11½-3(b); Ord. No. 05-11, §§ 1, 2, 5-3-2005) 
                  Sec. 2-167. - Enforcement and administration. 
                  (a)  Selection time. The constituted board of ethics shall be selected within 15 days after receipt of a complaint. 
                  (b)  Complaints. 
                  (1)  All complaints of ethical violations must be filed with the city manager, in writing, no later than 90 days after the alleged act occurred unless the complainant, by exercising reasonable diligence, failed to discover the alleged ethical violation within such 90-day period. In such a case, the complainant must file a written complaint with the city manager not later than 90 days after the complainant discovered the alleged violation. In all such cases brought after 90 days from the date of the alleged ethical violation, the complainant bears the burden of convincing the board of the true date complainant learned of the alleged violation. 
                  (2)  In no event, shall an ethical charge be filed with the city manager more than two years from the date of the alleged ethical violation. 
                  (3)  Constituting a hearing board. All complaints against an official or city employee shall be filed in writing and submitted to the city manager. The city manager shall provide a copy of the complaint to the mayor and commission. 
                  a.  During a public meeting of the mayor and commission the city clerk shall place 11 names of the pool members in a receptacle. The chairman of the board shall be pre-selected by the pool at its annual meeting. The city clerk will then draw six names from the nine in the receptacle. The first four pool members selected, plus the chairman, shall constitute the board for consideration of the matter at hand. The last two names selected shall be alternates in the event that some of the chosen members cannot serve. 
                  b.  The city clerk shall notify the selected members of their appointment by telephone the following day and shall ask if there is any reason the member feels they cannot or should not (due to a conflict of interest) serve on the board concerning the particular complaint. 
                  c.  Pay and other staff support. 
                  1.  The members of the board of ethics shall serve without compensation. The governing authority of the city shall provide meeting space for the board of ethics. Subject to budgetary procedures and requirements of the city, the city shall provide the board of ethics with such supplies and equipment as may be reasonably necessary for it to perform its duties and responsibilities. 
                  2.  The city attorney is designated to be the legal advisor of the board, except that the city attorney is not authorized to represent the board in any legal action if doing so would create a conflict, which would prevent the city attorney from also representing the mayor, the city manager, or the governing body. 
                  3.  The city clerk shall serve as the recording secretary to the board and shall provide such administrative services to the board as may be necessary. 
                  (4)  The complainant may withdraw the complaint at any time in writing. 
                  (c)  Dismissal of frivolous complaints. Within 30 days of board selection the board may perform one or more of the following: 
                  (1)  Upon receipt of a complaint in proper form, review the complaint to determine whether the complaint is unjustified, frivolous, patently unfounded or fails to state facts sufficient to invoke disciplinary jurisdiction. The board of ethics shall be empowered to collect evidence and information concerning any complaint and to add the findings and results of its investigation to the file containing such complaint; 
                  (2)  Upon completion of its review and/or investigation of a complaint, the board at a public meeting may dismiss those complaints which are unjustified, frivolous, patently unfounded or which fail to state facts sufficient to invoke disciplinary jurisdiction. Provided, however, that a rejection of such complaint by the board of ethics shall not deprive the complaining party of any action he might otherwise have at law or in equity against the respondent government servant. A rejection shall prevent refiling of a complaint regarding the same subject and alleged perpetrator for the same offense within six months of the original complaint filing; 
                  (3)  Admonish, formally reprimand, publicly censure, any complaining party that files an unjustified, frivolous, patently unfounded or factually insufficient complaint; and 
                  (4)  Forward an order to the mayor and commission as set out in subsection (f)(22) of this section; or 
                  (5)  Hold a public hearing within 60 days after the selection of the board. 
                  (d)  Parties rights. At any hearing held by the board of ethics, the official, employee, or respondent who is the subject of inquiry shall have the right to written notice of the allegations at least ten business days before a hearing, to be represented by counsel, to hear and examine the evidence and witnesses and to present evidence and witnesses in opposition or in extenuation according to the procedures contained in subsection (f) of this section. 
                  (e)  Advisory opinions. When any official, employee, or person appointed by commissioner has a doubt regarding the applicability of any provision of this article to a particular situation, or regarding the definition of its terms, he may apply in writing or verbally during a public meeting to the city attorney for an advisory opinion. The advisory opinion shall be written unless it is given verbally during a public meeting, and may be provided directly to the requestor of such opinion. Nothing in this article shall be construed to prohibit a request for an informal opinion by any public servant from the city attorney regarding a potential conflict of interest. Neither a request for an informal opinion, nor the making of a statement concerning a potential conflict of interest made by a member of the governing body in the course of abstaining from voting shall create a presumption or inference that a public servant actually has a personal interest in the matter about which the opinion was requested. 
                  (f)  Hearing procedures. 
                  (1)  At the hearing the conduct of the parties shall be dignified both on and off the record. Misconduct before the board may be grounds for summary exclusion from the hearing. The hearing is intended to receive evidence either to refute or to substantiate specific charges. It shall not be a forum for discussion of extraneous or irrelevant matters having no bearing on the charges, and the alleged misconduct of others who may have escaped discipline in the past shall serve as no defense. All parties at action and witnesses shall be given ample time and opportunity to develop points, subject to the discretion of the board. It should be recognized that the board will be composed of private citizens. Accordingly, the board may not follow established legal procedures as might be expected in a court of law. However, in taking testimony and in considering the evidence, the board shall follow accepted legal procedure insofar as is practicable but shall not be bound by the technical rules of evidence observed in courts of law. The board may listen to hearsay testimony and assign such weight as may be warranted and may accept depositions and affidavits, if such testimony is material and relevant to the issues. The board may decline to listen to numerous character witnesses or numbers of witnesses testifying to identical facts. 
                  (2)  The chairman of the board of ethics shall conduct the hearing. 
                  (3)  The hearing shall be recorded and the city clerk shall prepare a written summary of the hearing. The complainant and/or respondent may provide a court reporter at their expense for a verbatim transcript of the hearing, if so desired. The city clerk, or their designee shall take minutes of the hearing, specifically including the name of the board members who make any motions, the board members who second any such motions, and the names of the individuals on the board and how each voted. This written report shall be presented to the city commission at the conclusion of the board's proceedings. 
                  (4)  A quorum of the board shall be required to conduct the hearing. A quorum shall be defined as five members. If a member is unable to attend the hearing, the mayor shall designate one of the alternates to replace the member. The ethics board may, before the hearing and upon ten days notice to all parties, approve regulations governing conduct of ethics board hearings so long as such regulations do not conflict with this article. 
                  (5)  The person who filed the complaint ("complainant") shall present his case to the board first. 
                  (6)  All documentary evidence which is anticipated to be submitted to the board at the hearing by either the respondent or the complainant, and the names, with telephone numbers, of all individuals expected to present testimony to the board on behalf of either the respondent or complainant, must be given to the city clerk at least ten days in advance of the hearing. This requirement shall not apply to evidence used solely for purposes of cross examination or rebuttal. The failure of a party to adhere to this rule shall preclude such party from tendering such evidence or individual's testimony at the hearing through any form. The respondent, complainant, and the public shall be entitled to see all such lists that are placed on file with the city clerk. 
                  (7)  The board may compel the production of any document in the possession of the city and subject to Open Records Act and the testimony of any city employee except where the employee is the respondent. All evidence shall be presented to all parties pursuant to subsection (f)(6) of this section. Where the board compels any such document or testimony after a hearing has commenced a continuation shall be provided so that subsection (f)(6) of this section can be complied with. 
                  (8)  Neither party shall have the right to require depositions of any individual, including the opposite party. The respondent and complainant shall have the right to obtain affidavits that may be submitted to the board for consideration provided that such affidavits were filed with the city clerk no less than 48 hours prior to the hearing, and that the name of the affiant is provided to the city clerk. Both the respondent, complainant, and the public shall be entitled to see all such affidavits, which are placed on file with the city clerk. 
                  (9)  The complainant's evidence must prove that respondent is guilty of the offense charged by the evidentiary standard commonly referred to as "preponderance of the evidence." 
                  (10)  Each witness presented by the complainant, and including the complainant, shall be subject to cross examination by the individual accused of the ethical violation ("respondent") or such person's representative. 
                  (11)  At the conclusion of the complainant's case, the respondent shall be entitled to move for dismissal based on insufficient evidence on the part of complainant's case. If respondent makes such a motion and the board, by majority vote, agrees to dismiss the complaint, the hearing shall be terminated at this point. If either the respondent fails to make such a motion, or, if the board decides by majority vote to overrule respondent's motion, the hearing shall continue. The board may also direct a decision in favor of the respondent upon the board's own initiative. 
                  (12)  Respondent shall then be entitled to present his evidence to the board. 
                  (13)  Respondent is not required to testify. The absence of respondent's testimony shall not be viewed by the board as an admission of any sort. 
                  (14)  If respondent testifies, then respondent shall be subject to cross examination by complainant. All other witnesses who testify in the respondent's case shall be subject to cross examination by complainant. 
                  (15)  All persons who testify before the board, shall be placed under oath, by either the chairman or a person designated by the chairman. The oath shall read substantially as follows: 
                  "Do you solemnly swear or affirm that the testimony that you are about to give in this matter (name matter) shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth so help you God?" 
                  (16)  At the conclusion of respondent's case, the complainant may offer rebuttal evidence only to those items presented in respondent's case. At the conclusion of complainant's rebuttal, respondent shall be entitled to offer rebuttal evidence only to those matters presented in complainant's rebuttal case. 
                  (17)  During the course of testimony and at the conclusion of all the testimony and closure of all of the evidence, the board members may ask questions of any of the individuals who testified before the board. 
                  (18)  At the conclusion of all questions by parties and board members, the chairman shall end the hearing and permit the board to deliberate in public. If the board decides by majority vote that additional evidence is needed to make a decision, the board shall have the authority to conduct its own investigation or to require either the complainant or respondent to submit additional evidence at a continuation of the hearing which must be held no later than 45 days after the date of the initial hearing. The board has no authority to continue the hearing past this 45-day deadline. 
                  (19)  Following the conclusion of any additional evidence received at the continued hearing, the board shall continue to deliberate. When deliberations are concluded, the chairman shall call for a vote. The board may vote immediately after deliberations are concluded or they may continue the meeting for up to two weeks when a public vote must be taken. The board's first vote must be whether the respondent violated the ethics code as charged by the complainant. If, by majority vote, the board rules that the respondent did not violate the ethics code as charged by the complainant, then the matter is concluded. If the board, by majority vote, concludes that the respondent did violate the ethics code as charged by the complainant, then the board must make a second decision by majority vote. The second decision involves the form of penalty. The board shall have six options of penalty which include: 
                  a.  No admonishment and no further action; 
                  b.  A public reprimand and admonishment not to violate the ethics code in the future; 
                  c.  Formal reprimand; 
                  d.  Public censure; 
                  e.  Recommendation for termination, resignation or recall; and 
                  f.  Recommendation of prosecution in city court. 
                  (20)  The complainant may withdraw his complaint at any time without the approval of the board. 
                  (21)  If any question concerning the hearing procedures, which is not otherwise addressed in this article, the city attorney, or in his absence, the appointed legal advisor to the board shall resolve the procedural question. Such resolution shall be placed in writing by the city attorney or other legal advisor and given to both parties. Such resolution shall also be presented to the board for final approval and recommendation to amend this article by adding such procedure. 
                  (22)  An order will be generated by the board and submitted to the mayor and commissioner for inclusion in the minutes within five days of the completed hearing. 
                  (g)  Appeals. 
                  (1)  Any final decision by the board of ethics shall be reviewable by the city commission in a public meeting set for such purpose. The request for appeal shall be filed within ten days after the issuance of a final decision by the board of ethics with the city manager. The commission will be notified of the appeal at its next regular work session and shall set a date for a hearing to be held within 45 days of the work session at which the appeal date is set. The city manager shall cause notice of the hearing to be delivered by certified mail, return receipt requested or by such other means to ensure notice to the appellant (i.e., personal service), not less than ten days prior to the date set for the hearing. At the hearing on the appeal, the appellant shall be permitted to argue his case before the mayor and commission, but shall not be permitted to present any further evidence, either documentary or testimony. The commission shall render its opinion by a public vote at the conclusion of the proceedings to: 
                  a.  Affirm the decision of the board of ethics; 
                  b.  Reverse the decision of the board of ethics and enter a decision of a less severe nature; or 
                  c.  Remand the case to the board of ethics for further consideration. 
                  (2)  Any final decision by the city commission shall be reviewable by the superior court of the county. The review by the superior court shall be limited to an inquiry of whether there was any evidence before the board of ethics and city commission which supported the decision of the commission. This appeal shall be filed within ten days after the final decision of the commission. Provided, however, no action of the city commission or board of ethics refusing or failing to take action pursuant to this code of ethics shall be reviewable by the superior court.

                  (c)  At the time quarantine is ordered by the animal control officer, the animal or custodian shall sign a home quarantine agreement or submit the animal to a licensed animal shelter for the ten-day period and pay any fees required.

Therefore, as stated by the general assembly of the state, the owner of a dangerous dog or vicious dog shall be solely liable for any injury to or death caused by such dog. Under no circumstances shall the city or any employee or official of the county which enforces or fails to enforce the provisions of said law or this chapter shall be held liable for any damages to any person who suffers an injury inflicted by a dog that has been identified as being a dangerous dog or vicious dog or by a dog that has been reported to the proper authority as being a dangerous dog or vicious dog or by a dog that the city has failed to identify as a dangerous or vicious dog or by a dog which has been identified as being a dangerous dog or vicious dog, but has not been kept or restrained in the manner prescribed by law, or by a dangerous dog or vicious dog whose owner has not maintained insurance coverage or a surety bond as required by law.

At least ten days prior to the hearing, the animal control board shall mail to the dog owner written notice of the date, time, and place of the hearing. At the hearing, the dog owner shall be given the opportunity to testify and present evidence and the animal control board shall receive other evidence and testimony as may be reasonably necessary to sustain, modify, or overrule the dog control officer's determination. 
                  (d)  Within ten days after the hearing, the animal control board shall mail written notice to the dog owner of its determination on the matter.

                  ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

                  Sec. 18-1. - Open burning and outdoor fires. 
                  (a)  Prohibition; exceptions. It is unlawful for any person in any area of the city to cause, suffer, allow or permit open burning of any vegetative matter such as leaves, grasses, pine straw, pine cones, tree limbs or stumps, including the "slash burning" of forest residue for land-clearing purposes; of refuse, trash, or rubbish of any kind; of any materials which include soils or are in contact with soils during burning; of any other open-burning material; or to use for open burning any noncontainment devices such as air-curtain destructors, common backyard fireplaces or fire pits dug into the ground; or to suffer, allow or permit open burning that will be offensive or objectionable because of smoke or odor emissions when atmospheric conditions or local circumstances make such fires hazardous, except as follows: 
                  (1)  Any grill, barbeque or other metal framework using charcoal, wood, propane or natural gas for cooking food for immediate human consumption, provided no nuisance is created. 
                  (2)  Operation of devices using open flames such as kettles, blow torches, welding torches, portable heaters, and other flame-making equipment, provided that the use of such equipment does not violate other local or state law. 
                  (3)  Training fire department personnel under the supervision of the fire chief or his designee. 
                  (4)  Silviculture practices specifically related to "prescribed burning" under authority of the state forestry commission, as exempted from local ordinance, resolution, and regulation by the Official Code of Georgia Annotated. For purposes of this subsection, the term "prescribed burning" of any forest land means a "permitted" fire set by the owner or owner's designated agent under controlled conditions to burn forest understory and used as a forest management practice to establish favorable seedbeds, remove competing underbrush, accelerate nutrient recycling, control insect pests, enhance wildlife habitat, and otherwise contribute ecological benefits. Not exempted is the burning of leaf or brush piles not necessary to accomplish the purposes of prescribed burning. 
                  (5)  Chimeneas or any other similar commercially produced freestanding vessels made of metal in which a contained outdoor fire is made; or fire pits made from stones, masonry or similar material for keeping a contained outdoor fire and used for cooking or warmth, provided no nuisance is created. 
                  (6)  Burn barrels, as long as the burn barrels are at least 25 feet away from any building or structure and on private property. Any burn barrel shall have vent holes above the ash line for combustion air and shall be covered with a heavy mesh wire screen. Untreated wood or lumber shall be the only material or substance allowed in burn barrels and must not produce dense smoke or create any nuisance. Burn barrels shall be constantly attended and supervised by a competent person of at least 18 years of age until the fire is extinguished and cold. 
                  (7)  Bonfires, being a large open air fire used as part of a celebration, provided that a bonfire shall not be conducted within 150 feet of a structure or any combustible material or growth. Conditions which would cause a fire to spread within 150 feet of a structure shall be eliminated prior to ignition of the bonfire. Except as otherwise provided by law, a permit must be obtained from the city fire department prior to kindling a fire for a bonfire. Application for such permit shall only be made by the owner of the land upon which the fire is to be kindled or the duly authorized representative of such owner. Any permit issued under this section is good only for the day issued. 
                  (8)  Open burning of vegetative material for the purpose of land clearing using an air curtain destructor, provided the following conditions are met: 
                  a.  The location of the air curtain destructor is at least 300 feet from any occupied structure or public road or private road. An air curtain destructor used solely for utility line clearing or road clearing may be located at a lesser distance upon approval of the department of natural resources, or environmental protection division; 
                  b.  No more than one air curtain destructor is operated within a ten-acre area at one time or there must be at least 1,000 feet between any two air curtain destructors; 
                  c.  Only wood waste consisting of tress, logs, large brush and stumps which are relatively free of soil are burned in the air curtain destructor; 
                  d.  Tires or other rubber products, plastics, heavy oils or asphaltic based or impregnated materials are not used to start or maintain the operation of the air curtain destructor; 
                  e.  The air curtain destructor is constructed, installed and operated in a manner consistent with good air pollution control practice for minimizing emissions of fly ash and smoke; 
                  f.  The cleaning out of the air curtain destructor pit is performed in a manner to prevent fugitive dust; and 
                  g.  The air curtain destructor cannot be fired before 10:00 a.m. and the fire must be completely extinguished, using water or by covering with dirt, at least one hour before sunset. 
                  (9)  The fire department shall investigate any complaint about fire or smoke. Any fire started or maintained in violation of this section is a nuisance prohibited by section 26-19 and shall be promptly extinguished by the person or persons responsible for same upon notice by the fire chief or his designee. 
                  (b)  Permit required. Except as otherwise provided by law, a permit must be obtained from the city fire department prior to kindling a fire for recognized silvicultural or range or wildlife management practices, or prevention or control of disease or pests or bonfires. Application for such permit shall only be made by the owner of the land upon which the fire is to be kindled or the duly authorized representative of such owner. 
                  (c)  Revocation of permit. The city fire chief or his designee may revoke a permit issued pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, when the fire chief or his designee finds by inspection or otherwise that: 
                  (1)  The permit is used for a location or establishment other than that for which the permit was issued; 
                  (2)  The permit is used for a condition or activity other than that authorized in the permit; 
                  (3)  The conditions and limitations set forth in the permit have been violated; 
                  (4)  There have been any false statements or misrepresentations as to a material fact in the application or permit or plans submitted therewith or a condition of the permit; 
                  (5)  If neighbors complain about the smoke. 
                  (d)  Attendance. Open burning, bonfires or recreational fires shall be constantly attended by the permittee or other person designated in the permit until the fire is completely extinguished. A minimum of one portable fire extinguisher with a minimum 4-A rating or other approved on-site fire extinguishing equipment, such as dirt, sand, water barrel, garden hose or water truck, shall be kept at the fire location and available for immediate utilization to extinguish the fire.

                  ARTICLE II. - SMOKING PROHIBITED IN CERTAIN AREAS WITHIN BUILDINGS AND INDOOR FACILITIES OF THE CITY 

                  Sec. 20-20. - Legislative intent. 
                  The city commission finds that the effects of secondary, tertiary and side-stream smoke generated by the smoking of cigars, cigarettes, pipes and similar articles poses a threat to the health, safety and well-being of the citizens of the city who do not smoke. The city commission further finds that the Surgeon General's reports on smoking hazards, linking high levels of involuntary smoke exposure buttresses the need to provide more protection to non-smokers in public settings. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to place reasonable limitations on smoking within buildings and indoor facilities and city owned or leased vehicles of the city, while striking a balance between the health needs of all non-smoking individuals and the rights of smokers. The city commission further finds that it is in the interest of public health, safety, and general welfare of the employees, residents and visitors of the city to protect them from the impacts of breathing secondary, tertiary or side-stream smoke in buildings and indoor facilities and vehicles owned, leased, managed and operated by the city.

The execution shall be a lien on the property, and when recorded in the general execution docket of the county in which the property is located, shall be a lien on all property of the defendant in execution from the date of the recording. 
                  If the municipal court authorizes the sale of the seized inoperable or junked vehicle, the advertisement shall be published one a week for three consecutive weeks in the newspaper in which official city notices are published and shall describe and identify the vehicle to be sold, the fact that it was impounded by the city as an inoperable or junked motor vehicle and will be sold at the place where stored to the highest bidder for cash on a date certain more than ten days after the publication of the last notice unless the vehicle shall have been claimed by the owner and all costs incurred in connection with the removal, storage and advertisement thereof are paid prior thereto. Should the sale for any reason be declared invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the city's liability shall be limited to the return of the purchase price. 
                  (f)  Garden flowers and vegetables, cultivated agricultural crops, ornamental shrubbery and trees shall not be considered to be a violation of this section. 
                  (g)  Any party in possession of property and/or party in interest may appeal the notice of abatement within 15 days of receipt of notice or posting, whichever is applicable, by filing written notice of appeal to the city clerk within 15 days of the receipt of the notice or the posting of notice, whichever applies, and shall state the grounds for such appeal. At such hearing, the city clerk shall give the building and code manager and the party in possession or party in interest the opportunity to present evidence and argument concerning the appeal.

Such cost shall be billed to the owner of said property and upon the owner's nonpayment of such costs for a period of 30 days after the billing thereof, it shall be the duty of the city clerk to issue an execution for such costs of the abatement in the form authorized by law, against said owner, which execution shall be delivered over to the city manager or his designee to be executed by such legal officer for the purpose of satisfying the amount of the same and such additional legal costs as may accrue on the same. 
                  (i)  The city may enforce the collection of any amount due on such lien for removal or demolition of dwellings, buildings or structures in the following manner: 
                  (1)  The owner or parties at interest shall be allowed to satisfy the amount due on such lien by paying to the city, within 30 days after the perfection of said lien, a sum of money equal to 25 percent of the total amount due and by further paying to the city the remaining balance due on such lien, together with interest at the rate of seven percent per annum, in three equal annual payments, each of which shall become due and payable on the anniversary date of the initial payment made as hereinabove prescribed;

                  For purposes of O.C.G.A. § 41-2-9, the court shall make its determination of "reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building or structure" without consideration of the value of the land on which the structure is situated; provided, however, that costs of the preparation necessary to repair, alter, or improve a structure may be considered. Income and financial status of the owner shall not be a factor in the court's determination. The present value of the structure and the costs of the repair, alteration, or improvement may be established by affidavits of real estate appraisers with a state appraiser classification as provided in O.C.G.A. § 43-39A-1 et seq., qualified building contractors, or qualified building inspectors without actual testimony presented. Costs or repair, alteration, or improvement of the structure shall be the cost necessary to bring the structure into compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violations in force in the jurisdiction.

                  If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair or demolish the dwelling, building or structure, the public officer may cause such dwelling, building or structure to be repaired, altered or improved or to be vacated and closed or demolished. The building and code manager shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of the building, dwelling, or structure a placard with the following words: 
                  "This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial or business use and does not comply with the applicable codes or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with drug crimes or constitutes an endangerment to public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful."

                  If the building and code manager has the structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any money received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. The building and code manager and the city are relieved of any and all liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials.

                  The amount of the cost of demolition, including all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the tax commissioner, and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, including restoration to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred.

                  Sec. 26-96. - Lien to attach upon filing of order. 
                  The lien provided for in section 26-95 shall attach to the real property upon the filing of a certified copy of the order requiring repair, closure, or demolition in the office of the clerk of superior court in the county where the real property is located and shall relate back to the filing of the lis pendens notice required under O.C.G.A. § 4-2-12(g). The clerk of superior court shall record and index such certified copy of the order in the deed records of the county and enter the lien on the general execution docket. The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except liens for taxes to which the lien shall be interior, and shall continue in force until paid. After filing a certified copy of the order with the clerk of superior court, the public officer shall forward a copy of the order and a final statement of costs to the county tax commissioner. It shall be the duty of the county tax commissioner to collect the amount of the lien in conjunction with the collection of ad valorem taxes, including specifically, O.C.G.A. § 48-4-1 et seq.; provided, however, that the limitation of O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 which requires 12 months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure shall not apply. The tax commissioner shall remit the amount collected to the governing authority of the city. Thirty days after imposition of the lien, the unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes. The tax commissioner shall collect and retain an amount equal to the cost of administering a lien authorized by O.C.G.A. § 41-2-1 et seq., unless such costs are waived by resolution of the county governing authority. Any such amount collected and retained for administration shall be deposited in the general fund of the county to pay the cost of administering the lien. Where the abatement action does not commence in the superior court, review of a court order requiring the repair, alteration, improvement or demolition of a dwelling, building or structure shall be by direct appeal to the superior court under O.C.G.A. § 5-3-29.

                  (7)  The plan of the event as proposed is likely to present a danger to the health or safety of participants in the event or other members of the public (though not through the agency of any predicted reaction by onlookers or members of the public);

Upon such notification, or at the city's own initiative, the city must commence the following process: 
                  (1)  The city manager shall review and evaluate the future cable-related community needs and interests and the franchisee's past performance. The review and evaluation process must include opportunity for public comment.

The notice must specify the information to be included in the renewal application and the deadline for filing the application, which must be no earlier than 30 calendar days following the date of the notice. If the franchisee does not submit a renewal application by the specified date, it will be deemed not to be seeking renewal of its franchise. 
                  (3)  Upon receipt of the renewal application, the city manager shall publish notice of its receipt and may schedule one or more public meetings or implement other procedures under which comments from the public on the application may be received.

                  (1)  The cable operator has substantially complied with the material terms of the existing franchise and with applicable law; 
                  (2)  The quality of the cable operator's service, including signal quality, response to consumer complaints, and billing practices (but without regard to the mix, quality, or level of cable services or other services provided over the system) has been reasonable in light of community needs; 
                  (3)  The cable operator has the financial, legal and technical ability to provide the services, facilities, and equipment set forth in its proposal; and 
                  (4)  The cable operator's proposal is reasonable to meet the future cable-related community needs and interests, taking into account the cost of meeting such needs and interests. 
                  (c)  The commission shall hold at least one public hearing to consider the application. The city manager may make recommendations to the commission prior to its consideration, a copy of which recommendations shall be made available to the franchisee in advance of the commission's consideration. Following the public hearing on the renewal application, the city commission must either: 
                  (1)  Pass a resolution agreeing to renew the franchise, subject to the negotiation of a franchise agreement satisfactory to the city and the franchisee, or 
                  (2)  Pass a resolution that makes a preliminary assessment that the franchise should not be renewed. 
                  (d)  The city commission's action under subsection (c) of this section must be taken within four months of the date of the renewal application notice to the franchisee required in subsection (a)(2) of this section. 
                  (e)  If a preliminary assessment is made that a franchise should not be renewed, at the request of the franchisee or on its own initiative, the city must commence an administrative proceeding in accordance with section 626(c) of the Cable Act (47 USC 546(c)). 
                  (f)  The city shall commence an administrative proceeding, initiated by a hearing order issued by the city manager or the commission which establishes the issues to be addressed in the hearing and the procedures to be followed and appoints a presiding officer for the hearing. Upon the completion of the hearing, the presiding officer shall issue a recommended decision. Parties to the hearing and the public shall have 30 calendar days to comment on the recommended decision after its issuance. 
                  (g)  Based on the recommended decision, the comment and arguments presented, and other evidence of record, the commission, following a public hearing, shall make a final determination on whether to grant or deny the renewal application. The commission shall issue a written decision setting forth the reasons for its decision. 
                  (h)  The provisions of subsections (a) through (g) of this section notwithstanding, a franchisee may submit a proposal for renewal of a franchise in accordance with 47 USC 546(h). The city must hold one or more public hearings or implement other procedures under which comments on the proposal from the public may be received. Following such public hearings or other procedures, the city commission shall determine whether the franchise should be renewed and the terms and conditions of any renewal. 
                  (i)  Once the commission grants a renewal application, the city and the franchisee must agree on a franchise agreement, pursuant to the procedures specified in section 36-57(e) through (j), before the renewal becomes effective. 
                  (j)  If renewal of a franchise is denied, the city may acquire ownership of the cable system or effect a transfer of ownership of the system to another person upon approval of the commission. Any such acquisition by the city must be at fair market value, determined on the basis of the cable system valued as a going concern but with no value allocated to the franchise itself. 
                  (k)  If renewal of a franchise is denied and the city does not purchase the cable system, the city may require the former franchisee to remove its facilities and equipment. If the former franchisee fails to do so within a reasonable period of time, the city may have the removal done at the former franchisee's and/or surety's expense.

If within 30 calendar days following written notice from the city to the franchisee that it is in material breach of this article or the franchise agreement, the franchisee has not taken corrective action or corrective action is not being actively and expeditiously pursued, the city commission, acting on its own motion or upon the recommendation of the city manager, may give written notice to the franchisee of its intent to consider revocation of the franchise stating its reason. 
                  (b)  Before final action can be taken, the commission shall hold a public hearing at which time the franchisee and members of the public must be given an opportunity to present evidence and make argument. Following the public hearing the commission shall determine whether or not to revoke the franchise based on any recommended decision, the evidence and argument presented at the hearing, and other evidence or record. The commission's determination shall be reflected in a written opinion setting forth the reasons for its decision. 
                  (c)  Any franchise may, at the option of the city, be revoked 120 calendar days after an assignment for the benefit of creditors or the appointment of a receiver or trustee to take over the business of the franchisee, whether in a receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy assignment for the benefit of creditors, or other action or proceeding, unless within that 120-day period:

                  (2)  The successful bidder has covenanted and agreed with the city to assume and be bound by the terms and conditions of the franchise.

Other matters that are arbitrable under the provisions of a franchise agreement may be subjected to the arbitration procedures specified in subsection (b) of this section. 
                  (b)  The arbitration procedure employed shall be consistent with the rules and procedures of the American Arbitration Association.

The franchisee must cooperate with the city to operate the system for a temporary period following termination or transfer as necessary to maintain continuity of service to all subscribers. The temporary period will not exceed six months without the franchisee's written consent. During such period, the cable system must be operated under such terms and conditions as the city and the franchisee may agree, or such other terms and conditions that will continue, to the extent possible, the same level of service to subscribers and that will provide reasonable compensation to the cable operator.

The city manager shall require that the franchisee give notice to its subscribers of the amount of the rate increase; the time, date and place of the hearing; and the manner by which persons may make written comments or appear before the commission. Such notice shall be given in writing to each subscriber not less than 14 days prior to the date of the hearing. The city manager may also require that the franchisee air notices over the cable system. 
                  (3)  At the public hearing members of the public and the franchisee shall be permitted to make arguments and provide comments. The commission shall also consider any written comments which may have been submitted. Following the public hearing the commission shall either approve or disapprove the rate increase sought or it may approve an increase less than that sought by the franchisee. In considering a proposed rate increase, the commission may take into consideration factors such as the cost of investment capital, rates or return on other businesses, the efficiency of the franchisee's operation, and the adequacy reliability and quality of the service provided by the franchisee.

                  (b)  The franchisee shall have no control over the content of the programming carried on access channels.

Such rules shall be subject to review and approval by the city. 
                  (c)  The city may, at the request of a franchisee, promulgate rules under which channel capacity dedicated to governmental access use may be used by the franchisee when it is not being used for access purposes.

                  (b)  The commission has the sole authority to: grant franchises, authorize the execution of franchise agreements, renew franchises, revoke franchises, and authorize the transfer of franchises.

                  (a)  This article shall be applicable to all cable franchises issued by the city, whether or not such franchises were issued prior to June 6, 1989.

The city will formally notify the franchisee as to whether or not it agrees with the franchisee's interpretation. Failure of such a franchisee to so notify the city within that time period shall preclude the franchisee from later claiming any exception from adherence to all provisions of this article. The ordinance from which this article is derived shall be effective when finally approved by the city commission.

                  (1)  The parade will be of a size or nature that requires the diversion of an excessive number of police officers of the city that allowing the parade would deny reasonable police protection to the city.

If a permit is so revoked, the permittee shall be allowed to reapply for a new parade permit. 
                  (h)  Bond of applicant. If it is the official position of the chief of police that additional personnel shall be required for traffic and pedestrian control, the city manager shall require the applicant to post a bond in an amount deemed by the city manager sufficient for and conditioned on the payment by the applicant of the additional costs incurred by the city for such service.

                  (1)  The building sewer shall be cast iron soil pipe, ASTM (American Society of Testing and Materials) Specification A74, latest revision, or equal; ductile iron pipe, American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Specification A21.51, latest revision, or equal; or polyvinyl chloride (PVC) sewer pipe, ASTM Specification D3034, latest revision. All joints shall be tight and waterproof. 
                  (2)  Any part of the building sewer that is located within ten feet of a water service pipe shall be constructed of cast iron soil pipe or ductile iron pipe with bolted mechanical joints. If installed in filled or unstable ground, the building sewer shall be of cast iron soil pipe, except that plastic pipe may be acceptable is laid on a suitable concrete bed or cradle upon advance approval by the city manager. 
                  (3)  The size and slope of the building sewer shall be subject to the approval of the city manager, but in no event shall the diameter be less than four inches. The slope of such four-inch pipe shall not be less than one-eighth inch per foot. Furthermore, the applicable requirements of the Occupational Health and Safety Act (OSHA) shall be followed. 
                  (4)  The depth shall be sufficient to afford protection from frost, and the building sewer shall be laid at uniform grade and with straight alignment insofar as possible. Changes in direction shall be made only with properly curved pipe and fittings. Building sewers shall not be placed in the same trench with water service lines. 
                  (5)  An excavation required for the installation of a building sewer shall be open trench work unless otherwise approved by the city manager. Pipe laying and backfill shall be performed in accordance with ASTM Specification C12, latest revision, except that no backfill shall be placed until the work has been inspected and approved by the city manager. 
                  (6)  All joints and connections shall be made gas tight and watertight. 
                  a.  Push-on joints for cast iron soil pipe shall have neoprene gaskets in accordance with the requirements of ASTM C-564. 
                  b.  Push-on joints for ductile iron pipe shall also have neoprene gaskets and be installed according to the manufacturer's recommendations. 
                  c.  PVC pipe joint material shall be of the bell and spigot type, sealed with a rubber "O"-ring gasket, having a composition and texture which is resistant to the common ingredients of sewage, industrial wastes (including oils), and groundwater, and which will endure permanently under the conditions likely to be imposed by this use. Installation of gasket shall be done in accordance with the pipe manufacturer's instructions using all the necessary materials, lubricants, and equipment recommended by the manufacturer. 
                  d.  Other jointing materials may be used only when approved by the city manager. 
                  (h)  The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall be made at the "Y" branch, if such a branch is available at a suitable location. If the public sewer is 12 inches in diameter or less, and no properly located "Y" branch is available, the city shall, at the owner's expense, cut a neat hole into the public sewer, with entry in the downstream direction at an angle of about 45 degrees, and install a 45-degree elbow with the spigot end cut so as not to extend past the inner surface of the public sewer. The invert of the building sewer at the point of connection shall be at an elevation of at least 0.1 foot above the invert of the public sewer. A neat smooth joint shall be made, and the connection made secure and watertight by encasement in concrete. Special fittings may be used for the connection only when approved by the city manager. 
                  (i)  Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the building at an elevation below the basement floor. No building sewer shall be laid parallel to or within three feet of any bearing wall which might thereby be weakened. In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such building drain shall be laid by an approved means and discharged to the building sewer. 
                  (j)  No person shall make connection of roof down spouts, foundation drains, areaway drains, or other sources of surface runoff or groundwater to a building sewer or a building drain which in turn is connected directly or indirectly to a public sanitary sewer unless such connection is approved by the city manager for purposes of disposal of polluted surface drainage. 
                  (k)  The applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify the city manager when the building sewer is ready for inspection and connection to the public sewer. The connection and testing shall be made under the supervision of the city manager. 
                  (l)  All excavations for building sewer installation shall be adequately guarded with barricades and lights so as to protect the public from hazard. Streets, sidewalks, parkways, and other public property shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the city. 
                  (m)  From time to time by resolution approved by the city commission, the city will define the availability of sewers and establish costs, fees, and charges associated with sewer permits or construction. 
                  (n)  The connection of the property sewer into the public sewer shall conform to the requirements of the building code, plumbing code and other applicable rules and regulations of the city or if the city has not adopted applicable codes, rules and regulations the procedure set forth in appropriate specifications of ASTM and the WEF Manual of Practice No. 9. All such connections shall be made gastight and watertight and verified by proper testing. Any deviation from the prescribed procedures and materials are subject to approval by the city manager before installation. 
                  (o)  If any private sewer permits the entrance of infiltration or inflow to the public sewer, the city may: 
                  (1)  Require the owner to repair the private sewer; 
                  (2)  Charge the owner a sewer rate that reflects the costs of the additional expense of sewage treatment from the owner's property; 
                  (3)  Require the owner to disconnect his sewer from the city sewer system; or 
                  (4)  Any combination of subsections (o)(1), (2) and (3) of this section. 
                  (Code 1977, § 32-116; Ord. No. 01-02, § 2, 1-16-2001) 
                  Sec. 40-96. - Restricted use of the public sewers. 
                  (a)  A user may not introduce into any public sewer any pollutant which cause pass through or interference of the POTW. These general prohibitions and the specific prohibitions in subsection (d) of this section apply to each user introducing pollutants into the POTW whether or not the user is subject to other national pretreatment standards or any national, state, or local pretreatment requirements. 
                  (b)  No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any unpolluted waters such as stormwater, groundwater, roof runoff, subsurface drainage, cooling water, or unpolluted industrial process waters to any sanitary sewer. 
                  (c)  Stormwater and all other unpolluted drainage shall be discharged to such sewers as are specifically designated storm sewers or to a natural outlet. Industrial cooling water or unpolluted process water may be discharged, upon approval of the state environmental protection division, to a storm sewer or natural outlet. 
                  (d)  Specific prohibitions. Except as herein provided, no person shall discharge any of the following described waters or wastes into any public sewer: 
                  (1)  Pollutants which create a fire or explosion hazard in the POTW, including, but not limited to, waste streams with a closed cup flash point of less than 140 degrees Fahrenheit or 60 degrees Celsius using the test methods specified in 40 CFR 261.21. 
                  (2)  Pollutants which will cause corrosive or structural damage to the POTW; but in no case discharges with pH lower than 5.0, or higher than 9.5. 
                  (3)  Solids or viscous pollutants in amounts which will cause obstruction to the flow in the POTW resulting in interference. 
                  (4)  Any pollutant, including oxygen demanding pollutants (BOD, etc.) released in a discharge at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration which will cause interference with the POTW. 
                  (5)  Heat in amounts which will inhibit biological activity in the POTW resulting in interference, but in no case heat in such quantities that the temperature at the POTW plant influent exceeds 40 degrees Celsius or 104 degrees Fahrenheit. 
                  (6)  Petroleum oil, non-biodegradable cutting oil, or products of mineral oil that will cause interference or pass through at the POTW. 
                  (7)  Pollutants which will result in the presence of toxic gases, vapors, or fumes within the POTW in quantities that may cause acute worker health and safety problems. Any noxious or malodorous gas or substance, capable of creating a public nuisance or preventing entry into sewers for their maintenance, inspection, and repair. 
                  (8)  Any trucked or hauled pollutants, except at discharge points designated by the POTW. 
                  (9)  Any waters or wastes containing in excess of 1.0 milligram per liter of any of the following hazardous or dangerous gases: hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide, or nitrous oxide. 
                  (10)  Any nondomestic waters, wastes or materials containing toxic organic and inorganic priority pollutants, unless issued a written permit by the city manager which provides numerical limits on the quantity of such pollutants. Such limits will be calculated based on national pretreatment standards, local conditions of the POTW; and the presence of any pollutants causing pass through or interference with the POTW. 
                  (11)  Any waters containing quantities of radium, naturally occurring or artificially produced radioisotopes in excess of presently existing or subsequently accepted limits for drinking water as established by the National Committee on Radiation Protection and Measuring. 
                  (12)  Any concentrated dye wastes, or other wastes which are highly colored, and adversely affect the treated effluent of the POTW. 
                  (13)  Detergents, surfactants, or other substances which may cause excessive foaming in the POTW. 
                  (e)  Local discharge limits. 
                  (1)  Using EPA approved methodology the city has established local discharge limits for the pollutants of concern to the POTW. These limits are designed to protect the receiving stream, prevent interference with POTW operations and protect the quality of the sludge produced by the POTW. These limits apply to all users of the system. The local discharge limits for pollutants of concern are shown in the table below. Discharge limits for these and other pollutants by industrial customers will be determined individually based on specific pollutants identified in the wastewater discharge permit application and current loading rates. For industrial users subject to national categorical pretreatment standards, the local limit will be compared to the categorical limit and the lower value will be used. The city reserves the right to set higher discharge limits for individual industrial users provided that the following conditions apply: 
                  a.  There are no other industrial users discharging the pollutant of concern or if there are other significant industrial users discharging the pollutant of concern they are discharging below the established limit; 
                  b.  If any other significant industrial users are discharging the pollutant of concern they agree to accept a lower limit; and 
                  c.  The total combined loading on the POTW will not exceed the established maximum head works loading. 
                  Pollutants of Concern 

                   
                  Surcharge limit/maximum discharge limit (see Surcharges) 
                  (2)  The city may impose mass limitations in addition to, or in place of, the concentration limits shown in the table above. Any user which desires to have a higher local discharge limit, will petition the city manager in writing in advance. 
                  (3)  Any discharge to the POTW that contains concentrations of conventional pollutants above the local discharge limit will be subject to surcharges as provided in this division. For purposes of this division, conventional pollutants are considered total kjeldahl nitrogen, biochemical oxygen demand, total suspended solids, and oil and grease. 
                  (f)  Surcharges. 
                  (1)  The concentration of conventional pollutants, determined by the city, shall be used to compute the monthly surcharges. The surcharges shall be based on metered potable water flow unless effluent flow monitoring is conducted. 
                  (2)  The minimum criterion for establishment of the surcharge rate shall be the amount necessary to recover the additional annual operation and maintenance cost for providing collection and treatment of wastewater in excess of domestic wastewater concentrations. 
                  (3)  The surcharge rates for BOD5, suspended solids, TKN, and FOG shall be established periodically by the city. The rate may be different for wastes hauled to the POTW from outside the city's service area. 
                  (4)  No user shall discharge wastewater to the POTW with a BOD5 concentration in excess of 200 mg/l, a suspended solids concentration in excess of 200 mg/l, fat oil and grease concentration in excess of (100 mg/l) or TKN in excess of 35 mg/l without paying the surcharge and sewer user charges hereinafter imposed. 
                  (5)  Discharge of wastewater with a BOD5 in excess of 1,000 mg/l, and/or suspended solids in excess of 1,000 mg/l, and/or fat oil and grease in excess of 300 mg/l, and/or a TKN in excess of 50 mg/l shall be prohibited. 
                  (6)  The surcharge rates shall be a cost-per-pound-of-BOD5-and/or-suspended-solids-and/or fats oil and grease and/or TKN figure. This rate shall be multiplied by the pounds of five-day BOD5, suspended solids, oil and grease, and TKN discharged to the sanitary sewer each month by the user over and above levels established in this section. 
                  (7)  The surcharge rate schedule will be set annually by the city and will be available for review in the city engineer's office. The surcharge, and any fines, shall be billed monthly by the city with the normal user charge. The conditions for payment and penalties applicable to the normal user charge shall apply to the surcharge. If the city should fail to set a surcharge rate for any year, the surcharge for the previous period shall apply. 
                  (8)  A surcharge typically will not be assessed for COD. However, if COD is shown to degrade in the POTW and to cause an excessive oxygen demand, a site specific surcharge will be established based on the cost of treatment. 
                  All other regulated pollutants are considered non-conventional pollutants and any discharge to the POTW that contains concentrations of these pollutant above the local discharge limit will be subject to enforcement action as provided in this division.

                  Sec. 40-97. - National categorical pretreatment standards. 
                  The categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR 405—471 are hereby incorporated. 
                  (1)  Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the director of public works may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(c). 
                  (2)  When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the director of public works shall impose an alternate limit using the combined waste stream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e). 
                  (3)  A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard if the user can prove pursuant to the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13, that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when developing the categorical pretreatment standard. 
                  (4)  A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15. 
                  (5)  Except where expressly authorized to do so by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement, no industrial user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any other way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a pretreatment standard or requirement. The city may impose mass limitations on industrial users which are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases where the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. 
                  (Code 1977, § 32-118; Ord. No. 01-02, § 2, 1-16-2001) 
                  Sec. 40-98. - Industrial pretreatment requirements. 
                  (a)  Pretreatment of wastewater. 
                  (1)  Pretreatment facilities. Users shall provide wastewater treatment as necessary to comply with this division and shall achieve compliance with all categorical pretreatment standards, local limits, and the prohibitions set out in section 40-96 within the time limitations specified by EPA, the state, or the director of public works, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities necessary for compliance shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans describing such facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the city manager for review, and shall be subject to approval by the city manager before such facilities are constructed. The review of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the city under the provisions of this division. 
                  (2)  Additional pretreatment measures. 
                  a.  Whenever deemed necessary, the city manager may require users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage waste streams from industrial waste streams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine the user's compliance with the requirements of this division. 
                  b.  The city manager may require users to install and maintain, on their own property and at their expense, a suitable storage and flow control facility to ensure equalization of flow. A wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization. 
                  c.  The city manager may require users to install and maintain, on their own property and at their expense, a sampling manhole. 
                  d.  Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter. 
                  (3)  Accidental discharge/slug control plans. At least once every two years, the director of public works of the city shall evaluate whether each significant industrial user needs an accidental discharge/slug control plan. The city manager may require any user to develop, submit for approval, and implement such a plan. Alternatively, the director of public works may develop such a plan for any user. An accidental discharge/slug control plan shall address, at a minimum, the following: 
                  a.  Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch discharges; 
                  b.  Description of stored chemicals; 
                  c.  Procedures for immediately notifying the POTW superintendent of any accidental or slug discharge, as required by subsection (d)(6)a of this section. 
                  d.  Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency response. 
                  (4)  Hauled waste. 
                  a.  Septic tank waste may be introduced into the POTW only at locations designated by the director of public works, and at such times as are established by the city manager. Such wastes shall not violate section 40-96 or any other requirements established by the city. The city manager may require septic tank waste haulers to obtain wastewater discharge permits. Such permits may be revoked at any time if, in the opinion of the director, continued dumping of such matter into the sewers will be injurious to the sewer system or treatment processes. 
                  b.  A charge shall be made for the privilege of dumping the contents of septic tanks, as provided in separate rules. A record shall be kept of such dumps and statements rendered at the first of each month, the amount of such statements shall be payable within ten days after rendition. Failure to pay the amounts due within such ten-day period shall be cause for revoking the permit. 
                  c.  The city shall require haulers of industrial waste to obtain wastewater discharge permits. The director of public works may require generators of hauled industrial waste to obtain wastewater discharge permits. The city manager also may prohibit the disposal of hauled industrial waste. The discharge of hauled industrial waste is subject to all other requirements of this division. 
                  d.  Industrial waste haulers may discharge loads only at locations designated by the city. No load may be discharged without prior consent of the city. The city may collect samples of each hauled load to ensure compliance with applicable standards. The city may require the industrial waste hauler to provide a waste analysis of any load prior to discharge. 
                  (5)  Grease interceptors. 
                  a.  Required for food service facilities. 
                  1.  All food service facilities shall install an approved, properly operated and maintained grease interceptor which shall protect the drainage and wastewater collection systems from substances that might block or otherwise be harmful to those systems in addition to preventing the back passage of gases from drainage systems into a building. 
                  2.  Food service facilities include, but are not limited to, restaurants, cafeterias, cafes, fast food outlets, schools, fraternal organizations, churches, hospitals, day-care centers and any and all other facilities having the capability to engage in food preparation. 
                  3.  In-line interior grease traps shall not be permitted unless approved by the city manager or his designee. Exceptions to the grease interceptor requirement shall be only by written variance granted by the city after approval of a plan for capturing grease, oil and other substances on the user's premises and for proper disposal of same. 
                  b.  The grease interceptor design criteria shall comply with the requirements established by the city and the state and shall be approved by the city. The size of the interceptor shall comply with the city wastewater quality control procedures for sizing of grease interceptors and in no event be less than 1,500 gallons. 
                  c.  Each grease interceptor shall be installed and connected so that it is easily accessible for inspection, cleaning and removal of the intercepted grease at all times. A grease interceptor shall be installed outside. Any variance shall be in writing from the city upon a showing by the owner, to the satisfaction of the city, that an outdoor interceptor is not feasible. 
                  d.  Maintenance of grease interceptors shall be the sole responsibility of the owner or operator to ensure proper operation in preventing any obstruction, interference or damage to the collection system. Maintenance, trap pumping and disposal manifest records shall be kept on site for three consecutive years and a copy of each record shall be forward to the city pretreatment coordinator within five days of maintenance and/or pumping. 
                  e.  All persons pumping and disposing of contents of grease interceptors shall remove the entire contents of holding tank/interceptor. Contents shall be hauled and disposed off site. Pumping frequency of all grease interceptors shall be once every three months unless the city determines more frequent pumping and disposal is needed for specific sites. 
                  f.  The city shall inspect all grease interceptors or other approved trap facilities to ensure compliance with requirements mandated by the city and the state. Each site shall be inspected at least one time in every six-month period unless the city determines more frequent inspection is necessary to ensure compliance. In the inspection process, the following criteria shall be considered but shall not be the sole criteria. Said criteria, if applicable to the facility, include: 
                  1.  Location and accessibility; 
                  2.  Capacity; 
                  3.  Identification of inlet and outlet compartments; 
                  4.  Identification of inlet and outlet piping systems;

                  6.  Identification of bacterial or enzymatic uses; 
                  7.  Approximate depth of accumulated solids and grease layer; and 
                  8.  Verification of maintenance records. 
                  g.  Best management practices and inspections. 
                  1.  Existing sources not connected to grease interceptors or those sources connected to in-line interior grease traps, which contribute significant quantities of oil and grease wastes, shall be required to implement best management practices (BMPs). "Significant quantities" shall be at the sole determination of the city. In the event BMPs do not successfully reduce quantities of oil and grease wastes being introduced to the collection system, those sources shall be subject to installation of upgrade grease interceptors. 
                  2.  Best management practices inspections shall include, but are not limited to, the following, if applicable to the facility: 
                  (i)  Identification and description of plumbing fixtures; 
                  (ii)  Identification of facility grease reduction procedures; 
                  (iii)  Identification of facility grease rendering container; 
                  (iv)  Identification of in-line interior grease trap; 
                  (v)  Verification of in-line interior grease trap maintenance records;

                  (viii)  Facility hours of operation; and 
                  (ix)  Facility schedule of routine drain line maintenance. 
                  3.  Existing sources not connected to grease interceptors or those sources connected to in-line interior grease traps, which do not contribute significant quantities or oil and grease wastes, may be granted a written waiver to the inspection criteria. The waiver shall apply only and strictly to the named facility owner/operator located at the named facility address if the initial inspection is exemplary and said waiver is approved by the city. In no event shall a waiver be given to a facility that cooks or prepares food, other than precooked meals or sandwiches only, on the premises. 
                  h.  The city shall provide written notices to all facilities following their inspection. Those facilities determined to be in violation of the city requirements shall be provided written notice of noncompliance. The facility shall have not more than 14 days to correct any deficiencies and be subject to a follow-up inspection to ensure compliance. Failure to comply after this period may subject the facility to fines, penalties, or service disconnection, business license revocation and closure. 
                  (b)  Wastewater discharge permit application. 
                  (1)  Wastewater analysis. When requested by the city manager, a user must submit information on the nature and characteristics of its wastewater within 90 days of the request. The city manager is authorized to prepare a form for this purpose and may periodically require users to update responses to this information.

                  (i)  The categorical pretreatment standards applicable to each regulated process. 
                  (ii)  The results of sampling and analysis identifying the nature and concentration, and/or mass, where required by the standard or by the director of public works, of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process. Instantaneous, daily maximum, and long term average concentrations, or mass, where required, shall be reported. The sample provided shall be representative of daily operations and shall be analyzed in accordance with procedures set out in subsection (d)(10) of this section. 
                  (iii)  Sampling must be performed in accordance with procedures set out in subsection (d)(11) of this section. 
                  6.  Certification. A statement, reviewed by the user's authorized representative and certified by a qualified professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not, whether additional operation and maintenance (OandM) and/or additional pretreatment is required to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements. 
                  7.  Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or OandM will be required to meet the pretreatment standards, the shortest schedule by which the user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or OandM. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment standard. A compliance schedule pursuant to this subsection must meet the requirements set out in subsection (d)(2)a of this section. 
                  8.  Signature and certification. All baseline monitoring reports must be signed and certified in accordance with subsection (b)(7) of this section. 
                  (2)  Compliance schedule progress reports. The following conditions shall apply to the compliance schedule required by subsection (d)(1)b.7 of this section. 
                  a.  The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the applicable pretreatment standards (such events include, but are not limited to, hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts for major comments, commencing and completing construction, and beginning and conducting routine operation); 
                  b.  No increment referred to in subsection (d)(2)a of this section shall exceed nine months; 
                  c.  The user shall submit a progress report to the city manager no later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final date of compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate, the steps being taken by the user to return to the established schedule; and 
                  d.  In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress reports to the city manager. 
                  (3)  Reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadline. Within 90 calendar days following the date for final compliance with applicable pretreatment standards or, in the case of a new source, following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any user subject to pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the city a report containing the information described in subsection (d)(1)b of this section. For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR 403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long term production rate. For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with subsection (b)(7) of this section. 
                  (4)  Periodic compliance reports. 
                  a.  All significant industrial users shall, at a frequency determined by the city but in no case less than twice per year, submit a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with subsection (b)(7) of this section. 
                  b.  All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
                  c.  If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the city, using the procedures prescribed in subsection (d)(11) of this section, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report. 
                  (5)  Reports of changed conditions. Each user must notify the city of any planned significant changes to the user's operations or system which might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater at least 90 days before the change. 
                  a.  The city may require the user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including, without limitation, the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under subsection (b) of this section. 
                  b.  The city may issue a wastewater discharge permit under subsection (c) of this section or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under subsection (c)(4) of this section in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions. 
                  c.  For purposes of this requirement, significant changes include, but are not limited to, flow increases of 20 percent or greater, and the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants. 
                  (6)  Reports of potential problems. 
                  a.  In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch discharge, or a slug load, that may cause potential problems for the POTW; the user shall immediately telephone or personally notify the plant superintendent of the incident. This notification shall include the time and location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user and such additional information that the city may reasonably request. 
                  b.  Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless waived by the city, submit a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this division. 
                  c.  A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a discharge described in subsection (d)(6)a of this section. Employers shall ensure that all employees, who may cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the emergency notification procedure. 
                  (7)  Reports from unpermitted users. All users not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the city as the city may require. 
                  (8)  Notice of violation/repeat sampling and reporting. If sampling performed by the user indicates a violation, the user must notify the city within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the city within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. The user is not required to resample if the city monitors at the user's facility at least once a month, or if the city samples between the user's initial sampling and when the user receives the results of this sampling. 
                  (9)  Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste. 
                  a.  Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA regional waste management division director, and state environmental protection division hazardous waste program, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the waste stream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste stream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this subsection need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under subsection (d)(5) of this section. The notification requirement in this subsection (d)(9) does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of subsections (c)(2)a.4 and (e)(1)c of this section. 
                  b.  Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of subsection (d)(9)a of this section during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of non-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
                  c.  In the cases of any new regulations under section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the city, the EPA regional waste management division director, and state environmental protection division hazardous waste program discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations. 
                  d.  In the case of any notification made under this subsection (d)(9), the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
                  e.  This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this division, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law. 
                  (10)  Analytical requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CPR 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by EPA. 
                  (11)  Sample collection. 
                  a.  Except as indicated in subsection (d)(11)b. of this section, the user must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the city may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits. 
                  b.  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfide, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. 
                  (12)  Timing. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern. 
                  (13)  Recordkeeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this division shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this division and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, name of the person taking the samples; the dates analysis were performed; who performed the analysis; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analysis. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any administrative action or litigation concerning the user or the city, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the city. 
                  (e)  Compliance monitoring. 
                  (1)  Right of entry; inspection and sampling. The city shall have the right to enter the premises of any user to determine whether the user is complying with all requirements of this division and any wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder. Users shall allow the city ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties. 
                  a.  Where a user has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, the city personnel will be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities. 
                  b.  The city shall have the right to set up on the user's property, or require installation of, such devices as are reasonably necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's operations. 
                  c.  The city may require the user to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated on at least an annual basis to ensure their accuracy. 
                  d.  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user at the written or verbal request of the city and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the user. 
                  e.  Unreasonable delays in allowing the city access to the user's premises shall be a violation of this division. 
                  (2)  Search warrants. If the city has been refused access to a building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this division, or that there is need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program of the city designed to verify compliance with this division or any permit or order issued hereunder; or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the city may seek issuance of a search warrant or other appropriate writ from a court of competent jurisdiction. 
                  (f)  Confidential information. Information and data on a user obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits, monitoring programs, and from inspections shall be available to the public, EPD, EPA or other governmental agency without restriction unless the user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city, EPD, and EPA, that release of such information would divulge information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the user. Users wishing to keep such information confidential must assert a claim of confidentiality at the time the information is submitted to the city, such confidential information may be withheld from the public but it will always be made available to the EPD and/or EPA. Effluent data will be available to the public without restriction. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, any such information or data which is an open record as defined by the Georgia Open Record Act shall be subject to being produced pursuant to the terms of said Act. 
                  (g)  Publication of significant noncompliance. The city shall publish annually, in the largest daily newspaper published in the municipality where the POTW is located, a list of the users which, during the previous 12 months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. The term "significant noncompliance" means: 
                  (1)  Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which 66 percent or more of wastewater measurements taken during a six-month period exceed the daily maximum limit or average limit for the same pollutant parameter by any amount; 
                  (2)  Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which 33 percent or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant parameter during a six-month period equals or exceeds the product of the daily maximum limit or the average limit multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH); 
                  (3)  Any other discharge violation that the city believes has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through, including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public; 
                  (4)  Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment to the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the city's exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge; 
                  (5)  Failure to meet, within 90 days of the scheduled date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance; 
                  (6)  Failure to provide within 30 days after the due date, any required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules; 
                  (7)  Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or 
                  (8)  Any other violation which the city determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program. 
                  (h)  Service charges. The city commission may from time to time adopt charges and fees which may include: 
                  (1)  Fees for reimbursement of costs of setting up and operating the city's pretreatment program; 
                  (2)  Fees for monitoring, inspections and surveillance procedures; 
                  (3)  Fees for reviewing accidental discharge procedures and construction; 
                  (4)  Fees for permit applications; 
                  (5)  Fees for filing appeals; 
                  (6)  Fees for consistent removal (by the city) of pollutants otherwise subject to federal pretreatment standards; 
                  (7)  Other fees as the city may reasonably deem necessary to carry out the requirements contained herein. 
                  These fees relate solely to the matters covered by this division and are separate from all other fees chargeable by the city. The applicable charges shall be set forth in the city's schedule of charges and fees. 
                  (Code 1977, § 32-119; Ord. No. 01-02, § 2, 1-16-2001; Ord. No. 05-13, §§ 1, 2, 6-7-2005) 
                  Sec. 40-99. - Administrative enforcement remedies. 
                  (a)  Notification of violation. Whenever the city finds that any user has violated or is violating this division, or a wastewater permit or order issued hereunder, the city manager or his agent may serve upon said user written notice of violation. Within ten days of the receipt date of said notice, said user shall submit to the city manager or his designee an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. The city manager may reasonably request additional information concerning such violations. 
                  (b)  Consent orders. The city manager is hereby empowered to enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period also specified by the order. Consent orders shall have the same force and effect as compliance orders issued pursuant to subsection (d) of this section. 
                  (c)  Show cause hearing. The city manager may order any user which causes or contributes to violation of this division or wastewater permit or order issued hereunder, to show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user. Whether or not a duly notified user appears as noticed, immediate enforcement action may be pursued. 
                  (d)  Compliance order. When the city manager reasonably finds that a user has violated or continues to violate this division or a permit or order issued thereunder, he may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that, following a specified time period, sewer service shall be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances have been installed and are properly operated. Orders may also contain such other requirements as might be reasonably necessary and appropriate to address the noncompliance, including the installation of pretreatment technology; additional self-monitoring, and management practices. 
                  (e)  Cease and desist orders. When the city manager finds that a user has violated or continues to violate this division or any permit or order issued hereunder; the city manager may issue an order to cease and desist all such violations and direct those persons in noncompliance to: 
                  (1)  Comply forthwith; 
                  (2)  Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and terminating the discharge. 
                  (f)  Administrative fines. Notwithstanding any other section of this division, any user who is found to have violated any provision of this division, or permits or orders issued hereunder, shall be fined in an amount not to exceed $1,000.00 per violation. Each day on which noncompliance shall occur or continue shall be deemed a separate and distinct violation. Such assessments may be added to the user's next scheduled sewer service charge and the city shall have such other collection remedies as it needs to collect other individual user's property. Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a request for the city to reconsider the fine within ten days of being notified of the fine. Where the city manager believes a request has merit, he shall convene a hearing on the matter within 15 days of receiving the request from the industrial user. The decision on the appeal shall be the final administrative decision of the city. 
                  (g)  Emergency suspensions. 
                  (1)  The city manager may suspend the wastewater treatment service and/or wastewater permit of a user whenever such suspension is necessary in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge presenting or causing imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons, the POTW, or the environment. 
                  (2)  Any user notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment service and/or the wastewater permit shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the city manager shall take such steps as deemed necessary; including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The city manager shall allow the user to recommence its discharge when the endangerment has passed, unless termination proceedings set forth in subsection (h) of this section are initiated against the user. A user who is the subject of a suspension order under this subsection (g) shall have the right to appeal to the city manager from such suspension, but such suspension shall remain in full force and effect pending such hearing and the decision of the city manager thereto. 
                  (3)  A user which is responsible, in whole or in part, for imminent endangerment shall submit: 
                  a.  A detailed written statement describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence; and 
                  b.  Such other information that the city manager may reasonably request prior to the date of the hearing described in subsection (g)(2) of this section. 
                  (h)  Termination of permit. Significant industrial users proposing to discharge into the POTW, must first obtain a wastewater discharge permit from the city manager. Any user who violates the following conditions of this division or a wastewater discharge permit or order, or any applicable state and federal law, is subject to permit termination: 
                  (1)  Violation of permit conditions; 
                  (2)  Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge; 
                  (3)  Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater constituents and characteristics; or 
                  (4)  Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling. 
                  Noncompliant industrial users will be notified of the proposed termination of their wastewater permit and will be offered an opportunity to show cause under subsection (c) of this section why the proposed action should not be taken. 
                  (i)  Termination of services. The city may order any user who causes or continues to allow an unauthorized discharge to enter the POTW to show cause before the city commission as to why termination of services should not happen. A notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place of a hearing to be held by the city commission regarding the termination of services, the reasons why the action is to be taken, and directing the user to show cause before the city commission why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten days before the hearing. Service may be made on any agent or officer of a corporation. The city commission may itself conduct the hearing and take the evidence, or may designate any of its members or any officer or employee of the public works to: 
                  (1)  Issue in the name of the city commission notices of the hearing requesting the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence relevant to any matter involved in such hearings; 
                  (2)  Take the evidence; 
                  (3)  Transmit a report of the evidence and hearing, including transcripts and other evidence, together with recommendations to the city commission for action thereon. At any hearing held pursuant to this division, testimony must be taken under oath and recorded stenographically. The transcript, so recorded, will be made available to any member of the public or any party to the hearing upon payment of the usual charges thereof. 
                  After the city commission has reviewed the evidence, it may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that, following a specified time period, the sewer service be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are properly operated. Further orders and directives as are necessary and appropriate may be issued.

                  Sec. 40-100. - Judicial remedies. 
                  If any person discharges sewage, industrial wastes, or other wastes into the wastewater disposal system contrary to the provisions of this division or any order or permit issued hereunder, the city manager, through the city attorney, may commence an action for appropriate legal and/or equitable relief in the county court. 
                  (1)  Injunctive relief. Whenever a user has violated or continues to violate this division or any order or permit issued hereunder, the city, through counsel, may petition the court for its issuance of a preliminary or permanent injunction or both (as may be appropriate) which restrains or compels the activities on the part of the user. The city may also initiate nuisance abatement proceedings in any court of competent jurisdiction, as an alternate remedy. 
                  (2)  Civil penalties. 
                  a.  Any user who has violated or continues to violate this division or any order or permit issued hereunder shall be liable to the city for a civil penalty of up to at least $1,000.00 plus actual damages incurred by the POTW per violation per day for as long as the violation continues. In addition to the penalty and damages described in this subsection, the city may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with the enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses. 
                  b.  The city shall petition any court having jurisdiction to impose, assess, and recover such sums. In determining amount of liability, the court having jurisdiction shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factors as justice requires. 
                  (3)  Criminal prosecution. 
                  a.  Any user who willfully or negligently violates any provision of this division or any orders or permits issued hereunder shall, upon conviction in the municipal court, be guilty of a violation of this division, punishable by a fine not to exceed $1,000.00 per violation per day or imprisonment for not more than six months, either or both. 
                  b.  Any user who knowingly makes any false statements, representations, or certifications in any application, record, report, plan or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this division, or wastewater permit, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this division shall, upon conviction in the municipal court, be punished by a fine of not more than $500.00 per day or imprisonment for not more than six months, or both.

                  Sec. 40-101. - Supplemental enforcement remedies. 
                  (a)  Performance bonds. The city manager may decline to reissue a permit to any industrial user which has failed to comply with the provisions of this division or any order or previous permit issued hereunder unless such user files with it a bond reasonably satisfactory to the city manager, payable to the city, in a sum not to exceed a value determined by the city manager to be necessary to achieve consistent compliance. 
                  (b)  Liability insurance. The city manager may decline to reissue a permit to any industrial user which has failed to comply with the provisions of this division or any order or previous permit issued hereunder, unless the industrial user first submits proof that it has obtained financial assurances sufficient to restore or repair POTW damage caused by its discharge; the city manager may require an insurance certificate reasonably satisfactory to the city manager evidencing insurance coverage. 
                  (c)  Water supply severance. Whenever an industrial user has admitted or has been found after hearing to be in violation of the provisions of this division or an order issued hereunder, water service to the industrial user may be severed and service will only recommence, at the user's expense, after it has satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply. 
                  (Code 1977, § 32-122; Ord. No. 01-02, § 2, 1-16-2001) 
                  Sec. 40-102. - Affirmative defenses. 
                  (a)  Treatment upsets. 
                  (1)  For the purposes of this division, the term "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventative maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
                  (2)  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection (a)(3) of this section are met. 
                  (3)  A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
                  a.  An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause of the upset; 
                  b.  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 
                  c.  The user has submitted the following information to the city manager within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days): 
                  1.  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
                  2.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
                  3.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
                  (4)  In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
                  (5)  Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
                  (6)  Users shall control production of all discharges, to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. 
                  (b)  Treatment bypasses. 
                  (1)  For the purposes of this division: 
                  Bypass means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a user's treatment facility. 
                  Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. The term "severe property damage" does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
                  (2)  A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsections (b)(3) and (4) of this section. 
                  (3)  Prior notice; oral notice. 
                  a.  If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the director of public works, at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
                  b.  A user shall submit oral notice to the director of public works of an anticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The director of public works may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours. 
                  (4)  Bypass is prohibited, and the city manager may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless: 
                  a.  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage. 
                  b.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance. 
                  c.  The director of public works may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the director of public works determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (b)(4)a of this section. 
                  d.  The user submitted notices as required under subsection (b)(3) of this section. 
                  (c)  Prohibited discharge standards. A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in section 40-96 or the specific prohibitions in section 40-96(d) if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either: 
                  (1)  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or 
                  (2)  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.

If such building, structure, or premises is unoccupied, they shall first make a reasonable effort to locate the owner or other persons having charge or control of such and request entry. If entry is refused, the building and code manager shall have recourse to every remedy provided by law to secure entry. 
                  (2)  When the building and code manager shall have first obtained a proper inspection warrant or other remedy provided by law to secure entry, no owner or occupant or any other persons having charge, care, or control of any building, structure, or premises shall fail or neglect, after proper request is made as herein provided, to promptly permit entry therein by the building and code manager for the purpose of inspection and examination pursuant to these codes. 
                  (c)  Stop work orders.

                  (1)  Misrepresentation of application.

                  (2)  Violation of code provisions. The building and code manager may revoke a permit upon determination that the construction, erection, alteration, repair, moving, demolition, installation or replacement of the building, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical, or plumbing systems for which the permit was issued is in violation of, or not in conformity with, the provisions of these codes. 
                  (e)  Unsafe buildings or systems. All buildings, structures, electrical, gas, mechanical, or plumbing systems which are unsafe, unsanitary, or do not provide adequate egress, or which constitute a fire hazard, or are otherwise dangerous to human life, or which in relation to existing use, constitute a hazard to safety or health, are considered unsafe buildings or service systems. All such unsafe buildings, structures, or service systems are hereby declared illegal and shall be abated by repair and rehabilitation or by demolition in accordance with the provisions of the adopted International Property Maintenance Code.

Any requirements necessary for the strength, stability, or proper operation of an existing or proposed building, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical, or plumbing system, or for the public safety, health, and general welfare, not specifically covered by the technical codes, shall be determined by the building and code manager. 
                  (g)  Alternative materials and methods. The provisions of the technical codes are not intended to prevent the use of any material or method of construction not specifically prescribed by them, provided any such alternate has been reviewed by the building and code manager. He shall approve any such alternate, provided he finds that the alternate for the purpose intended is at least the equivalent of that prescribed in the technical codes, in quality, strength, effectiveness, fire resistance, durability, and safety.

                  Minimum Airgaps for Generally Used Plumbing Fixtures 

                   
                  Notes: 
                  1 Side walls, ribs, or similar obstructions do not affect airgaps when spaced from inside edge of spout opening a distance greater than three times the diameter of the effective opening for a single wall, or a distance greater than four times the diameter of the effective opening for two intersecting walls. 
                  2 Vertical walls, ribs, or similar obstructions extending from the water surface to or above the horizontal plane of the spout opening require a greater airgap when spaced closer to the nearest inside edge of spout opening than specified in note 1 above. The effect of three or more such vertical walls or ribs has not been determined. In such cases, the airgap shall be measured from the top of the wall. 
                  3 Two times diameter of effective opening. 
                  4 Three times diameter of effective opening. 
                  (i)  Approval of devices. 
                  (1)  Before any device for the prevention of backflow or backsiphonage is installed, it shall have first been certified by a recognized testing laboratory acceptable to the agency director. Devices installed in a building potable water supply distribution system for protection against backflow shall be maintained in good working condition by the person responsible for the maintenance of the system. 
                  (2)  The agency director or his designee shall inspect routinely such devices and if found to be defective or inoperative shall require the replacement thereof. 
                  (j)  Installation of devices. 
                  (1)  Vacuum breakers. Vacuum breakers shall be installed with the critical level at least six inches above the flood-level rim of the fixture they serve and on the discharge side of the last control valve to the fixture. No shutoff valve or faucet shall be installed beyond the vacuum breaker. For closed equipment or vessels such as pressure sterilizers the top of the vessel shall be treated as the flood-level rim but a check valve shall be installed on the discharge side of the vacuum breaker. 
                  (2)  Reduced pressure principle backflow preventer. A reduced pressure principle type backflow preventer may be installed subject to full static pressure. 
                  (3)  Devices of all types. Backflow and backsiphonage preventing devices shall be accessibly located, preferably in the same room with the fixture they serve. Installation in utility or service spaces, provided they are readily accessible, is also permitted. 
                  (k)  Tanks and vats, below rim supply. 
                  (1)  Where a potable water outlet terminates below the rim of a tank or vat and the tank or vat has an overflow of diameter not less than given in Table B, the overflow pipe shall be provided with an airgap as close to the tank as possible. 
                  Table B 
                  Sizes of Overflow Pipes for Water Supply Tanks 

                   
                  (2)  The potable water outlet to the tank or vat shall terminate a distance not less than 1½ times the height to which water can rise in the tank above the top of the overflow. This level shall be established at the maximum flow rate of the supply to the tank or vat and with all outlets except the airgap overflow outlet closed. 
                  (3)  The distance from the outlet to the high water level shall be measured from the critical point of the potable water supply outlet. 
                  (l)  Protective devices required. Approved devices to protect against backflow and backsiphonage shall be installed at all fixtures and equipment where backflow and/or backsiphonage may occur and where a minimum airgap cannot be provided between the water outlet to the fixture or equipment and its flood-level rim. 
                  (1)  Connections not subject to backpressure. Where a water connection is not subject to backpressure, a vacuum breaker shall be installed on the discharge side of the last valve on the line serving the fixture or equipment. A list of some conditions requiring protective devices of this kind is given in Table C below.

                  Note: "Critical level" (C-L) is defined as the level to which the vacuum breaker may be submerged before backflow will occur. Where the C-L is not shown on the preventer, the bottom of the device shall be taken as the C-L. 
                  (2)  Connections subject to backpressure. Where a potable water connection is made to a line, fixture, tank, vat, pump, or other equipment with a hazard of backflow or backsiphonage where the water connection is subject to backpressure, and an airgap cannot be installed, the director may require the use of an approved reduced pressure principle backflow preventer. A partial list of such connections is shown in Table D. 
                  Table D 
                  Partial List of Cross Connections Which May Be Subject to Backpressure 

                   
                  (m)  Barometric loop. Water connections where an actual or potential backsiphonage hazard exists may in lieu of devices specified in subsection (l) of this section be provided with a barometric loop. Barometric loops shall precede the point of connection. 
                  (n)  Double check, double gate valves. The director may authorize installation of approved, double check, double gate valve assemblies with test cocks as protective devices against backflow in connections between a potable water system and other fluid systems which present no significant health hazard in the judgment of the director. 
                  (o)  Low pressure cutoff required on booster pumps. When a booster pump is used on a water pressure booster system and the possibility exists that a positive pressure of ten psi or less may occur on the suction side of the pump, there shall be installed a low pressure cutoff on the booster pump to prevent the creation of a vacuum or negative pressure on the suction side of the pump, thus cutting off water to other outlets. 
                  (Code 1977, § 26-32; Ord. No. 84-4, § 1(3.1)—(3.8), 2-21-1984)

                  Sec. 103-212. - Permitted uses. 
                  Upon receipt of an appropriate building permit, freestanding communications towers may be located only in the zoning districts of the city as set forth in the city's zoning ordinance, or the same may be amended from time to time. 
                  (1)  Rooftop-mounted communications towers and antennae may be located on any nonresidential buildings and alternative tower structures in the city so long as: 
                  a.  Such tower or antenna is set back from any existing or planned off-site residence and separated from any residentially zoned property at least a distance equal to two times the full height of the tower and antenna, but in no event less than 100 feet; 
                  b.  The existing freestanding nonresidential structure other than a tower on which such tower or antenna will be placed is 50 feet in height or greater and the tower and antenna will add no more than 20 feet total to the height of said existing structure; 
                  c.  No advertising is permitted on an antenna or tower; 
                  d.  No signs or illumination are permitted on an antenna or tower unless required by the FCC, FAA or other state or federal agency of competent jurisdiction in which case the building and code manager may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding uses and views; and 
                  e.  The number and location of antennae, communications towers or other receiving or transmitting devices located on a single structure is not excessive and does not adversely affect adjacent properties and views. 
                  (2)  Prohibitions. No new cell may be established if there is a technically suitable space available on an existing tower within the search area that the new cell is to serve. For the purpose of this article, the search area is defined as the grid for the placement of the antenna. 
                  (Code 1977, § 7-123; Ord. No. 97-01, § 1, 1-6-1997) 
                  Sec. 103-213. - General requirements. 
                  The requirements set forth in this section shall govern the location and construction of all towers, and the installation of all antennae, governed by this article. 
                  (1)  Building codes; safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity of communications towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes and the applicable standards for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries Association, as amended from time to time. Tower owners shall conduct periodic inspections of communications towers at least once every three years to ensure structural integrity. Inspections shall be conducted by a structural engineer licensed to practice in the state. The results of such inspection shall be provided to the building and code manager. 
                  (2)  Regulatory compliance. 
                  a.  All towers and antennae must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC and any other agency of the state or federal government with the authority to regulate communications towers and antennae. If such standards and regulations are changed then the owners of the communications towers and antennae governed by this article shall bring such communications towers and antennae into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six months of the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a more stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal agency. 
                  b.  Tower owners shall provide documentation showing that each communications tower is in compliance with all federal requirements. Evidence of compliance must be submitted every 12 months. 
                  (3)  Security. Communications towers shall be enclosed by decay-resistant security fencing not less than six feet in height and shall be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device; provided, however, the building and code manager or the governing body may waive such requirements for alternative tower structures. 
                  (4)  Lighting. No illumination is permitted on an antenna or tower unless required by the FCC, FAA or other state or federal agency of competent jurisdiction in which case the building and code manager may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding uses and views. 
                  (5)  Advertising. No advertising is permitted on an antenna or tower. 
                  (6)  Visual impact. 
                  a.  Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA or other applicable federal or state agency, be painted a neutral color, so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness. 
                  b.  At a tower site the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and built environment. 
                  c.  If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible. 
                  d.  Towers clustered at the same site shall be of similar height and design. 
                  e.  Towers shall be the minimum height necessary to provide parity with existing similar tower supported antenna, and shall be freestanding where the negative visual effect is less than would be created by use of a guyed tower. 
                  (7)  Landscaping. Landscaping shall be used to effectively screen the view of the tower compound from adjacent public ways, public property and residential property and shall be as follows: 
                  a.  For towers 150 feet tall or less, a buffer area no less than six feet wide shall commence at the property line. 
                  b.  For towers more than 150 feet tall, a buffer area not less than ten feet wide shall be provided at the property line. 
                  c.  The buffer zone is to consist of materials of a variety which can be expected to grow to form a continuous hedge at least five feet in height within two years of planting. 
                  d.  Trees and shrubs in the vicinity of guy wires shall be of a kind that would not exceed 20 feet in height or would not affect the stability of the guys, should they be uprooted, and shall not obscure visibility of the anchor from the transmission building or security facilities and staff/maintenance. 
                  e.  Native vegetation on the site shall be preserved to the greatest practical extent. The applicant shall provide a site plan showing existing significant vegetation to be removed, and vegetation to be replanted to replace that lost. 
                  f.  In lieu of these standards, the building and code manager may allow use of an alternate detailed plan and specifications for landscape and screening, including plantings, fences, walls and other features designed to screen and buffer towers and accessory uses. The plan shall accomplish the same degree of screening achieved by the provisions of this subsection (7), except as lesser requirements are desirable for adequate visibility for security purposes and/or for continued operation of existing bona fide agricultural or forest uses such as farms, nurseries and tree farms. In certain locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, such as remote agricultural or rural locations or developed heavy industrial areas, the landscaping requirement may be reduced or waived by the building and code manager. 
                  (8)  Maintenance impacts. Equipment at a transmission facility shall be automated to the greatest extent possible to reduce traffic and congestion. Where the site abuts or has access to a collector and local street, access for maintenance vehicles shall be exclusively by means of the collector street. A minimum of two parking spaces shall be provided on each site; an additional parking space for each two employees shall be provided at facilities which require on-site personnel. 
                  (9)  Principal, accessory and joint uses. 
                  a.  Accessory structures used in direct support of a tower shall be allowed but not be used for offices, vehicle storage or other outdoor storage. Mobile or immobile equipment not used in direct support of a tower facility shall not be stored or parked on the site of the tower, unless repairs to the tower are being made. 
                  b.  Towers may be located on-sites containing another principal use in the same buildable area. As long as all of the other siting, setback, separation and general requirements of this article are met, towers may occupy a parcel meeting the minimum lot size requirements for the zoning district in which it is located. The minimum distance between a tower and other principal use located on the same lot shall be for a monopole or lattice tower the greater of 20 percent of the tower height or 25 feet and for a guy tower the greater of 100 percent breakpoint or 25 feet. This separation is required to assure compatibility of land uses and to provide for the health, safety and welfare of individuals and structures occupying the same site. 
                  c.  Joint use of a site is prohibited when a proposed or existing principal use includes the storage, distribution or sale of volatile, flammable, explosive or hazardous materials such as propane, gasoline, natural gas and dangerous chemicals. 
                  (10)  Tower lot size, setbacks and separations. 
                  a.  The site shall be of a size and shape sufficient to provide an adequate setback from the base of the tower to any property line abutting a residential district, public property, or public street. Such setback shall be sufficient to: 
                  1.  Provide for an adequate vegetative, topographic or other buffer as required in subsections (6) and (7) of this section; 
                  2.  Preserve the privacy of surrounding residential property; 
                  3.  Protect adjoining property from the potential impact of tower failure by being large enough to accommodate such failure on the site, based on the engineer's analysis required in section 103-216. 
                  b.  A site is presumed to be of sufficient size when it: 
                  1.  Meets the requirements of subsection (10)a of this section; 
                  2.  Provides a setback equal to two times the height of the tower to any property line abutting a residential district, public property, or public street; and 
                  3.  Provides a setback equal to or exceeding the rear yard setback required for the adjoining property where the adjoining property is not in a residential district nor a public property or a public street. 
                  c.  Placement of more than one tower on a lot shall be permitted, provided all setback, design and landscape requirements are met as to each tower. Structures may be located as close to each other as technically feasible, provided tower failure characteristics of the towers on the site will not lead to multiple failures in the event that one fails. 
                  d.  For a guyed structure, the site shall be of a size and shape sufficient to provide a setback equal to at least the height of the tower from a guy anchor to any property line abutting a residential district, public property or public street in addition to the size required to comply with subsection (2) of this section. Such setback shall be adequate to provide a vegetative, topographic or other buffer sufficient to obscure view to the anchor from such adjoining properties. 
                  e.  All structures and uses associated with the transmission use other than the transmission tower shall be located to meet the setbacks required in the zoning district where the tower is to be located. To encourage and accommodate shared use of a tower, the director may waive or reduce setback requirements by up to 50 percent to accommodate the placement of additional buildings or other supporting equipment at a tower site. 
                  f.  No freestanding communications tower shall be allowed within a 1,000-foot radius of an existing tower within a residential area. 
                  g.  In no case shall a tower be located in the required front yard of a residential district. 
                  h.  All freestanding towers constructed after January 6, 1997, shall conform to the following minimum tower separation requirements: 

                   
                  Towers and antennae mounted on rooftops or alternative tower structures shall be exempt from these minimum separation distances.

                  Sec. 103-214. - Shared use. 
                  All new towers shall be designed to structurally accommodate the maximum number of additional users technically practicable. 
                  (1)  Once a new tower is approved, additional antennae and accompanying accessory uses may be added to it in accordance with the approved share plan if the building and code manager finds that the standards of this article are met. 
                  (2)  To encourage shared use of towers, no building permit or special use permit shall be required for the addition of antennae to an existing tower so long as the height of the tower or structure on which the antenna is placed is not increased and the requirements of sections 103-212(2) and 103-213 are met. 
                  (3)  If a new tower is approved, the owner shall be required as conditions of approval, to: 
                  a.  Record the letter of intent required by section 103-216(10) in miscellaneous deed records of the office of the county clerk of superior court where the tower site is located; 
                  b.  Respond in a timely, comprehensive manner to a request for information from a potential shared use applicant; 
                  c.  Negotiate in good faith for shared use by third parties; and 
                  d.  Allow shared use where the third party seeking such use agrees in writing to pay reasonable, pro rata charges for sharing, including all charges necessary to modify the tower and transmitters to accommodate shared use, but not total tower reconstruction, and to observe whatever technical requirements are necessary to allow shared use without creating interference. 
                  (4)  Willful, knowing failure of an owner whose tower was approved after the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived to comply with the requirements of subsections (3)a through d of this section shall be grounds for withholding approval of any application by such owner for a building permit or special use permit for any tower or antenna. 
                  (5)  Such conditions shall run with the land and be binding on subsequent purchasers of the tower site.

                  Sec. 103-215. - Special use permits. 
                  (a)  A request for a special use permit shall be initiated by application to the building and code manager and handled in accordance with the special use permit provisions of this Code. The city commission may issue a special use permit under this section provided it shall have determined that all of the general requirements of section 103-213 have been satisfied and, further, that the benefits of and need for the proposed tower are greater than any possible depreciating effects and damage to the neighboring properties. 
                  (b)  In granting a special use permit, the city commission may impose additional zoning conditions to the extent determined necessary to buffer or otherwise minimize adverse effects of the proposed tower or antenna on surrounding properties.

                  Sec. 103-216. - Application procedures. 
                  Application for a building permit for any communications tower or use of an alternative tower structure shall be made to the building and code manager. An application will not be considered until it is complete. A complete application must contain the following: 
                  (1)  Inventory of existing sites. An inventory of the applicant's existing towers that are either within the jurisdiction of the governing authority or within one mile of the border thereof, including specific information about the location, height, and design of each tower. The building and code manager may share such information with other applicants applying for administrative approvals or special use permits under this article or other organizations seeking to locate antennae within the jurisdiction of the governing authority; provided, however, that the building and code manager is not, by sharing such information, in any way representing or warranting that such sites are available or suitable. 
                  (2)  Site plan to scale specifying the location of tower, guy anchors (if any), transmission building and/or other accessory uses, access, parking, fences, landscaped areas, and adjacent land uses. 
                  (3)  Landscape plan to scale indicating size, spacing and type of plantings required in section 103-213(7). 
                  (4)  Utilities inventory showing the locations of all water, sewage, drainage and power lines impacting the proposed tower site. 
                  (5)  An environmental impact statement fully describing the effects that the proposed tower and/or antenna will have on the environment and surrounding area including the radiological impact on human health, impacts on adjacent residential structures and districts, impacts on structures and sites of historic significance and impacts on streetscapes. 
                  (6)  A certified statement prepared by an engineer licensed to practice in the state that the construction of the tower, including reception and transmission functions, will not interfere with the usual and customary transmission or reception of radio, television, etc., service enjoyed by adjacent properties. 
                  (7)  A description of anticipated maintenance needs, including frequency of service, personnel needs, equipment needs, and traffic, noise or safety impacts of such maintenance. 
                  (8)  Report from a professional structural engineer licensed in the state, documenting the following: 
                  a.  Tower height and design, including technical, engineering, economic, and other pertinent factors governing selection of the proposed design. A cross section of the tower structure shall be included. 
                  b.  Total anticipated capacity of the structure, including number and types of antennae which can be accommodated. 
                  c.  Evidence of structural integrity of the tower structure. 
                  d.  Failure characteristics of the tower and demonstration that site and setbacks are of adequate size to contain debris. 
                  (9)  Written statements from the FAA, FCC and any appropriate state review authority stating that the proposed tower complies with regulations administered by that agency or that the tower is exempt from those regulations. 
                  (10)  Letter of intent to lease excess space on the tower structure and to lease additional excess land on the tower site when the shared use potential of the tower is absorbed, if structurally and technically possible. 
                  (11)  A reasonable pro rata charge may be made for shared use, consistent with an appropriate sharing of construction, financing and maintenance costs. Fees may also be charged for any structural or RF changes necessitated by such shared use. Such sharing shall be a condition of approval if approval is granted. 
                  a.  The applicant shall describe what range of charges are reasonably expected to be assessed against shared users. 
                  b.  The applicant shall base charges on generally accepted accounting principles and shall explain the elements included in the charge. 
                  (12)  The applicant shall quantify the additional tower capacity anticipated, including the approximate number and types of antennae. The applicant shall also describe any limitations on the ability of the tower to accommodate other uses (e.g., radio frequency interference, mass height, frequency or other characteristics). The applicant shall describe the technical options available to overcome those limitations and reasons why the technical options considered were not chosen to be incorporated. The building and code manager shall approve those limitations if they cannot be overcome by reasonable technical means. 
                  (13)  Evidence of the lack of space on all suitable existing towers to locate the proposed antenna and of the lack of space on existing tower sites to construct a tower for the proposed antenna. 
                  (14)  Each applicant must make a good faith effort to substantially demonstrate that no existing or planned towers can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna/transmitter as described below. 
                  a.  The applicant shall contact the owners of all existing or planned towers of a height roughly equal to or greater than the height of the tower proposed by the applicant. A list shall be provided of all owners contacted, the date of such contact, and the form and content of such contact. 
                  b.  Such contact shall be made in a timely manner; that is, sufficiently before the filing of an application for a building or special use permit to include a response into the application when filed. 
                  1.  Failure of a listed owner to respond shall not be relevant if a timely, good faith effort was made to obtain one. However, where an existing or planned tower is known to have capacity for additional antennae of the sort proposed, based on the decision regarding such tower, that application for a new tower shall not be complete until the owner of the existing or planned tower responds. Such response is to be required as a condition of approval. 
                  2.  The building and code manager shall maintain and provide, on request, records of responses from each owner. 
                  3.  Once an owner demonstrates an antenna of the sort proposed by the applicant cannot be accommodated on the owner's tower as described below, the owner need not be contacted by future applicants for antennae of the sort proposed. 
                  c.  The applicant shall request the following information from each owner contacted: 
                  1.  Identification of the site by location, tax lot number, existing uses, and tower height. 
                  2.  Whether each such tower could structurally accommodate the antenna proposed by the applicant without requiring structural changes be made to the tower. To enable the owner to respond, the applicant shall provide each such owner with the height, length, weight, and other relevant data about the proposed antenna. 
                  3.  Whether each such tower could structurally accommodate the proposed antenna if structural changes were made, not including totally rebuilding the tower. If so, the owner shall specify in general terms what structural changes would be required. 
                  4.  If structurally able, would shared use by such existing tower be precluded for reasons related to RF interference. If so, the owner shall describe in general terms what changes in either the existing or proposed antenna would be required to accommodate the proposed tower, if at all. 
                  5.  If shared use is possible, the fee an owner of an existing tower to charge for such shared use. 
                  d.  Shared use is not precluded simply because a reasonable fee for shared use is charged, or because of reasonable costs necessary to adapt the existing and proposed uses to a shared tower. The building and code manager and the governing body may consider expert testimony to determine whether the fee and costs are reasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development are presumed unreasonable. 
                  (15)  Any other information which may be requested by the building and code manager to fully evaluate and review the application and the potential impact of a proposed tower and/or antenna.

                  All towers and antennae shall be maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable building and technical codes so as to ensure the structural integrity of such towers. If upon inspection by the building and code manager such tower is determined not to comply with the code standards or to constitute a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to the owner of the tower and the owner of the property if such owner is different, such owners shall have 30 days to bring such tower into compliance. In the event such tower or antenna is not brought into compliance within 30 days, the city may provide notice to the owners requiring the tower or antenna to be removed. In the event such tower or antenna is not removed within 30 days of receipt of such notice, the city may remove such tower or antenna and place a lien upon the property for the costs of removal. Delay by the city in taking action shall not in any way waive the city's right to take action. The city may pursue all legal remedies available to it to ensure that communications towers and antenna not in compliance with the code standards or which constitute a danger to persons or property are brought into compliance or removed. The city may seek to have the tower or antenna removed regardless of the owners' or operator's intent to operate the tower or antenna and regardless of any permits, federal, state or otherwise, which may have been granted.

                  (a)  Any antenna or tower that is not operated for a continuous period of 12 months shall be considered abandoned, whether or not the owner or operator intends to make use of the tower. The owner of an abandoned antenna or tower and the owner of the property where the tower is located shall be under a duty to remove such a tower or antenna. If such antenna and/or tower is not removed within 60 days of receipt of notice from the city notifying the owner of such abandonment, the city may remove such tower and/or antenna and place a lien upon the property for the costs of removal. The city may pursue all legal remedies available to it to insure that abandoned communications towers and antenna are removed. Delay by the city in taking action shall not in any way waive the city's right to take action. The city may seek to have the communications tower or antenna removed regardless of the owners' or operator's intent to operate the tower or antenna and regardless of any permits, federal, state or otherwise, which may have been granted. 
                  (b)  If the owner of an abandoned tower or antenna wishes to use such abandoned tower or antenna, the owner first must apply for and receive all applicable permits and meet all of the conditions of this article as if such tower or antenna were a new tower or antenna.

                  Sec. 105-20. - Introduction and statement of policy. 
                  (a)  Most types of urban development involve the construction of buildings and paved surfaces which lead to an increase in stormwater runoff. In order to minimize the impact from stormwater runoff caused by development, the city adopted the ordinance from which this article is derived in 2000. This article will require that new developments provide stormwater detention systems to control stormwater so that the rate of stormwater runoff is not increased. In other words, postdevelopment stormwater runoff rates should not exceed predevelopment stormwater runoff rates. 
                  (b)  In order to provide an orderly and progressive improvement to the city storm drainage problems, the city is adopting a policy for controlling the stormwater runoff caused by development. 
                  (c)  With the adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived, it becomes the policy of the city to: 
                  (1)  Require storm detention facilities for most types of new development; and 
                  (2)  Require that the peak release rate of stormwater runoff from all developments, where stormwater detention is required, not exceed the peak release rate from the development site in its natural undeveloped state. 
                  (Code 1977, § 9½-1; Ord. No. 00-09, § 1.1, 5-2-2000) 
                  Sec. 105-21. - Purposes. 
                  The purposes of this article are as follows: 
                  (1)  To recognize that the city is continually undergoing topographical changes due to development and redevelopment activities consisting of new construction or additions to existing facilities. These changes result in additional stormwater runoff due to land area being paved, roofed, or otherwise made impervious. 
                  (2)  To recognize that development or redevelopment which caused stormwater runoff not only compounds existing drainage problems but also creates new problems, and that the resolution of these problems will require the joint efforts or the city, developers, and property owners. 
                  (3)  To recognize the necessity of establishing guidelines, design requirements, rules and regulations, etc., for the resolution of these problems by formulating and adopting the storm drainage regulations contained in this article. 
                  (4)  To assure the city's continued eligibility under the National Flood Insurance Program, by instituting effective drainage controls. 
                  (5)  To provide developers and property owners with general information as to minimum stormwater runoff requirements that will be necessary for new developments or additions to existing facilities. 
                  (6)  To provide design engineers with general basic design formulas and data for their use and as guidelines in designing storm drainage systems. 
                  (7)  To reduce soil erosion and sedimentation in creeks, streams, ditches, etc., by incorporating effective soil erosion and sedimentation plans into the storm drainage plans.

                  b.  If the owner-developer fails to comply within the stated time, he will be deemed in violation of this article. 
                  (4)  Enforcement. The city engineer, or his designee, may, upon any owner/developer being deemed in violation, cause a citation to be issued to said person for his appearance in the municipal court. Said citation shall state nature of violation and time and date that he must appear. Such person will be subject to punishment as set forth in section 1-9. 
                  (5)  Appeals. In the event the owner/developer and the city engineer cannot reach a satisfactory resolution to disputed points within the drainage plans, the plans shall be deemed disapproved by the city engineer. The city engineer shall immediately notify the owner/developer of such disapproval. The owner/developer shall have ten days from the city engineer's disapproval of such disapproval to file an appeal to be submitted to the city manager. If such action is not taken within a ten-day period, the owner/developer shall forfeit the right to appeal as provided in this article and the plans will be deemed disapproved until plans have been revised and resubmitted to the city engineer for a review. 
                  a.  Step 1. 
                  1.  Appeals submitted to the city manager shall be written for presentation which supports the owner/developer's position as to why certain regulations should be waived or modified, or other reason why the owner/developer disagrees with the decision of the city engineer disapproving said plans. 
                  2.  Upon receipt of the appeal, the city manager will review and meet with both the city engineer and the owner/developer and hear both sides. Following the presentation, the city manager will render a decision within 15 days. 
                  b.  Step 2. 
                  1.  Following receipt of the city manager's opinion, the owner/developer has 15 days to appeal the city manager's decision to the city commission. The notice of appeal shall be filed with the city clerk. 
                  2.  The appeal to the city commission shall be on the evidentiary record as developed before the appeal to the city commission. The city commission shall not hear or allow additional evidence. The owner/developer and the city manager may submit a written argument or brief and may request oral argument. The decision to grant or deny oral argument shall be at the discretion of the city commission. 
                  The city commission shall review the record and evidence at either a special called meeting or a regularly scheduled meeting within 20 days of the filing of the notice of appeal. The city commission shall render a decision within a reasonable period of time thereafter. The decision of the city commission shall be the final decision of the city.

                  Sec. 105-23. - Drainage requirements. 
                  (a)  Unless exempt from the requirements of this article, all new developments or additions to existing developments shall provide a combination of on-site storage (detention facility) and controlled release of stormwater runoff. On-site storage shall be provided for the stormwater runoff generated by the two-year, five-year, ten-year, 25-year, 50-year and 100-year 24-hour storm events. 
                  (b)  The peak release rate of stormwater runoff from all developments where detention is required shall not exceed the peak stormwater runoff rate from the development site in its natural undeveloped state for all storm intensities listed in subsection (a) of this section. The runoff coefficient for a development site in its natural undeveloped state shall correspond to the runoff coefficient for woodlands land use for the natural slope and soil present on the property, but in no case shall it exceed 0.30 without the concurrence of the city engineer. 
                  (c)  The developer shall submit a drainage study, prepared and certified by a professional engineer, registered to practice in the state, and shall include plans, computations, and other information as required in section 105-24. 
                  (d)  Developments having exemptions or special conditions are as follows: 
                  (1)  Single-family residential lots presently undeveloped. These lots, if used for one single-family residential structure, will be exempt from complying with the requirements of this article. 
                  (2)  Any development or addition to an existing development that has a total site size of two acres or less and does not increase the total runoff from the post-developed site by more than ten percent of the total runoff from the pre-developed site for the 24-year, 24-hour frequency storm event. 
                  (3)  Developments having special conditions shall comply with the following: Any development consisting of, but not limited to, additions to existing structures, new separate structures, paving, filling, excavating, grading, etc., in floodplains, are to be discouraged. Should an owner or developer, however, consider development of such sites he will be required, in addition to this article, to comply with the National Flood Insurance Program regulations. The city has on file in the offices of the city engineer a flood hazard boundary map, latest revision furnished by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Federal Insurance Administration. This map shows the sections of creeks within the city which are included in the National Flood Insurance Program. 
                  (e)  The drainage study shall show what effects the developments will have both upstream and downstream. Should the study reveal that the developments will increase the flow or flood stages downstream or increases the flood stages upstream, no developments will be approved unless equivalent flow and storage capabilities are replaced and maintained by the owner or developer on his property. 
                  (f)  The lowest finished floor level, shall be set at least two feet above the 100-year flood level. Parking lots, carports, garages, and driveways shall have the lowest elevation set a minimum of one foot above the 100-year flood level. Floodproofing of residential and nonresidential structures is acceptable under certain conditions, as may be determined by the city engineer. 
                  (Code 1977, § 9½-4; Ord. No. 00-09, § 1.4, 5-2-2000; Ord. No. 00-17, § 1, 7-18-2000)

                  (1)  Runoff. The peak rates of runoff shall be computed by the rational method, SCS or other acceptable methods. 
                  (2)  Rainfall intensity. Rainfall intensity-duration curves, for the City of Savannah as found in the Georgia Manual on Drainage Design for Highways, Georgia Department of Transportation, (Manual) latest edition, or locally developed intensity curves derived using standardly acceptable engineering methods, shall be used for determining rainfall intensity for the various return frequencies. Said manual is incorporated herein by reference. 
                  (3)  Pipe selection. Manning's Formula shall be used to select size of pipe and slopes (grade). 
                  (4)  Detention facility design. The reservoir routing method of design shall be used for determining the required storage volume and design of the outlet control structure of the detention facility. The peak stormwater runoff release rate for the proposed development shall not exceed the peak stormwater runoff rate from the development site in its natural undeveloped state for all storm intensities from the two-year storm up to and including the 100-year storm. The runoff coefficient for a development site in its natural undeveloped stage shall correspond to the run-off coefficient for woodlands land use for the natural slope and soil present on the property, but in no case shall it exceed 0.30. Detention facility outlet control structures and other drainage improvements shall be located and designed to prevent erosion damage to adjacent property owners. 
                  (5)  Connection to existing storm drains. The drainage study shall show what effect development will have on existing drainage facilities when connection is being proposed. If discharge is not made to an existing facility then study shall show what the effect will be on the first drainage facility (pipe, culvert, etc.) downstream from the point of discharge. 
                  (6)  Plans. Drainage study shall include a site plan showing the drainage facilities and the following general information:

As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
                  (2)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This subsection shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such failure occurs.

                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this subsection, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills. 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property. 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners. 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum. 
                  (14)  Land disturbing activity plans for erosion and sedimentation control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection (b)(2) of this section. 
                  (15)  Except as provided in subsection (c)(16) of this section, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the groundwater table year-round; for which groundwater is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-20 et seq., the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this subsection. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the streambed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the streambed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
                  1.  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
                  2.  Stream crossings for sewer lines. 
                  (16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-20 et seq., of the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.  No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the streambed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the streambed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
                  1.  Stream crossings for water lines; or

                  (d)  The fact that land disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
                  (Code 1977, § 32½-4; Ord. No. 96-19, § 2, 7-9-1996; Ord. No. 04-22, § A, 11-15-2004; Ord. No. 12-11, § A, 9-4-2012; Ord. No. 12-12, § A, 10-2-2012) 
                  Sec. 105-58. - Application/permit process. 
                  (a)  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the stormwater management provisions of article II of this chapter, soil erosion and sedimentation control provisions of this article, subdivision regulations contained in chapter 113, the flood damage prevention ordinance, the zoning ordinance, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
                  (b)  Application requirements. 
                  (1)  No person shall conduct any land disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the city without first obtaining a permit from the city engineer's office to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
                  (2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the city engineer's office and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection (c) of this section. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of section 105-57(b) and (c) will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by three copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
                  (3)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a), half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  (4)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by section 105-57(c)(15) and (16) has been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per subsection (b)(6) of this section, have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
                  (5)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
                  (6)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  (c)  Plan requirements. 
                  (1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in section 105-57(b) and (c), or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" is hereby incorporated by reference into this article. The plan for the land disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and stormwater management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
                  (2)  Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land disturbing activity was permitted. 
                  (d)  Permits. 
                  (1)  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
                  (2)  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this article, any variances required by section 105-57(c)(15) and (16) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per subsection (b)(6) of this section are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
                  (3)  Any land disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this article, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
                  (4)  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
                  (5)  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this article. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
                  (6)  The LIA may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(f)(1).

                  (a)  Failure to obtain a permit for land disturbing activity. If any person commences any land disturbing activity requiring a land disturbing permit as prescribed in this article without first obtaining said permit, the person shall be subject to revocation of his business license, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a business and associated work activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. 
                  (b)  Stop work orders. 
                  (1)  For the first and second violations of the provisions of this article, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have five days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within five days, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a stop work order requiring that land disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided, however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop work order in lieu of a warning. 
                  (2)  For a third and each subsequent violation, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop work order. 
                  (3)  All stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. 
                  (4)  When a violation in the form of taking action without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer, or significant amounts of sediment, as determined by the local issuing authority or by the director or his designee, have been or are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained, a stop work order shall be issued by the local issuing authority or by the director or his designee. All such stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop work orders shall apply to all land disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls. 
                  (c)  Bond forfeiture. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land disturbing activities has failed to comply with the approved plan, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person.

If the person engaged in the land disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to have forfeited his performance bond, if required to post one under the provisions of section 105-58(b)(6). The local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. 
                  (d)  Monetary penalties. Any person who violates any provisions of this article, or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant to this article, or who negligently or intentionally fails or refuses to comply with any final or emergency order of the director issued as provided in this article shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 per day. For the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this article, notwithstanding any provisions in the city Charter to the contrary, municipal courts shall be authorized to impose penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Each day during which violation or failure or refusal to comply continues shall be a separate violation.

                  (a)  Approval of material change in appearance in historic districts or involving historic properties. After the designation by ordinance of a historic property or of a historic district, no material change in the appearance of such historic property, or of a structure, site, or work of art within such historic district, shall be made or be permitted to be made by the owner or occupant thereof, unless or until the application for a certificate of appropriateness has been submitted to and approved by the preservation commission.

                  (b)  Submission of plans to commission.

The preservation commission shall hold a public hearing at which each proposed certificate of appropriateness shall be discussed. Notice of the hearing shall be published in the principal newspaper of local circulation in the city. The preservation commission shall provide written notice of the hearing by regular mail to all owners and occupants likely to be materially affected by the application. The preservation commission shall give the property owner and/or applicant an opportunity to be heard at the certificate of appropriateness hearing. 
                  (e)  The preservation commission shall approve the application and issue a certificate of appropriateness if it finds that the proposed material change in appearance would not have a substantial adverse effect on the esthetic, historical, or architectural significance and value of the historic property or the historic district. In making this determination, the preservation commission shall consider, in addition to any other pertinent factors: 
                  (1)  The historical and architectural value and significance; architectural style; 
                  (2)  General design, arrangement, texture, and material of the architectural features involved; and

The preservation commission may suggest alternative courses of action it thinks proper if it disapproves of the application submitted. The applicant, if he so desires, may make modifications to the plans and may resubmit the application at any time after doing so. 
                  (i)  In cases where the application covers a material change in the appearance of a structure which would require the issuance of a building permit, the rejection of an application for a certificate of appropriateness by the preservation commission shall be binding upon the building inspector or other administrative officer charged with issuing building permits; and, in such a case, no building permit shall be issued. 
                  (j)  Where such action is authorized by the city commission and is reasonably necessary or appropriate for the preservation of a unique historic property, the preservation commission may enter into negotiations with the owner for the acquisition by gift, purchase, exchange, or otherwise of the property or any interest therein. 
                  (k)  Where, by reason of unusual circumstances, the strict application of any provision of this chapter would result in exceptional practical difficulty or undue hardship upon any owner of any specific property, the preservation commission, in passing upon applications, shall have the power to vary or modify strict adherence to the provisions or to interpret the meaning of the provision so as to relieve such difficulty or hardship; provided, however, that such variance, modification, or interpretation shall remain in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the provisions so that the architectural or historical integrity or character of the property shall be conserved and substantial justice done. In granting variations, the preservation commission may impose such reasonable and additional stipulations and conditions as will in its judgment best fulfill the purpose of this chapter. 
                  (l)  The preservation commission shall keep a record of all applications for certificates of appropriateness and of all its proceedings.

Any such appeal must be filed with the clerk of the city commission within 15 days after the issuance of the determination or, in the case of a failure of the preservation commission to act within 15 days of the expiration of the 45-day period allowed for the preservation commission action. Appeals from decisions of the city commission made pursuant to this chapter may be taken to the superior court in the manner provided by law for appeals from a conviction for municipal or county ordinance violations. 
                  (n)  A certificate of appropriateness is not required if the only work to be done is routine or general maintenance as defined in the preservation commission's design guidelines.

                  The subdivider shall be assessed a fee as established by the city commission plus an additional amount per residential lot or other parcel payable to the secretary of the planning commission, to help defray the cost to the agencies of local government in reviewing preliminary and final plats and in inspecting the installation of improvements. Such fee must be tendered prior to application for preliminary plat approval. Payment of such fee does not relieve the subdivider of the full responsibility for providing supervision for the installation of improvements nor limit his responsibility for full compliance with the provisions of this chapter.

                  The secretary of the planning commission shall remit fees collected under section 113-27 to the city at such time and in such manner as may be prescribed by the chief administrator of the city. The city shall receive the entire filing and inspection fee where the subdivision lies wholly within the city limits. Where the city limits passes through a residential subdivision, the fee shall be apportioned to the city and county in direct proportion to the number of residential lots or portions thereof lying within the respective jurisdiction, each portion of a lot to be counted as a whole lot and to be counted only for that jurisdiction within which one-half or more (in area) of it lies. In the case of a group housing development, a shopping center, or any other subdivision not having normal size residential lots and through which city limits passes, the fee to the city and to county shall be in direct proportion to the gross acreage lying within the respective jurisdiction.

                  (1)  There are special circumstances or conditions affecting the property; 
                  (2)  The literal interpretation of this chapter would make impossible a reasonable and acceptable development of the property in question and thus cause unusual and unnecessary hardship to the subdivider; and 
                  (3)  The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public welfare and not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of this chapter. 
                  (b)  In granting a variance, the planning commission may require compliance with such conditions as necessary to secure conformity with subsection (a)(3) of this section. The variance, with any conditions upon it is contingent and with the reasons upon which it is based, shall be recorded in the minutes of the planning commission.

The clerk of the appropriate superior court shall not file or record a plat of a subdivision which does not have the written approval of the planning commission thereon. Any person who files or records a plat of subdivision without such approval is guilty of violating this chapter and upon conviction before the municipal court shall be punished as provided by section 1-9, provided that the subdivider shall bear entirely the guilt should he represent the plat as approved by the planning commission when such is not the case.

                  Sec. 113-108. - Preapplication procedure. 
                  (a)  Prior to the filing of application for approval of the preliminary plat, the subdivider should consult informally with the planning commission's staff in order to be fully advised of the objectives of the regulations and his obligations under them and to receive assistance in planning his subdivision. If the proposed subdivision is to involve individual sewage systems, the subdivider should also consult informally with the county health department. The object of such consultation is to fully explain to the subdivider the procedures for obtaining approval of his plat and the requirements upon which approval is contingent, in order that he might be spared needless expenditures in connection with an unacceptable plat. 
                  (b)  After the initial consultation described in subsection (a) of this section, two copies of the plans and data specified in section 113-109 shall be submitted to the planning commission as part of the preapplication procedure. This step does not require formal application, fee, or filing of a plat. 
                  (c)  The planning commission shall determine the plat location of any public sites or open spaces, or of any rights-of-way for connectors, arterials, or controlled access thoroughfares, for which it shall require reservation or dedication under section 113-145 or 113-140(j), respectively. 
                  (d)  Within 20 days after receipt of all the prescribed preapplication plans and data, the office of the planning commission shall inform the subdivider that the plans and data submitted (or as modified) do or do not meet the objectives of this chapter and explain any lack of conformity therewith. 
                  (Ord. of 7-7-1964, § II(A)) 
                  Sec. 113-109. - Plans and data for preapplication procedure. 
                  Preapplication review of the proposed subdivision shall be based upon the following plans and information, which shall be submitted in the form specified by the planning commission: 
                  (1)  General subdivision information which shall describe or outline the existing conditions on the site and the development proposed for the site, as necessary to supplement the drawings required in subsections (2) and (3) of this section, and which may include the following: existing restrictive deed covenants; land characteristics to include topographic suitability for building; available community facilities and utilities; a description of the subdivision proposed, to include acreage, number of residential lots, typical lot width and depth, and the extent of and justification for business areas, parks, playgrounds, and other public areas; and, statements concerning proposed protective covenants and proposed utilities and street improvements. 
                  (2)  A location map covering the tract proposed for subdivision and the surrounding area and depicting existing community facilities serving or influencing the proposed subdivision, to include the following information: location of the proposed subdivision; main traffic arteries and public transportation lines; shopping centers and such facilities as elementary and high schools, parks and playgrounds, railroad stations, airports, hospitals and churches; name of the subdivider, title, scale, north arrow and date. 
                  (3)  A sketch plan which shall show in simple sketch form the proposed layout of streets, alleys, easements, lots and other features and which shall show streets and platting in immediately surrounding areas. The sketch plan may be a free hand pencil sketch made directly on a print of the boundary survey and shall include: 
                  a.  Boundary lines, with bearings (may be magnetic) and distances along them and with reference to control points. 
                  b.  Location and width of street rights-of-way. 
                  c.  Location, width, and purpose of easements. 
                  d.  Location of structures which will remain in place, such as houses, barns, commercial buildings, railroads, towers, and retaining walls. 
                  e.  Certification of registered land surveyor, date of survey, scale of map, and north arrow. 
                  f.  Topographic contour lines at an interval of one foot for slopes of six percent or less, or, of two feet for slopes greater than six percent, where the planning commission determines that this information is necessary to determine the suitability of the proposed subdivision design and development.

                  Sec. 113-110. - Procedure for approval of preliminary plat. 
                  As the first step in the procedure for preliminary plat approval, the subdivider shall cause to be prepared a preliminary plat, together with the other material specified in section 113-111. 
                  (1)  At least 20 days prior to the meeting of the planning commission at which it is to be initially considered, six copies of the preliminary plat and any required supplementary material shall be submitted, in accordance with the provisions of section 113-111, to the office of the planning commission with a written request for approval. A receipt for the filing fee required by section 113-27 shall also be included with the preliminary plat. 
                  (2)  Copies of the preliminary plat shall be distributed by the staff of the planning commission to the county health department, the city (county) engineer, and the water department. Each of these agencies shall have ten days after receiving the preliminary plat to review it and shall communicate their findings to the planning commission. 
                  (3)  Prior to approval or disapproval of the preliminary plat, the planning commission shall afford a hearing to the person of name and address designated on the plat to receive notice of such hearing and shall give notice of the hearing by registered mail to said address at least five days before the date fixed therefor, stating date, place, and time of such hearing. 
                  (4)  The planning commission shall determine the plat location of any public sites or open spaces, or of any rights-of-way for connectors, arterials, or controlled access thoroughfares for which it shall require reservation or dedication, where this has not been done in the preapplication procedure. 
                  (5)  Within 30 days of receipt of the preliminary plat with application for approval, the planning commission shall notify the city (county) of any streets and public sites or open spaces and the city (county) board of education of any school sites which the subdivider will be required to reserve for purchase in accordance with sections 113-140(j) and 113-145. The city (county) or city (county) board of education shall then have 30 days within which to reach an agreement with the subdivider on the price to be paid the subdivider for such streets, public sites or open spaces upon termination of the reservation. Should the city (county) or city (county) board of education be unable to agree, within the specified time, on the price to be paid for land to be reserved, the city (county) or city (county) board of education and the subdivider shall each select an appraiser and these two appraisers shall select a third; and the three appraisers shall by majority decision arrive at a fair price for the street, public site, or open space in question, as of the time of reservation. The expense of employing the three appraisers shall be shared equally by city (county) or city (county) board of education and the subdivider. This procedure shall in no way limit the city (county) or city (county) board of education in the application of eminent domain procedure under state law, nor deny the subdivider free access to the courts. 
                  (6)  Within 30 days after submission of the preliminary plat, the planning commission shall give its approval, disapproval, or approval subject to listed modifications, in accordance with the findings of the agencies listed in subsection (2) of this section, relating to their areas of responsibility and as determined by the administrative regulations of each agency. Failure of the planning commission to act on the preliminary plat within the 30 days shall be deemed approval of it, unless the applicant for approval has waived this requirement and consented to extension of such period. 
                  (7)  The action of the planning commission shall be noted on each copy of the preliminary plat and copies returned to the subdivider, the county health department, the city (county) engineer, and the water department, with one copy retained by the planning commission. 
                  (8)  Approval of the preliminary plat shall not constitute approval of the final plat. Rather, it should be deemed an expression of approval of the layout submitted on the preliminary plat as a guide to the preparation of the final plat, the approval of which depends upon the fulfillment of the site improvement and other requirements of this chapter. 
                  (9)  The installation of site improvements is to proceed only in accordance with an approved preliminary plat and the required data submitted therewith. No street or alley grading shall be done upon land to be dedicated to the public use or which would cause a connection to be made to a public street or alley until: 
                  a.  Acceptable plans and profiles have been submitted to the city (county) engineer; and 
                  b.  A street construction permit has been issued by the city (county) engineer. 
                  (10)  Approval of the preliminary plat shall be effective for a period of one year, provided that this shall not apply to a preliminary plat of a subdivision within which improvements are to be installed in stages with a final plat for each stage. In such case, the planning commission will prepare a schedule indicating the time period allowed for the final plat of each stage, provided that the overall time limit for such a preliminary plat shall not exceed three years and may be as short as one year, at the discretion of the planning commission in consideration of the complexity of site improvement in the particular case and the number of stages involved. The planning commission may grant extensions of the time period within which the preliminary plat approval is effective, each such extension not to exceed a period of one year.

                  Sec. 113-112. - Procedure for approval of the final plat. 
                  (a)  At least 20 days prior to the meeting of the planning commission at which it is to be considered, the subdivider shall submit to the office of the planning commission an application for approval of the final plat and the plat and data required under II-F, including an original tracing of the final plat drawn on linen, or other material of equal or better durability and dimensional stability, one paper reproducible, and six copies. The final plat shall be drawn in black drawing ink on sheets dimensioned 24 inches by 36 inches and shall be drawn to a scale of one inch equals 100 feet or less number of feet in increments of ten, as may be appropriate to the size of the subdivision and plat sheet size. Where necessary, the plat may be drawn on several sheets accompanied by an index sheet showing by keyed sections the portion of the subdivision covered by each sheet. The final plat shall conform substantially to the preliminary plat as approved by the planning commission; and if desired by the subdivider, it may constitute only that portion of the preliminary plat which he proposes to record at the time, provided, however, that such a final plat conforms to the time limitations specified in subsection 113-110(10) and all other requirements of this chapter.

                  (b)  Where a street is not shown in any street or highway plan approved by the planning commission, the arrangement of streets in a subdivision shall: 
                  (1)  Be designed and located in proper relation to existing streets and shall provide, where appropriate, for the continuation or projection of existing streets; or 
                  (2)  Conform to a plan for the neighborhood approved or adopted by the planning commission to meet a particular situation where topographic or other conditions make continuance or conformance to existing streets impracticable. 
                  (c)  The arrangement of streets in a subdivision shall be so designed that adequate access is provided to adjacent unplatted areas by streets extended to the subdivision boundary where appropriate. 
                  (d)  Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed controlled access thoroughfare or arterial as shown on a street or highway plan approved by the planning commission, the planning commission may require marginal access streets, lots backing onto the thoroughfare or arterial with a nonaccess reservation along the rear property line, or such other treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection of the abutting properties and to afford separation of through and local traffic. The nonaccess reservation shall be at least 15 feet in depth in addition to the normal lot depth requirement and shall be a part of the platted lots but shall have the following restrictive covenant to be filed with the plat: 
                  "The nonaccess reservations as designated on the plat shall be reserved for the planting of trees or shrubs by the owner; the building of structures thereon is prohibited." 
                  (e)  Where a subdivision abuts or contains a railroad right-of-way, the planning commission may require a street approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way, at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening land, provided that where such street intersects a controlled access thoroughfare or arterial, the minimum distance from said railroad right-of-way shall not be less than 250 feet.

Rights-of-way for the turnarounds for such streets may be the same as roadway dimensions, with appropriate provision for reversion to adjoining property owners of any turn-around right-of-way in excess of required street right-of-way width upon extension of the street. 
                  (q)  Streets which are obviously in alignment with others already existing and named in the city's urban area shall bear the names of existing streets, and in no case shall the names of proposed streets which are not in alignment with named existing streets duplicate the names of existing streets, irrespective of the suffix, avenue, drive, court, road, street, etc. Street names shall be subject to the approval of the planning commission.

                  Sec. 113-145. - Public sites and open spaces. 
                  (a)  Where features of the comprehensive plan, such as school sites, parks, playgrounds or sites for other public building and open spaces, as approved by the city or county board of education, are located in whole or in part within a proposed subdivision, any portion of which lies within the city, the planning commission shall determine on the preapplication plan or the preliminary plat of the subdivision (according to the procedure being followed) the boundaries of the portions of such features included within the subdivision and shall provide for the acquisition of such public sites and open spaces according to the following provisions: 
                  (1)  Where acquisition upon the approval of the final plat is possible, this is the recommended procedure. 
                  (2)  Where acquisition is not immediately possible, the public sites and open spaces shall be reserved for a period of five years from the date of final plat approval, within which time the city or county board of education may purchase the public site or open space from the subdivider at the price previously agreed upon by the procedure specified in section 113-110(5). The subdivider shall be paid interest at the rate of six percent per annum on the amount as determined by section 113-110(5) for the sites being reserved, such interest to run for the period of time between approval of the final plat by the planning commission and termination of reservation. The reserved site should be platted in lots as part of the overall subdivision, so that in case it is not acquired, it can be efficiently used for building lots. 
                  (b)  In case there is a need for public sites or open spaces not designated on the comprehensive plan, but which are considered essential by the planning commission, the planning commission shall attempt to arrange voluntary reservation of such sites with the subdivider. The time period of reservation would, in such a case, be determined by negotiation, and although the city (county) or city (county) board of education would be under no obligation to purchase, a price to be applied in the event of purchase shall be agreed upon within 60 days of application for preliminary plat approval. The reserved site should be platted in lots as part of the overall subdivision, so that in case it is not acquired, it can be efficiently used for building lots. 
                  (c)  Due regard shall be shown to the preservation of all natural features, such as large trees, historical spots, lakes and ponds, and similar community assets, which if properly included in the overall design of the subdivision, will add attractiveness and value to the property.

                  Sec. 113-147. - Mobile home parks and mobile home subdivisions. 
                  The requirements of this chapter with respect to lot, block, and street design shall apply to mobile home parks and mobile home subdivisions with the following exceptions: 
                  (1)  Streets. 
                  a.  The internal streets serving the mobile homes and complementary facilities shall have a right-of-way width of 50 feet. 
                  b.  A gridiron-type street system will not be acceptable, nor any other type of site planning which would result in a monotonous, unattractive development. 
                  c.  The park or subdivision shall abut for a distance of at least 200 feet any street upon which there are ingress and egress points. 
                  d.  Privately-owned streets shall service all lots and parcels within a mobile home park, but shall meet the improvement standards specified in article V of this chapter. Private streets shall not be permitted within a mobile home subdivision. 
                  e.  A deflection in the alignment of a service street shall be connected by a curve having minimum centerline radius of not less than 80 feet. 
                  f.  The requirement for a 100-foot tangent between reverse curves is not applicable. 
                  g.  Dead-end streets shall have an 80-foot-diameter turnaround, but the right-of-way may be the same dimension. 
                  h.  The street system within a mobile home park shall provide direct access to areas to be occupied by transient mobile homes, so that it is not necessary to pass through areas of nontransient homes in order to reach them. 
                  (2)  Easements. Utility easements (section 113-141(a)) shall not be required in a mobile home park but shall be required in a mobile home subdivision.

Recreation areas provided for the common use of residents of the mobile home park or subdivision shall be permitted to reduce the minimum area of the mobile home lot by an area equal to the total area of the recreation areas divided by the total number of lots in the park or subdivision, such reduction not to exceed 300 square feet. 
                  b.  Each park or subdivision shall have not less than 25 mobile home lots. 
                  c.  Mobile home lots shall be so proportioned as to provide space for a mobile home stand of ten feet by 50 feet, a patio of 180 square feet, and a driveway and one automobile parking space, and shall meet any yard and open space requirements of the zoning regulations pertaining to mobile homes. 
                  d.  Parcels to be provided for commercial and service facilities shall be of size and design necessary to serve only the particular park or subdivision. 
                  e.  Minimum length of lot abutment on a public street (section 113-143(b)) shall not be required.

                  Subdivision I. - In General 

                  Sec. 113-178. - Purpose. 
                  Consistent with the overarching goals of this chapter, this division is intended to allow for private street and/or gated developments as one type of residential development alternative to allow the city to expand housing types and promote smart residential subdivision growth within the city. 
                  (Ord. No. 08-01, § I(A), 1-15-2008) 
                  Sec. 113-179. - Jurisdiction. 
                  The provisions of this division shall apply to the city, including, without limitation, portions of the city which lie in Pierce County, Georgia, and any portions which may be annexed hereafter, and further includes property which may lie in any other county of the state which is subsequently annexed into the city.

                  Subdivision II. - Standards 

                  Sec. 113-200. - Applicability. 
                  Unlike other developments in the city, a gated residential development, where a gate is placed at the outer periphery of the development in order to restrict access, may be allowed to have private streets that are not owned and maintained by the city. All gated residential developments must be developed in accordance with the regulations of this subdivision, other applicable regulations of this chapter, and the city's zoning ordinance. 
                  (Ord. No. 08-01, § II(intro. ¶), 1-15-2008) 
                  Sec. 113-201. - Entrances. 
                  The design and layout of any gatehouse, entry gates, external fence, walls, and berms shall be located outside any public street right-of-way and shall be designed to blend in, to the greatest degree feasible, with the proposed development and be attractive to motorists and pedestrians from adjoining public streets. Gatehouses and entry gates shall be located outside any required buffer areas. Entry gates shall be set back sufficiently far from public street entrances to allow for stacking of at least three vehicles out of the public travel lanes. An additional setback between the point of the access control device and the entry gate shall be required to allow a vehicle which is denied access to safely turn around and exit onto a public street. Pedestrian access to the gated residential development shall be provided at its entrance outside of the vehicle travel lanes. Entry gates shall have sufficient minimum gate widths and openings to allow safe passage of all vehicles permitted to use public roadways. Overhead barriers or obstructions shall not be allowed above entry gates.

                  Sec. 113-202. - Design standards. 
                  With the exception of the placement of a gate and guardhouse in a private street right-of-way, all private roads, traffic signs and markings shall meet all applicable minimum right-of-way, pavement, construction, and design standards for public roads as established by the city. The city reserves the right to have streets inspected during the construction phase to ensure that they are being built in accordance with all applicable standards.

                  Sec. 113-203. - Maintenance. 
                  Prior to the approval of a final plat, the subdivider shall submit to the city evidence that the subdivider has created a homeowners' association whose responsibility it will be to maintain common areas, private utilities, private streets, curb and gutter and sidewalks within the subdivision. Such evidence shall include filed copies of the articles of incorporation, declarations, and homeowners' association bylaws. The maintenance and upkeep of any guardhouses or entry structures, and subdivision walls, fences, or berms located at the external periphery of the subdivision as well as internal streets, curb, gutter, sidewalks and utilities shall be the sole responsibility of the subdivider and/or any duly incorporated and active homeowners' association.

                  Sec. 113-204. - Access. 
                  (a)  The subdivider and homeowners' association shall guarantee access to all private streets by emergency and law enforcement vehicles. Access procedures must ensure immediate access through the entry gates for emergency and law enforcement vehicles responding to emergencies. Approach and departure areas on both sides of a gated entrance must provide adequate setbacks and proper alignment to allow free and unimpeded passage of emergency vehicles through the entrance area. The subdivider shall provide documentation from city fire chief or his designee that proposed entry gates and access procedures meet all city standards for access by emergency and law enforcement vehicles. 
                  (b)  The subdivider and homeowners' association shall guarantee access to all private streets by the city, county agencies, state agencies, and all public utility companies. City, county and state officials and staff shall be permitted entry to the gated residential development to perform zoning, inspections and other governmental regulatory activities. Public utility company vehicles and personnel shall be permitted entry to the gated residential development to perform installation and maintenance activities of public utility infrastructure. A statement to this effect shall appear on or accompany the final plat. 
                  (c)  If the homeowners' association fails to maintain reliable access for the provision of emergency or other public services, the city may enter the gated residential development and open, disable or remove any gate or device, which is a barrier to access, at the sole expense of the homeowners' association. The declaration of covenants, conditions and restrictions and any other relevant documents of the homeowners' association shall include this provision.

                  Sec. 113-229. - Street and alley improvements. 
                  (a)  Required paving. 
                  (1)  Pavement widths shall conform to the following: 

                   
                  (2)  Paving shall be required for all service streets and marginal access streets within a subdivision any portion of which lies within the city district or the county urban district and shall conform to the following requirements: 
                  a.  All service and marginal access streets within areas of primarily residential use shall be properly graded and provided with a minimum of six inches of compacted, approved sand clay or soil cement base and a double surface bituminous treatment, all in accordance with city (county) standards. 
                  b.  All service and marginal access streets serving industrial and commercial areas shall be graded and paved in accordance with city (county) standards relating thereto. 
                  (3)  Provided that the entire right-of-way of a proposed or existing connector street (as specified by the planning commission under section 113-140(i)) has been dedicated to or purchased by the city (county) and provided that the street provides access to adjoining lots, the subdivider shall grade and pave such street in accordance with city (county) standards and shall be reimbursed one-half the cost of these improvements. If such street does not provide access to adjoining lots, the subdivider may be required, at the option of the city (county), to grade and pave such street, with reimbursement of the total cost thereof. 
                  (4)  With respect to the platted portion of a street extended past a street intersection to a subdivision boundary where the adjacent property is unplatted and which need not be opened for circulation within the particular subdivision, the planning commission may relieve the subdivider of the street improvements otherwise required thereon. Such improvements shall be installed by the subsequent subdivider of adjacent land whose street connects therewith. 
                  (b)  Grading. Regardless of whether paving is required in the particular district (section 113-141(a)), proper grading shall be carried out in accordance with the plans and data specified in section 113-111(c); and where paving is not provided, the roadway width shall be at least 34 feet. 
                  (c)  Curb and gutter. Curb and gutter shall be required for all service streets and marginal access streets within a subdivision any portion of which lies within the city district or county urban district and having a typical lot width at the building line ranging from 66 feet to 150 feet. The subdivider shall be reimbursed one-half the cost of the curb and gutter; and the city (county) may, at the option of the subdivider, install the curb and gutter in lieu of reimbursement, such installation to be the subject of an agreement executed by both parties. Should the subdivider elect to install curb and gutter in subdivisions where it is not required, the immediately preceding provision relating to reimbursement and installation shall apply. Curb and gutter shall not be limited to any specific type but shall meet the requirements of the city (county) engineer. 
                  (d)  Storm sewer, catchbasin, and manholes. If the subdivision is within a drainage basin wherein a system of storm sewers is deemed necessary by the city (county) engineer, storm sewers, catchbasins and manholes, all built to city (county) standards, shall be provided. In accordance with such standards, the city (county) engineer shall approve the size and material of the sewers and shall determine the method of their connection with the overall system for the basin. The subdivider shall be reimbursed a portion of the cost of the required drainage facilities, in accordance with the following provisions: 
                  (1)  For that part of a storm sewer adjacent or within his subdivision, the subdivider shall be reimbursed for that portion of the cost of the main in excess of the cost of a main of adequate size for his particular subdivision. 
                  (2)  For that part of a storm sewer system not adjacent or within his subdivision but required as part of the overall drainage system the subdivider shall be reimbursed for the amount in excess of the cost of an improved open drainage ditch of adequate size, the city (county) also to bear all costs of easements or right-of-way. 
                  For every subdivision, a system of drainage, including on-site and off-site facilities, shall be subject to approval by the city (county) engineer; and if storm sewers are impracticable, the subdivider shall provide all ditches and culverts necessary to connect with existing drainage, where the easements are provided by the city (county). 
                  (e)  Alleys. All alleys will be graded for the full 20-foot width, shall be provided with concrete aprons to all street intersections which are paved or to be paved in accordance with this chapter, and shall be properly drained, all in accordance with city (county) standards. 
                  (f)  Street marker signs. Street name signs, of the design and material specified in city (county) standards, shall be installed at all intersections of a subdivision any portion of which lies within the city district, county urban district, or county suburban district. 
                  (Ord. of 7-7-1964, § IV(B); Ord. No. 08-04, § 2, 2-19-2008) 
                  Sec. 113-230. - Utilities. 
                  (a)  Water. A subdivision any portion of which is located within 500 feet of a public water system approved by the county health department shall be connected therewith, provided that mains within that distance can adequately serve the subdivision. Mains shall be provided by the subdivider from point of connection with the public water system to the subdivision; and all mains and service connections necessary to properly serve the subdivision shall be provided and shall be of a size that will furnish at least 15 gallons per minute to each anticipated dwelling unit, the number of dwelling units to be determined by the planning commission based upon the number of parcels for single-family and multiple-family dwelling units indicated on preliminary plat data and upon zoning restrictions (if any), and that will furnish adequate quantity and pressure for fire protection within 1,000 feet of each anticipated dwelling unit. Water lines shall conform with accepted standards of good practice for municipal water systems and shall meet, as a minimum, the specifications of the city water department and the county health department. Where a subdivision is not within 500 feet of an approved public water supply, a community water system approved by the county health department and the city (county) engineer may be provided, in which case deed or plat covenants shall establish a perpetual maintenance organization of property owners so that there is reasonable assurance of proper maintenance; or else the subdivision may be designed for individual water systems, to be installed in accordance with the standards of the county health department. 
                  (b)  Sewer. When the nearest boundary of the subdivision is located within 500 feet of public sewerage system, sanitary sewers shall be installed and connected with the public system provided that gravity flow is feasible. Mains shall be provided by the subdivider from point of connection with the public sanitary sewer to the subdivision and all mains and service connections necessary to properly serve the subdivision shall be provided. Mains shall be at least eight inches in diameter or of such larger size as may be determined by the city water department, provided that a six-inch main which is not over 400 feet in length may be permitted where topographic conditions prohibit further extension of the main; service connections shall be of four inch diameter. Where the subdivision is not within 500 feet of a public sewerage system, a community sewerage system of design approved by the county health department and the city (county) engineer may be provided, in which case deed or plat covenants shall establish a perpetual maintenance organization of property owners so that there is reasonable assurance of proper maintenance; or the subdivider may provide individual septic tanks and disposal fields, which shall meet the standards of the county health department and the city (county) engineer. The lots to contain individual septic tanks and disposal fields shall meet the minimum area requirements of section 113-143(c)(1) and (2) and may be required by the county health department to have larger areas where the results of percolation tests show that additional area is necessary. 
                  (c)  Installation of utilities. After rough grading is completed and approved and before any base is applied to the street, all of the underground work (water mains, gas mains, etc., and all service connections) shall be installed completely and approved throughout the length of the road and across the flat section. Where the utility mains are off the pavement, the developer may elect to omit the installation of service connections providing that at such time as these service connections are needed, they may be jacked across the roadway without breaking or weakening the existing pavement. 
                  (d)  Distribution of utility cost. 
                  (1)  The subdivider shall be responsible for providing and installing all water and sewer lines and connections, in compliance with subsections (a) and (b) of this section, and shall bear the entire expense subject to the following provisions relating to reimbursement by the city (county): 
                  a.  For that part of a utility main adjacent or within his subdivision, the subdivider shall be reimbursed for that portion of the cost of the main in excess of the cost of a main of adequate size for his particular subdivision. 
                  b.  For that part of a utility main which is not within or adjacent to the subdivision, the subdivider shall be reimbursed one-half the entire cost of the main. 
                  (2)  In making reimbursement under the foregoing provisions, the city (county) may, upon approval by the subdivider, install utility lines and substitute charges for such installation as a part or all of its reimbursement, such installation to be the subject of an agreement executed by both parties and specifying the amount of such charges, as determined in accordance with standard rates established by the city water department for each utility and type of construction. 
                  (3)  No private equity shall remain or rest in any water or sanitary sewer main or service connection thereof or in any drainage vehicle.

                  (1)  Curb and gutter and pavement. Curb and gutter or concrete edging, not reimbursable by city (county), and pavement shall be required for streets within parks or subdivisions. In each case, the paved roadway shall be centered within the right-of-way; and the roadway shall not be less in width (between curbs, where used) than the following: 

                   
                  (2)  Accessway. A properly located curb cut (where applicable) and an accessway, for the purpose of maneuvering the mobile home into position, shall be provided on each lot within a park or subdivision and shall be at least 12 feet in width, with gradient, not to exceed eight percent. 
                  (3)  Mobile home stand. A stand for parking the mobile home shall be provided on each lot within a park in accordance with Federal Housing Administration regulations and city (county) standards. 
                  (4)  Mobile home patio. A patio shall be provided on each lot within a park or subdivision in accordance with Federal Housing Administration regulations and city (county) standards. 
                  (5)  Utilities. Each park or subdivision shall be connected with a public water or sewerage system if within 500 feet thereof; and if not within 500 feet, it shall provide its own community system or connect with a public system, such utilities to meet all provisions of section 113-230(a) and (b) applicable thereto. Septic tanks and drainage fields for individual lots shall not be permitted. 
                  (6)  Storm drainage. Where curb and gutter is used, a storm sewer system shall be provided. Where concrete edging is used, storm drainage ditches will be located at the periphery of the park or subdivision (rather than along the interior streets); and the entire site of the park or subdivision shall be graded to permit such drainage.
