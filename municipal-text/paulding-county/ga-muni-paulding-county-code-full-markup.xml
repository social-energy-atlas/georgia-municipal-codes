         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE                   This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of Paulding County, Georgia. 
                  Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1987 Code, as supplemented through October 1995, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the board of commissioners. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1987 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
                  The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
                  Chapter and Section Numbering System 
                  The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
                  Page Numbering System 
                  The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

                   
                  Indexes 
                  The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
                  Looseleaf Supplements 
                  A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
                  Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
                  Acknowledgments 
                  This publication was under the direct supervision of Ron K. McLaughlin, Senior Code Attorney, and William B. Eddy, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida.

                  The publisher is most grateful to Lani Skipper, Assistant County Attorney; Pat Westbrook, County Administrator; and Beverly Cochran, County Clerk, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication.

The persons sponsoring such petition shall address such petition to the judge of the probate court, petitioning him to call for a special election to submit the question of whether the chairman or any such member of the board of commissioners shall be recalled. Prior to obtaining any signatures on any such petitions, a blank copy of the proposed petition shall be submitted to the Judge of the Probate Court of Paulding County with a notice that a petition is to circulated seeking signatures for a special election for the recall of the chairman or a member or members of the Board of Commissioners of Paulding County. The petition shall be submitted to the judge of the probate court with the required signatures within 45 days following the date on which the notice of the proposed petition is given to the judge of the probate court. If such petition is not submitted within the 45 day time limit it shall be void and of no force or effect. Upon submission of the petition to the judge of the probate court it shall be the duty of the judge to determine whether such petition bears the proper percentage of names and to determine the sufficiency of the petition.

In the event he determines the petition is in order, it shall be the duty of the judge of the probate court to issue the call for the election and such call shall be issued within five days following the date that he determines the petition is in order. He shall set the date of the election for not less than 30 nor more than 45 days following the issuance of the call. It shall be his further duty to publish the date and purposes of such election once a week for two weeks immediately preceding the date thereof in the official organ of the county in which the sheriff's advertisements appear. The ballots used in such election shall state the name of the officer whose recall has been petitioned and shall designate the office involved.

If a majority of those voting vote against recall, the member shall remain in office. It shall be the duty of the judge of the probate court to hold and conduct the election and to declare and certify the results. It shall be his further duty to certify the results to the Secretary of State. If a petition is denied as not having a sufficient number of signatures or if a majority of those voting in the recall election vote against recall, no new petition shall be presented to the judge of the probate court within one year from the date of the submission of the previous petition. Vacancies created by recall shall be filled in the same manner as other vacancies. Any person who is recalled from office under the provisions of this Section shall be eligible to fill the vacancies created by such recall.

                  (b)  The Board of Commissioners shall be authorized to provide the Chairman with a County-owned automobile which the Chairman may use in carrying out his official duties, and the county funds may be expended for the operation and maintenance of said automobile.

If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue shall exceed the amount required for the purpose for which such bonds are issued, the surplus shall be paid into a sinking fund or used for additional construction as may be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture.

                  Sec. 316. - Conditions precedent to issuance, object of issuance. 
                  Such revenue bonds may be issued without any other proceedings or the happening of any other conditions or things than those proceedings, conditions and things which are specified or required by this Act.

                  Sec. 317. - Credit not pledged. 
                  Revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act shall not be deemed to constitute a debt of Paulding County.

                  Sec. 318. - Trust indenture as security. 
                  In the discretion of the Authority any issue of such revenue bonds may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the Authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or outside of the State. Such trust indenture may pledge or assign fees, tolls, revenues and earnings to be received by the Authority, including the proceeds derived from the sale of any surplus property of the Authority, both real and personal. Either the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or such trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the Authority in relation to the acquisition of property, the construction of the project, the maintenance, operation, repair and insurance of the property, and the custody, safeguarding and application of all monies, including the proceeds derived from the sale of property of the Authority, both real and personal, and may also provide that any project shall be constructed and paid for under the supervision and approval of consulting engineers or architects employed or designated by the Authority, and satisfactory to the original purchasers of the bonds issued therefor, and may also require that the security given by contractors and by any depository of the proceeds of the bonds or revenues or other monies be satisfactory to such purchasers, and may also contain provisions concerning the conditions, if any, upon which additional revenue bonds may be issued. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this State to act as such depository and to furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the Authority. Such indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee, and may restrict the individual right of action of bondholders as is customary in trust indentures securing bonds and debentures of corporations. In addition to the foregoing, such trust indenture may contain such other provisions as the Authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation and repair of the project affected by such indenture.

                  Sec. 319. - To whom proceeds of bonds shall be paid. 
                  In the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, the Authority shall provide for the payment of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds to any officer or person who, or any agency, bank or trust company, which shall act as trustee of such funds and shall hold and apply the same to the purposes hereof, subject to such regulations as this Act and such resolutions or trust indentures may provide.

                  Sec. 320. - Sinking fund. 
                  The revenues, fees, tolls and earnings derived from any particular project or projects, regardless of whether or not such fees, earnings and revenues were produced by a particular project for which bonds have been issued, and any monies derived from the sale of any properties, both real and personal, of the Authority, unless otherwise pledged and allocated, may be pledged and allocated by the Authority to the payment of the principal and interest on revenue bonds of the Authority as the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or the trust instrument may provide. Such funds so pledged from whatever source received, which said pledge may include funds received from one or more or all sources, shall be set aside at regular intervals, as may be provided in the resolution or trust indenture, into a sinking fund. Said sinking fund shall be pledged to and charged with the payments of (1) the interest upon such revenue bonds as such interest shall fall due, (2) the principal of the bonds as the same shall fall due, (3) the necessary charges of paying agent or agents for paying interest and principal, and (4) any premium upon bonds retired by call or purchase as hereinabove provided. The use and disposition of such sinking fund shall be subject to such regulations as may be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, but, except as may otherwise be provided in such resolution or trust indenture, such sinking fund shall be a fund for the benefit of all revenue bonds without distinction or priority of one over another. Subject to the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture, surplus monies in the sinking fund may be applied to the purchase or redemption of bonds, and any such bonds so purchased or redeemed shall forthwith be cancelled and shall not again be issued.

                  Sec. 321. - Remedies of bondholders. 
                  Any holder of revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act or any of the coupons appertaining thereto, and the trustee under the trust indenture, if any, except to the extent the rights herein given may be restricted by resolution passed before the issuance of the bonds or by the trust indenture, may protect and enforce, either at law or in equity, by suit, action, mandamus, or other proceedings, any and all rights under the laws of the State of Georgia or granted hereunder or under such resolution or trust indenture, and may enforce and compel performance of all duties required by this Act or by such resolution or trust indenture, to be performed by the Authority, or any officer thereof, including the fixing, charging and collecting of revenues, fees, tolls and other charges for the use of the facilities and services furnished.

Such municipality, county, authority, subdivision or instrumentality shall be required to show cause, if any, why such contract or contracts and the terms and conditions thereof should not be inquired into by the court and the validity of the terms thereof be determined and the contract or contracts adjudicated as security for the payment of any such bonds of the Authority. The bonds, when validated, and the judgment of validation shall be final and conclusive with respect to such bonds, against the Authority issuing the same, and any municipality, county, authority, subdivision or instrumentality of the United States Government if a party to the validation proceedings, contracting with the said Paulding County Airport Authority.

                  Sec. 325. - Interest of bondholders protected. 
                  While any of the bonds issued by the Authority remain outstanding, the powers, duties or existence of said Authority or of its officers, employees or agents shall not be diminished or impaired in any manner that will adversely affect the interest and rights of the holders of such bonds, and no other entity, department, agency or authority shall be created which will compete with the Authority to such an extent as to affect adversely the interest and rights of the holders of such bonds, nor will the State itself so compete with the Authority. The provisions of this Act shall be for the benefit of the State, the Authority and the holders of any such bonds, and upon the issuance of bonds under the provisions hereof, shall constitute a contract with the holders of such bonds.

                  Editor's note— This constitutional amendment was specifically continued in force and effect as a part of the constitution of the state by 1987 Ga. Laws, page 3576. 

                  Sec. 351. - [Created; membership.] 
                  Article V, Section IX of the Constitution is hereby amended by adding at the end thereof a new paragraph which shall read as follows: 
                  A.  There is hereby created a body corporate and politic in Paulding County to be known as the Paulding County Industrial Building Authority, which shall be an instrumentality of Paulding County and a public corporation and which in this amendment is hereafter referred to as the "Authority"; 
                  B.  The Authority shall consist of six (6) members as follows: The Mayor of the City of Dallas, the Mayor of the City of Hiram, the President of the Paulding County Chamber of Commerce, the governing head of Paulding County, and two (2) members which shall be appointed by the governing head of Paulding County for a term of three (3) years, who shall be eligible for reappointment. In case of a vacancy for an unexpired term said governing Authority of Paulding County shall appoint such person to fill said vacancy. A majority of members shall constitute a quorum and a majority may act for the authority in any matter. No vacancy shall impair the power of the Authority to act. 
                  C.  The property, obligations and the interest on the obligations of the Authority shall have the same immunity from taxation as the property, obligations and interest on the obligations of Paulding County. 
                  D.  The powers of the Authority shall include, but not be limited to, the power: 
                  (1)  To receive and administer gifts, grants and donations and to administer trusts; 
                  (2)  To borrow money, to issue notes, bonds and revenue certificates, to execute trust agreements or indentures, and to sell, convey, mortgage, pledge and assign any and all of its funds, property and income as security therefor; 
                  (3)  To contract with political subdivisions of the State of Georgia and with private persons and corporations and to sue and be sued in its corporate name; 
                  (4)  To have and exercise usual powers of private corporation except such as are inconsistent with this amendment, including the power to appoint and hire officers, agents and employees and to provide their compensation and duties, which officers and agents may not be members of the Authority, and the power to adopt and amend a corporate seal and by-laws and regulations for the conduct and management of the Authority; 
                  (5)  To encourage and promote the expansion and development of industrial and commercial facilities in Paulding County so as to relieve insofar as possible unemployment within its boundaries, and to that end to acquire by purchase or gift any building or structure within the limits of Paulding County, suitable for and intended for use as a factory, mill, shop, processing plant, assembly plant, or fabricating plant, including all necessary and appurtenant lands and appurtenances thereto, and all necessary or useful furnishings machinery and equipment. Such acquisition may be through the acquisition of land and the construction thereon of a building, including the demolition of existing structures, or through the acquisition of an existing building and the remodeling, renovating, reconstructing, furnishing and equipping of such building; 
                  (6)  No building acquired hereunder shall be operated by the Authority but shall be leased or sold to one or more persons, firms or corporations. If sold, the purchase price may be paid at one time or in installments falling due in not more than thirty (30) years from the date of transfer of possession. The lessee or purchaser shall be required to pay all costs of operating and maintaining the building or buildings and to pay rentals or installments sufficient, together with other revenues which may be pledged for the purpose, to retire all bonds, both principal and interest, and to pay all other expenses which the Authority may have incurred in connection with the undertaking. 
                  (7)  To accumulate its funds from year to year and to invest accumulated funds in any manner that public funds of the State of Georgia or any of its political subdivisions may be invested; 
                  (8)  To designate officers to sign and act for the Authority generally or in any specific matter; 
                  (9)  To do any and all acts and things necessary or convenient to accomplish the purpose and powers of the Authority as herein stated. 
                  E.  The Authority shall not be authorized to create in any manner any debt, liability or obligation against the State of Georgia or Paulding County. 
                  F.  The members of the Authority shall receive no compensation for their services to the Authority except for expenses actually incurred in carrying out the official business of said Authority. 
                  G.  In order to finance any undertaking within the scope of its power or to refund any bonds then outstanding, the Authority is hereby authorized to issue bonds bearing rate or rates of interest and maturing at the years and amounts determined by the Authority and the procedure of validation, issuance and delivery shall be in all respects in accordance with the Revenue Bond Law (1937 Ga. Laws, page 761) as amended, Ga. Code Ann. Supp. Chapter 87-8, as if said obligations had been originally authorized to be issued thereunder; provided, however, that any property, real or personal, of the Authority may be pledged, mortgaged, conveyed, assigned, hypothecated or otherwise incumbered as security for any lawful debt of the Authority. The Authority may execute any trust agreement or indenture not in conflict with the provisions of this amendment to provide security for any bonds issued as provided herein, and such trust agreement or indenture may provide for foreclosure or forced sale of any property of the Authority upon default on such bonds either in payment of principal or interest or under any term or condition under which such bonds are issued. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to create a right to compel any exercise of the taxing power of Paulding County to pay any such bonds or the interest thereon nor to enforce payment thereof against any property of Paulding County. 
                  H.  The Authority may authorize additional bonds, for extensions and permanent improvements to any industrial building acquired hereunder, to be placed in escrow and to be negotiated from time to time as proceeds for that purpose may become necessary. Bonds so placed in escrow shall, when sold and delivered, have such standing with the bonds of the same issue as may be provided in the authorizing proceedings. 
                  I.  No bonds except refunding bonds shall be issued hereunder unless the Authority shall have found and declared that: 
                  (1)  The undertaking for which the bonds are to be issued will increase employment in Paulding County. 
                  (2)  The lessee or purchaser of the building or buildings involved will not by virtue of establishing operations in said County, reduce the number of employees employed by said lessee or purchaser elsewhere in the State of Georgia. 
                  J.  No moneys derived by the Authority from any source other than gifts and contributions from private individuals, firms or corporations shall at any time be used for entertainment, or other promotional expenses. 
                  K.  Should said Authority for any reason be dissolved, title to all property of every kind and nature, real and personal, held by the Authority at the time of such dissolution shall revert to Paulding County subject to any mortgages, liens, leases or other encumbrances outstanding against or in respect to said property at that time. 
                  L.  This amendment is adopted for the purpose of promoting and expanding for the public good and welfare industry and trade within Paulding County and reducing unemployment to the greatest extent possible, and this amendment and any law enacted with reference to the Authority shall be liberally construed for the accomplishment of these purposes. 
                  M.  This amendment shall be effective immediately upon proclamation of its ratification by the Governor and the first members of the Authority shall be appointed within thirty (30) days after such proclamation. 
                  N.  The General Assembly may by law further define and prescribe the powers and duties of the Authority and the exercise thereof, and may enlarge and restrict the same, and may likewise further regulate the management and conduct of the Authority. The Authority shall be an instrumentality of Paulding County and the scope of its operations shall be limited to the territory embraced within said county. The General Assembly shall not extend the jurisdiction of the Authority nor the scope of its operations beyond such limits."

The terms do not include other county elected officials, county employees, the county attorney, the executive assistant to the board of commissioners, the comptroller, or department heads or chief executive officers, by whatever names designated, of the various departments of the county.

                  Sec. 2-86. - Main motion. 
                  In order for the board of commissioners to take any official action on any subject, a commissioner, including the chair, must propose a main motion. A proposed main motion will not be recognized until another commissioner agrees to second the motion. A second does not require the commissioner seconding the motion to support the motion.

                  Sec. 2-87. - Debate. 
                  (a)  After the main motion is recognized by the chair, the board of commissioners shall debate the motion. The debate shall be managed by the chair in a manner that is fair to all members of the board. Commissioners can participate in the debate only when they are recognized by the chair. 
                  (b)  During the course of debate, commissioners may introduce subsidiary motions that propose that the board take a particular action on a motion (section 2-54). There are two classes of subsidiary motions: debatable subsidiary motions and undebatable subsidiary motions. Debatable subsidiary motions consist of motions to postpone indefinitely, amend, refer to committee, and postpone to a time certain. Debatable subsidiary motions require a second before they can be voted on or debated. There are three undebatable subsidiary motions: limit debate, vote immediately, and lay on the table. These motions require a second and cannot be debated. 
                  (c)  Commissioners may also introduce privileged motions (section 2-91). Privileged motions facilitate the running of the meeting and can be introduced during the course of debate. Privileged motions consist of a motion to raise a question of privilege and motions to recess and adjourn. The motions to recess and adjourn require a second. Debate is not allowed on privileged motions.

                  (1)  Debatable motions. In the case of debatable motions, the vote can be proposed in one of two ways: 
                  a.  If debate has been completed and no other commissioner wishes to speak, the chair can call for the vote. If there are no objections to ending debate then the chair can proceed with the vote; 
                  b.  If the chair calls for the vote and there is an objection to ending debate, a member of the board may move to vote immediately (move the previous question). 
                  If this motion is seconded and approved by a majority vote of the board (at least three commissioners who are present and voting or two commissioners who are present and voting and the chair), debate will stop. The chair will then read the proposed motion to the board and ask for the votes of the commissioners. 
                  (2)  Undebatable motions. In the case of undebatable motions, the vote shall occur immediately after the motion is recognized by the chair. The chair shall read the proposed motion to the board and then call for the vote.

                  (a)  Each subsidiary and privileged motion is assigned a specific rank. A motion of higher precedence can interrupt a motion of lower precedence. The higher motion must be decided before the board returns to consider the motion of lower precedence. 
                  (b)  A main motion has the lowest rank and does not take precedence over any other motion. A motion to adjourn has the highest rank and will take precedence over all subsidiary and privileged motions. The order of precedence of motions shall be in accordance with this section. Motions at the top of the following list take precedence over motions at the bottom of the list: 
                  (1)  Privileged motions (undebatable), (highest rank): 
                  a.  Adjourn. 
                  b.  Recess. 
                  c.  Question of privilege. 
                  (2)  Subsidiary motions (undebatable): 
                  a.  Lay on the table (postpone temporarily). 
                  b.  Vote immediately (previous question). 
                  c.  Limit debate or extend. 
                  (3)  Subsidiary motions (debatable): 
                  a.  Postpone to a time certain (postpone definitely). 
                  b.  Refer to committee (commit). 
                  c.  Amend. 
                  d.  Postpone indefinitely. 
                  (4)  Other motions (lowest rank): Main motion. 
                  (Res. No. 99-01(B), § 1-04, 1-12-1999) 
                  Sec. 2-90. - Subsidiary motions. 
                  During the course of debate, any commissioner may introduce motions that propose that the board take a particular action on a main motion. These motions are called subsidiary motions and they allow the board to reach a conclusion on the main motion. Subsidiary motions require a second before they can be voted on or debated. Three subsidiary motions, amend, limit debate and vote immediately, also can apply to other subsidiary motions. 
                  (1)  Postpone indefinitely. If any commissioner believes that the main motion should not be considered by the board, that commissioner may move to postpone the consideration of the main motion indefinitely. If the motion is successful, consideration of the main motion stops and the main motion is tabled for the duration of the meeting. A motion to postpone indefinitely can be debated but it cannot be amended. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (2)  Amend. If any commissioner believes that a main motion that is on the table should be changed in order to make it more acceptable, he can move to amend the motion. Amendments must be closely related to the original motion and must not change the nature of the motion that they amend. Motions to refer, amend, postpone to a time certain and the motion to recess can also be amended. A motion cannot be amended more than two times. Debate is allowed on a motion to amend only if the original motion is debatable. Debate is limited to the proposed amendment. A majority vote is required for the board to adopt an amendment. If the amendment is adopted then the board shall consider the amended version of the motion. 
                  (3)  Refer to a committee (commit). If any commissioner believes that further information is needed before the board can act on a main motion, he may propose that the motion be referred to a specific committee or department for further study. If an appropriate committee does not already exist, then a committee may be formed as a part of the motion. A motion to commit should specify the date that the committee or department will report back to the board. This motion is debatable and amendable. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (4)  Postpone to a time certain (postpone definitely). A motion to postpone to a time certain may be proposed if a commissioner believes that the main motion should not be considered until a future time. This motion shall set a particular time for the main motion to be considered again. It is debatable and can be amended. If this motion is passed, the chair will bring the original motion back to the board for consideration at the specified time which may be at the same meeting, at a subsequent meeting, or upon the occurrence of a specified event. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (5)  Limit or extend limits of debate. A motion to limit debate places a time constraint on the length of debate. The details of such a motion are to be decided by the commissioner who makes the motion. This motion can also be used to extend the limits of debate if a limit on debate already exists. Debate is not allowed on this motion and a majority vote of the board is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (6)  Vote immediately (previous question). If a commissioner believes debate on a motion should end and that the motion that is being considered should be voted on, the commissioner can move to vote immediately. The motion is undebatable and a majority vote of the board is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (7)  Lay on the table (postpone temporary). A motion to lay on the table proposes that the consideration of a main motion be postponed until a later time in the same meeting. The main motion can be brought back for consideration only if a motion to resume consideration is accepted by the board during the same meeting. The motion will die if it is not taken up during the meeting. Debate is not allowed on this motion and the motion is not amendable. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (Res. No. 99-01(B), § 1-05, 1-12-1999) 
                  Sec. 2-91. - Privileged motions. 
                  Privileged motions facilitate the running of the meeting. Privileged motions do not address or relate to a main motion and can be introduced whether or not there is a main motion under consideration. Privileged motions take precedence over all subsidiary motions. Debate is not allowed on these motions. 
                  (1)  Question of privilege. A formal question addressed to the chair concerning the rights of a commissioner or of the board as a whole is referred to as a question of privilege. It does not require a second and cannot be debated or amended. The chair is required to make a ruling on the question. 
                  (2)  Recess. A motion to recess proposes that the meeting be suspended for a particular amount of time when business is still pending. It is a temporary intermission of the proceedings. The motion must specify the length of the recess. The motion must also be seconded. Debate is not allowed on this motion but the motion can be amended. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (3)  Adjourn. In order for a meeting to come to a close, a commissioner must make a motion to adjourn. The motion to adjourn has the highest rank of any motion and as a result it can be introduced at any time. The motion requires a second, but is not debatable or amendable. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (Res. No. 99-01(B), § 1-06, 1-12-1999) 
                  Sec. 2-92. - Incidental motions. 
                  Incidental motions allow commissioners to exert their rights as members of the board. Incidental motions can be introduced at any time during a meeting. 
                  (1)  Appeal. If a commissioner disagrees with a ruling that is made by the chair, that commissioner may appeal the decision. If the appeal is seconded, the appeal will be considered by the board. The chair has the opportunity to explain the ruling that has been challenged. The board may then debate the appeal. The board shall decide by majority vote if the chair's decision is to be upheld or overturned. An appeal is high in precedence and can only be interrupted by a privileged motion or by a motion to lay on the table. 
                  (2)  Parliamentary inquiry. If a commissioner has a question about the rules of order, he may ask the chair to give an opinion on that question. This question should take the form of a parliamentary inquiry and should relate to the current business of the board. This motion takes precedence over all motions except privileged motions. This motion does not require a second and is not debatable or amendable. 
                  (3)  Point of order (question of order). If a commissioner believes that a violation of the rules of parliamentary procedure has occurred, he can raise a point of order. A second is not required. The chair can make a ruling on the question or can allow the board to debate and then rule on the question by a majority vote. A point of order can only be interrupted by a privileged motion or a motion to lay on the table. 
                  (4)  Point of information (request for information). If a commissioner has a question about the facts of a particular issue that is being considered, he may ask a point of information. This motion is addressed first to the chair and then to the appropriate person. A second is not required and the motion is not debatable or amendable. 
                  (Res. No. 99-01(B), § 1-07, 1-12-1999) 
                  Sec. 2-93. - Supplementary main motion. 
                  Three motions allow the board to act on a main motion that has either been passed or tabled by the board. These motions are considered to be main motions but differ from usual main motions in the ways specified. 
                  (1)  Reconsider. The motion to reconsider allows the board to debate whether or not to overturn a decision made at the meeting that is in progress. It allows the board to consider new information that may affect the decision that has already been made. Any commissioner can make a motion to reconsider and any commissioner may second the motion. The motion is debatable but it cannot be amended. A majority vote of the board is required for the motion to pass. If a motion to reconsider is passed, the original decision will be voided and the board will return to debate and revote the original motion. 
                  (2)  Rescind. A motion to rescind proposes that the board overturn a motion passed at a previous meeting. A motion to rescind can be made by any commissioner. It is in order as long as the original motion has not been fully completed. An announcement of the intention to rescind a motion may be made at the meeting where the derision was made, or the commissioner seeking to rescind may place the matter on the agenda for the next work session meeting. The motion to rescind may then be placed on the agenda for the next work session meeting. At the next meeting, the motion to rescind will formally be made. If it is seconded, then the board shall debate and vote on rescission. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. If a motion to rescind is passed, the original decision will be voided. 
                  (3)  Resume consideration. The motion to resume consideration allows the board to consider a motion that has been temporarily postponed. This motion requires a second and is not debatable or amendable. It is a main motion but ranks higher than any debatable motion. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass.

The failure to make such request and verification in any case where the person to whom the alcoholic beverage is sold or otherwise furnished is less than 21 years of age may be considered by the trier of fact in determining whether the person selling or otherwise furnishing such alcoholic beverage did so in violation of subsection (a)(1) of this section. 
                  (g)  In any case where a person selling or otherwise furnishing alcoholic beverages checks for a proper identification, such person shall carefully inspect such identification.

An animal may be considered under control if the owner is accompanying the animal and has voice, whistle or other control over such animal and such animal is trained to respond to such voice, whistle or other control. The burden of proving that an animal is trained to respond to voice, whistle or other control remains with the owner of such animal and a rebuttable presumption exists that an animal which is not confined to the premises of its owner without being secured by a chain, leash or lead of sufficient strength or fence to prevent it from escaping is not under control of its owner.

An animal is also considered to be vicious if it makes an unprovoked attack on people, other animals or on physical property on or off it owner's property. Animal attacks shall be documented by reporting such attacks to the county animal control office. If the animal attack involves the biting of a person or another animal, the attack shall also be reported to the county animal control office. 
                  Wild and exotic animals means any monkey or other nonhuman primate, such as raccoon, skunk, wolf, squirrel, fox, leopard, panther, tiger, lion, lynx, ferret, bear, llama, wild rabbit, tarantula, wild rodent, and reptiles, including, but not limited to, crocodiles, alligators, poisonous snakes, caiman, and gavial, and any other animal so designated by the animal control department, but shall not include cats or dogs.

                  It shall be the duty of any animal owner to ensure an animal is under control of its owner and to prevent the animal from having access to the property of another person. An animal may leave the property of the animal owner, but the animal owner must have the animal under control and must prevent the animal from having access to the property of another person without the permission of that person, or from attacking, threatening or harassing other persons, or from damaging other persons' property. No animal shall be allowed to roam free and when not on the property of its owner must be on a leash, or similar physical control device, and in the control of a person. This section shall not apply to community cats or community cat caregivers. 
                  Any owner of a domestic animal will confine that animal inside a building or fenced enclosure. No animal shall be tied as a permanent measure of restraint, nor left unattended on a chain, lead, runner, cable, rope, leash, or similar tethering device in an unfenced area where people or other animals can wander into the tethered animal's proximity. Any animal owner restraining an animal without the use of a fenced enclosure will be in violation of this chapter.

This paragraph shall not apply to: 
                  (1)  Persons using guide dogs or assistance dogs;

                  Sec. 14-14. - Vicious animals. 
                  Any owner of a vicious animal shall confine it within a building or secured enclosure (sufficient to prevent the animal from escaping and to prevent a person or another animal from entering the enclosure) and will not remove it from such building or fenced enclosure unless it is securely muzzled and under restraint by a person who is at least 18 years of age or older. Any vicious animal not secured as provided in this chapter is hereby declared a nuisance and may be impounded pursuant to the provisions of this chapter and/or confined by the animal control department for a period of 30 days, provided that, if an action is brought in any court of competent jurisdiction concerning the attack or attempt to attack by such animal, the period of confinement may be extended within the discretion of the animal control department, until the entry of a final order of disposition in such action. Further, in any prosecution of an owner or a responsible person of any vicious animal for any violation of this chapter, the court may, upon conviction entered against the owner or responsible person, order that the animal be humanely destroyed.

                  Sec. 14-15. - Animal noises/barking. 
                  (a)  It shall be unlawful for any person to permit a domestic animal under his or her ownership or possession to disturb the peace of any other person by loud, persistent, habitual barking, howling, growling, yelping or whining. No person shall be charged with violating this subsection unless a written warning has previously been issued by an animal control officer within 90 days of the charged violation. No citation for violation of this subsection shall be issued unless there are at least two complaining witnesses who shall have signed a written statement stating the address of the dog owner, a description of the dog and of the offense date, time and location of the offense. 
                  (b)  It shall be a violation of this chapter for an owner or an individual in possession of the property upon which the animal or animals are being located at the time of the offense to allow the animal or animals to make any vocalizations listed in subsection (a) above which are plainly audible to a person of ordinary hearing ability not located on the same property as the animal or animals making such vocalizations for more than 15 minutes without interruption or more than 30 minutes if the vocalization is intermittent. 
                  (1)  These time limits do not apply if the vocalizations are given as a warning to the presence of a person trespassing, threatening to trespass or unambiguously taunting the animal. 
                  (2)  Animal control officers enforcing this subsection are not required to measure the vocalizations with the use of a sound level meter. 
                  (3)  Upon notification of a complaint concerning such vocalizations, the owner or individual in possession of the property upon which the animal or animals are located shall be given a written notice from the animal control division indicating that such animal or animals are creating a disturbance and advising the owner or individual in possession of the property of some possible solutions to rectify the nuisance. The complainant must provide the officer the address where the animal or animals were located at the time of the offense before any written notice shall be sent. The owner or individual in possession of the property shall then have ten days to resolve the disturbance. 
                  (4)  If the disturbance is not resolved within ten days and the animal control division receives a second complaint from the original complainant, he will be asked to provide a sworn statement documenting the violations. Upon receipt of the complainant's sworn statement, the animal welfare division may, if satisfied that sufficient evidence is shown, issue a citation in accordance with the requirements of this chapter. Sufficient evidence can include, but is not limited to, any of the following: 
                  a.  A second sworn statement regarding the vocalizations from another individual residing at a different address located near the animal(s) creating the disturbance. 
                  b.  Video or other similar visual and audio recordings of the animal or animals while the disturbance is ongoing as provided for above. 
                  c.  Other sufficient evidence regarding the vocalizations. 
                  (5)  If the disturbance is not resolved within ten days and the animal control division receives another complaint from another individual residing at a different address located near the animal or animals creating the disturbance, both complainants will be asked to provide a sworn statement. Upon receipt of the sworn statements, the animal control division may issue a citation in accordance with the requirements of this chapter. 
                  (6)  The original complaint will remain on file and active for a period of 90 days following the ten-day resolution period. If no further complaints are made during the 90-day period, the complaint shall expire and the process begins again. 
                  (7)  An example of the complaint form is as follows: 
                  Instructions for Barking Dog Complaint Form 
                  In order to issue a citation for a barking dog complaint, animal control must have issued a written warning to the owner within the past 90 days. All barking dog complaint citations require at least two witnesses that have signed a written statement stating the address of the animal owner, a description of the dog and of the offense, and the date, time, location of the offense. It is important that both witnesses' statements are about the same events (not two separate event dates). If the owner of the dog contests the citation, all witnesses may be subpoenaed to testify in Magistrate Court regarding the Complaint. If the complainant refuses to appear in court as witness, the citation will be dismissed. Once completed and signed, the original barking complaint form may be submitted to animal control in person or by mail. No fax or email submissions will be accepted.

                  (a)  Permit intent. A permit issued shall be construed to be a license to proceed with the work and not as authority to violate, cancel, alter or set aside any of the provisions of the technical codes, nor shall issuance of a permit prevent the county building official from thereafter requiring a correction of errors in plans, construction or violations of this chapter. Every permit issued shall become invalid unless the work authorized by such permit is commenced within six months after its issuance, or if the work authorized by such permit is suspended or abandoned for a period of six months after the time the work is commenced.

Extensions shall be in writing by the county building official. 
                  (b)  Permit issued on basis of an affidavit. Whenever a permit is issued in reliance upon an affidavit or whenever the work to be covered by a permit involves installation under conditions that, in the opinion of the county building official, are hazardous or complex, the county building official shall require that registered architects or engineers shall supervise such work. In addition, they shall be responsible for conformity with the permit, provide copies of inspection reports as inspections are performed, and upon completion make and file with the county building official written affidavit that the work has been done in conformity with the reviewed plans and with the structural provisions of the technical codes. If such architect or engineer is not available, the owner shall employ in his stead a competent person or agency whose qualifications are reviewed by the county building official. 
                  (c)  Plans. When the county building official issues a permit, he shall enforce, in writing or by stamp, both sets of plans "Reviewed for Code Compliance." One set of drawings so reviewed shall be retained by the county building official and the other set shall be returned to the applicant. The permitted drawings shall be kept at the site of work and shall be open to inspection by the county building official or his authorized representative.

                  Sec. 30-91. - Definitions. 
                  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this article, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Administrative fee means a component of an occupation tax which approximates the reasonable cost of handling and processing the occupation tax. 
                  Business refers to any person, private enterprise, company, or corporation that engages in goods and services exchanged for one another or for monetary gain, either directly or indirectly. 
                  Business license or occupation tax certificate means the actual document that is issued upon compliance with this article and payment of the applicable tax, administrative fee, and any interest as applicable. The use of the term "business license" has become commonplace in referring to the occupation tax certificate. Its use in this regard is not intended to be construed as a legal or formal licensing requirement but rather only as referring to an occupation tax certificate, the issuance of which shows compliance with the occupation tax requirements of this article. 
                  Dominant line means the type of business, within a multiple-line business, that the greatest amount of income is derived from. 
                  Employee means an individual whose work is performed under the supervision of the employer and whose employer withholds FICA, federal income tax, or state income tax from such individual's compensation or whose employer issues to such individual for purposes of documenting compensation a form I.R.S. W-2 but not a form I.R.S. 1099. 
                  Location of office means any structure where a business, profession, or occupation is conducted. 
                  Occupation tax means a tax levied on persons, partnerships, corporations, or other entities for engaging in an occupation, profession, or business for revenue raising purposes. 
                  Person shall be held to include sole proprietors, corporations, partnerships or any other form of business organization. 
                  Practitioner of profession or occupation means one who by state law requires state licensure regulating such profession or occupation. This term shall not include a practitioner who is an employee of a business, if the business pays an occupation tax. 
                  Regulatory fees means payments, whether designated as license fees, permit fees, or by another name, which are required by a local government as an exercise of its police power and as a part of or an aid to regulation of an occupation, profession, or business. The amount of a regulatory fee shall approximate the reasonable cost of the actual regulatory activity performed by the county. A regulatory fee may not include an administrative fee.

                  The occupation tax levied in this article is for revenue purposes only and is not for regulatory purposes, nor is the payment of the tax made a condition precedent to the practice of any such profession, trade, or calling. The occupation tax only applies to those businesses and occupations which are covered by the provisions of O.C.G.A. § 48-13-5 et seq.

Upon payment of the tax and compliance with this article, an occupation tax certificate, also known as a business license, shall be issued. The taxpayer shall display it; in a conspicuous place in the place of business, if the taxpayer has a permanent business location in the county. If the taxpayer has no permanent business location in the county, such business license shall be shown to the community development director, other designee of the county, or to any law enforcement officer of the county upon request.

The number of employees of the business or practitioner shall be computed on a full-time position basis or full-time position equivalent basis, provided that for the purposes of this computation an employee who works 40 hours or more weekly shall be considered a full-time employee and that the average weekly hours of employees who work less than 40 hours shall be added and such sum shall be divided by 40 to produce full-time position equivalents. The tax rate determined by number of employees for each business, trade, profession, or occupation is as follows and will be developed and updated from time to time by the board of commissioners:

The lien of such occupation tax and fee shall become fixed on and date from the time when such tax and fee becomes delinquent. The execution shall be levied by the community development director or other designee of the county upon the property of defendant located in such jurisdiction, and sufficient property shall be advertised and sold to pay the amount of such execution, with interest and costs. All other proceedings in relation thereto shall be had as is provided by the ordinances of the county and the laws of the state, and the defendant taxpayer in such execution shall have rights of defense, by affidavit of illegality and otherwise, which are provided by the applicable laws in regard to tax executions.

                  ARTICLE III. - UNLAWFUL LITTERING RELATING TO STORMWATER AND OTHER SUCH ACTIVITIES 

                  Sec. 40-50. - Preface. 
                  Litter found throughout our community often finds its way into our streams, rivers and lakes and detracts from our quality of life. Pollutants carried into our streams, rivers, and lakes by litter, diminish the quality of our water and its aquatic resources. Litter control ordinances provide a prohibition against littering and provide an enforcement mechanism with penalties for dealing with those found littering. 
                  This article is modeled on the "Georgia Litter Control Law" (O.C.G.A. § 16-7-40 et. seq.) and adoption of this article is authorized by O.C.G.A. § 16-7-48.

The requirements of this article should be considered minimum requirements, and where any provision of this article imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule or regulation, or other provision of law, whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall be considered to take precedence. 
                  (d)  Severability. If the provisions of any article, section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this article shall be judged invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such order of judgment shall not affect or invalidate the remainder of any article, section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this article.

                  The board of commissioners finds that the collection of ad valorem taxes on manufactured homes as defined by O.C.G.A. § 8-2-131, poses special problems and that in order to enable proper identification of the manufactured home and to collect ad valorem taxes thereon it is necessary to require certain permits therefor.

                  ARTICLE V. - ILLICIT DISCHARGE AND ILLEGAL CONNECTION ORDINANCE 

                  Sec. 46-80. - Introduction and overview. 
                  (a)  General purpose. An illicit discharge is defined as any discharge to a municipal or county separate storm sewer system (stormwater drainage system) that is not composed entirely of stormwater runoff (except for discharges allowed under an NPDES permit or nonpolluting flows). These nonstormwater discharges occur due to illegal dumping or illegal connections to the stormwater drainage system. This model ordinance provides communities with the authority to deal with illicit discharges and establishes enforcement actions for those persons or entities found to be in noncompliance or that refuse to allow access to their facilities. 
                  (b)  Overview. It is hereby determined that: 
                  1.  Discharges to the county separate storm sewer system that are not composed entirely of stormwater runoff contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters; 
                  2.  These nonstormwater discharges occur due to spills, dumping and improper connections to the Paulding Separate Storm Sewer System from residential, industrial, commercial or institutional establishments. 
                  3.  These nonstormwater discharges not only impact waterways individually, but geographically dispersed, small volume nonstormwater discharges can have cumulative impacts on receiving waters. 
                  4.  The impacts of these discharges adversely affect public health and safety, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters; 
                  5.  These impacts can be minimized through the regulation of spills, dumping and discharges into the county separate storm sewer system; 
                  6.  Localities in the State of Georgia are required to comply with a number of state and federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution due to improper nonstormwater discharges to the county separate storm sewer system. 
                  Therefore, Paulding County, Georgia adopts this article to prohibit such non-stormwater discharges to the county separate storm sewer system. It is determined that the regulation of spills, improper dumping and discharges to the county separate storm sewer system is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety, and the environment. 
                  (Res. No. 05-07, § 1(Exh. A), 3-22-2005) 
                  Sec. 46-81. - General provision. 
                  (a)  Purpose and intent. The purpose of this article is to protect the public health, safety, environment and general welfare through the regulation of nonstormwater discharges to the county separate storm sewer system to the maximum extent practicable as required by federal law. This article establishes methods for controlling the introduction of pollutants into the county separate storm sewer system in order to comply with requirements of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit process. The objectives of this article are to: 
                  (1)  Regulate the contribution of pollutants to the county separate storm sewer system by any person; 
                  (2)  Prohibit illicit discharges and illegal connections to the county separate storm sewer system; 
                  (3)  Prevent nonstormwater discharges, generated as a result of spills, inappropriate dumping or disposal, to the county separate storm sewer system; and, 
                  (4)  To establish legal authority to carry out all inspection, surveillance, monitoring and enforcement procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this article. 
                  (b)  Applicability. The provisions of this article shall apply throughout the unincorporated area of Paulding County. 
                  (c)  Compatibility with other regulations. This article is not intended to modify or repeal any other ordinance, rule, regulation, other provision of law. The requirements of this article are in addition to the requirements of any other ordinance, rule, regulation, or other provision of law, and where any provision of this article imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation, or other provision of law, whichever provision is more restrictive or imposes higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall control. 
                  (d)  Severability. If the provisions of any section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this article shall be adjudged invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such judgment shall not affect or invalidate the remainder of any section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this article. 
                  (e)  Responsibility for administration. Paulding County, Georgia shall administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of this article, by and through its marshal's office.

In the event of an actual or threatened occurrence of a disaster or emergency, which may result in the large-scale loss of life, injury, property damage or destruction or in the major disruption of routine community affairs, business or governmental operations in the county and which is of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant extraordinary assistance by federal, state and local departments and agencies to supplement the efforts of available public and private resources, the chairman of the board of commissioners may declare a local emergency for Paulding County. The form of the declaration shall be similar to that provided in section 58-83. 
                  (b)  Request for state assistance. Consistent with a declaration of local emergency, the chairman may request the governor to provide assistance, provided that the disaster or emergency is beyond the capacity of the county to meet adequately and state assistance is necessary to supplement local efforts to save lives and protect property, public health and safety, or to avert or lessen the threat of a disaster. 
                  (c)  Continuance. The declaration of local emergency shall continue until the chairman finds that emergency conditions no longer exist, at which time, the chairman shall execute and file with the clerk of the board of commissioners a document marking the end of the state of emergency. No state of local emergency shall continue for longer than 30 days, unless renewed by the chair. The board of commissioners may, by resolution, end a state of local emergency at any time.

                  (1)  The Paulding County Emergency Management Agency ("EMA") Director shall have the legal authority to exercise the powers and discharge the duties conferred upon the emergency management agency, including the implementation of the emergency operations plan, coordination of the emergency responses of public and private agencies and organizations, coordination of recovery efforts with state and federal officials, and inspection of emergency or disaster sites. 
                  (2)  In responding and conducting necessary and appropriate investigations, the director or his/her designee is authorized to enter at a reasonable time upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigating and inspecting sites involved with emergency management functions. The director is authorized to execute a right of entry and/or agreement to use property for these purposes on behalf of the county; however, any such document shall be later presented for ratification at a meeting of the board of commissioners. 
                  (3)  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the county who requests entry for purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials. Nor shall any person obstruct, hamper, or interfere with any such representative while that individual is in the process of carrying out his or her official duties. 
                  (b)  Emergency powers. Following a declaration of emergency and during the continuance of such state of emergency, the chairman is authorized to implement local emergency measures to protect life and property or to bring the emergency situation under control. In exercising this authority, the chairman may cause to become effective any of the following sections of this chapter as appropriate: section 58-87 (registration of building and repair services) to become effective if the governor declares a state of emergency; and section 58-88 (closed or restricted areas and curfews). If any of these sections are included in a declaration of local emergency, the same shall be filed in the office of the clerk of the board of commissioners and shall be in effect until the declaration of local emergency has terminated. 
                  (c)  Authority to waive procedures and fees. Pursuant to a declaration of emergency, the board of commissioners is authorized to cause to be effective any portion of section 58-86 of this chapter as appropriate. The implementation of such subsections shall be filed in the office of the clerk of the board of commissioners. 
                  (d)  Additional emergency powers. The chairman of the board of commissioners shall have, and may exercise for such period as the declared emergency exists or continues, the following additional emergency powers:

                  (7)  To utilize public property when necessary to cope with the emergency or disaster or when there is compelling necessity for the protection of lives, health and welfare; and/or the property of citizens; 
                  (8)  To suspend any law, Code provision or regulation prescribing the procedures for conduct of county business, or the orders, rules or regulations of any county agency, if strict compliance with any ordinance, resolution, order, rule or regulation would in any way prevent, hinder or delay necessary action in coping with the emergency or disaster, provided that such suspension shall provide for the minimum deviation from the requirements under the circumstances and further provided that, when practicable, specialists shall be assigned to avoid adverse effects resulting from such suspension; 
                  (9)  To provide benefits to citizens upon execution of an intergovernmental agreement for grants to meet disaster-related necessary expenses or serious needs of individuals or families adversely affected by an emergency or disaster in cases where the individuals or families are unable to meet the expenses or needs from other means, provided that such grants are authorized only when matching state or federal funds are available for such purposes; 
                  (10)  To perform and exercise such other functions, powers and duties as may be deemed necessary to promote and secure the safety and protection of the civilian population, including individuals with household pets and service animals prior to, during and following a major disaster or emergency.

Each day any such entity does business in the unincorporated areas of the county without complying with this ordinance constitutes a separate offense. 
                  (b)  While registration is required, no fee shall be charged for such registration. Registration is nontransferable. The cost of the emergency building permit shall be equal to the cost for a building permit under existing regulations. The permit shall only be authorized for repairs.

                  (Code 1987, § 18-6(e)) 
                  Sec. 66-96. - Specifications generally. 
                  The size, slope, alignment, materials of construction of a building sewer, and the methods to be used in construction shall all conform to the requirements of the building and plumbing code or other applicable rules and regulations of the county. In the absence of code provisions or in amplification thereof, the materials and procedures set forth in appropriate specifications of the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and the Water Pollution Control Federation (WPCF) Manual of Practice No. 9 shall apply. Additionally, the following materials and methods shall apply to building sewers within county supervision: 
                  (1)  The building sewer shall be cast iron soil pipe, ASTM Specification A74, latest revision or equal; ductile iron pipe, American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Specification A21.51, latest revision, or equal or polyvinyl chloride (PVC) sewer pipe, ASTM Specification D3034, latest revision. All joints shall be tight and waterproof. Any part of the building sewer that is located within ten feet of a water service pipe shall be constructed of cast iron soil pipe of ductile iron pipe. Bolted mechanical joints may be required by the director where the sewer is exposed to damage by tree roots. If installed in filled or unstable ground, the building sewer shall be of cast iron soil pipe except that plastic pipe may be acceptable if laid on a suitable concrete bed or cradle as approved by the director. 
                  (2)  The size and slope of the building sewer shall be subject to the approval of the director, but in no event shall the diameter be less than four inches. The slope of such four-inch pipe shall not be less than one-eighth inch per foot. Furthermore, the appropriate requirements of the Occupational Health and Safety Act (OSHA) shall be followed. 
                  (3)  The depth shall be sufficient to afford protection from frost, and the building sewer shall be laid at uniform grade and with straight alignment insofar as possible. Changes in direction shall be made only with properly curved pipe and fittings. Building sewers shall not be placed in the same trench with water service lines. 
                  (4)  An excavation required for the installation of a building sewer shall be open trench work unless otherwise approved by the director. Pipe laying and backfilling shall be performed in accordance with ASTM Specification C12, latest revision, except that no backfill shall be placed until the work has been inspected and approved. 
                  (5)  All joints and connections shall be made gastight and watertight. Push-on joints for cast iron soil pipe shall have neoprene gaskets in accordance with the requirements of ASTM Specification C-564. Push-on joints for ductile iron pipe shall also have neoprene gaskets and be installed according to the manufacturer's recommendations. PVC pipe, joint material shall be of the bell and spigot type, sealed with a rubber "O"-ring gasket having a composition and texture which is resistant to the common ingredients of sewage, industrial wastes (including oils), and groundwater which will endure permanently under the conditions likely to be imposed by this use. Installation of gaskets shall be done in accordance with the pipe manufacturer's instruction using all the necessary materials, lubricants, and equipment recommended by the manufacturer. 
                  (6)  The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall be made at the "Y" branch, if such a branch is available at a suitable location. If the public sewer is 12 inches in diameter or less, and no properly located "Y" branch is available, the county shall, at the owner's expense, cut a neat hole into the public sewer, with entry in the downstream direction at an angle of about 45 degrees, and install a 45-degree elbow with the spigot end cut so as not to extend past the inner surface of the public sewer. The invert of the building sewer at the point of the connection shall be at an elevation of at least one-tenth foot above the invert of the public sewer. A neat and smooth joint shall be made, and the connection made secure and watertight by encasement in concrete. Special fittings may be used for the connection only when approved by the director.

                  Sec. 66-97. - Point of connection to building. 
                  Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the building at an elevation below the basement floor, but above the top of the manhole of the manhole upstream and downstream from the connection. Where such a connection is not possible, the county assumes no responsibility for damage to property from backups in the sewer due to blockages, flooding, collapse of the line or other unavoidable situations. No building sewer shall be laid parallel to or within three feet of any bearing wall which might thereby be weakened. In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such building drain shall be lifted by an approved means and discharged to the building sewer.

                  (4)  "Property owner" or landowner is the party owing the land through which an easement is requested. 
                  (5)  "Public works" shall mean the Paulding County Public Works Department, its director and/or authorized representatives. 
                  (b)  The owner/developer of a subdivision/development which requires sewer in accordance with this division or the county zoning ordinance is responsible for acquiring all easements across private property for the purpose of constructing and installing the required sewer lines for connection to the sewer system. 
                  (c)  In addition, the owner/developer of a subdivision/development which requires sewer in accordance with this division or the county zoning ordinance is also responsible for acquiring the necessary permits, including, but not limited to, encroachment permits, for any county and/or state right-of-way along which such sewer lines shall be placed. 
                  (d)  In the event the owner/developer of a subdivision/development which is required to connect to sewer in accordance with this division, under the county zoning ordinance, or, who otherwise proposes to connect to sewer is unsuccessful in acquiring the easements across private property which are necessary for the installation of sewer for connection, the county, at the discretion of the board of commissioners, may assist the owner/developer in obtaining the sewer line easements, including the use of the power of eminent domain, pursuant to the following procedures: 
                  (1)  Prior to intervention by Paulding County in the easement acquisition, the owner/developer shall first make a minimum of four documented written attempts to acquire the easement. Said offers to property owners must be made in writing, by certified mail, return receipt requested, or must be acknowledged as received by a notarized statement from the property owner. All such offers must be made in good faith illustrating a genuine attempt to acquire the easement through negotiation. Fifteen days shall elapse between the date of the first and second offers and an additional 15 days must elapse between each subsequent written offer. The second of the documented attempts to purchase the property must include obtaining an opinion of fair market value in a written real estate appraisal from a licensed real estate appraiser certified by the State of Georgia of said easement area and offering the fair market value as indicated by the appraisal, to said private property owner. Said real estate appraisal must include a full fair market valuation of the site, including a consequential damages, consequential benefits analysis. 
                  (2)  The owner/developer shall submit the request for county intervention in the acquisition of the easements in writing to the director of water systems in a form substantially like the form as set forth in the County Code of Ordinances section 66-130, accompanied with a nonrefundable $5,000.00 application fee. The owner/developer must also submit a copy of the real estate appraiser's full report of opinion of fair market value of the easement and the documentation, including the certified mail and receipt forms or the notarized acknowledgment forms as to all acquisition attempts. In addition, the owner/developer will submit four plats of survey for each easement wherein intervention is requested, as well as four copies of the preliminary engineering design and specifications of the sewer line and two copies of the sewer profile. 
                  (3)  The owner/developer must also submit an engineering report from an independent engineering firm stating that the proposed easement route is the most feasible route. Said report must contain the supporting data for this conclusion and must be written by a professional engineer licensed in the State of Georgia. At the request of public works, the county may require a meeting with the independent engineer to review his plans and conclusions. 
                  (4)  If deemed necessary by the director of water systems, the owner/developer shall meet with the director of water systems and county attorney or their designees to discuss the request for intervention. The director of water systems, in reviewing the request, may require the owner/developer to size the line to accommodate the public good if the location of the line is such that public connection to the line from outside the owner/developer's project is likely. 
                  (5)  After reviewing the submission, the water system director and/or county attorney may require the owner/developer to continue negotiations with the owner/developer for a further period, to be determined by the county on a case by case basis. In doing so, the water system director and/or county attorney may require the owner/developer to schedule at least one in-person meeting with the easement landowner that must occur prior to any further county involvement and may also require the owner/developer to obtain a second independent land appraisal of the easement area from a different appraiser at the owner/developer's expense. The county attorney may, at his discretion, select the second appraisal firm. The second appraisal shall meet the appraisal requirements set forth above. 
                  (6)  After receipt of the required materials from the owner/developer and completion of any requested items set forth above, the county public works department shall send a letter to the property owners affected notifying them of the owner/developer's request for assistance in the easement acquisition. The letter will include setting a time and location for a negotiation conference between the property owners, the owner/developer and its surveyor and/or engineer, a representative from the public works department and a person designated by the director of the public works department to act as the easement negotiation agent. The county attorney may act as the easement negotiation agent. 
                  (7)  In the event no resolution is reached during the easement conference, the parties shall be required to attend a further mediation regarding the easement. A member of the county staff and/or county attorney are not required to attend the mediation, but may do so if scheduling allows and if so requested. The mediation shall be conducted by one of the licensed mediators on the nondomestic mediators' list for the 7th Judicial Circuit. The mediator shall be selected utilizing the following method: The owner/developer shall select three licensed mediators and present those choices to the property owners. The property owners may select any name from the list of three. Provided however, in the event the parties are unable to reach an agreement as to whom the mediator should be, the county attorney will randomly assign a mediator from the 7th Judicial Circuit list of mediators on a rotating basis. 
                  The parties shall attend mediation and work towards a solution in good faith. The owner/developer shall be responsible for the cost of the mediator's fees and will be responsible for payment at the time of mediation. The mediator shall supply the county attorney with a copy of the mediation report and/or mediation agreement showing the outcome of the mediation. 
                  (8)  In the event no resolution is reached, the director of water systems and the county attorney shall review the results of the mediation and the aspects of the matter further and determine whether any further negotiations should be required. Thereafter, if the water system director and county attorney determine that all privately held mediation and negotiation attempts have failed, the water system director shall present the issue to the water and sewer advisory board for their recommendation regarding whether intervention in the acquisition of the easement is in the best interest of the county at the next available regularly scheduled meeting of the water and sewer advisory board. 
                  The owner/developer and property owners shall both be advised of the date and time of the water and sewer advisory board meeting and provided an opportunity to be heard. The water and sewer advisory board may establish its own rules regarding the length and nature of any such presentations. In making its decision, the water and sewer advisory board shall consider whether there is a compelling public interest in acquiring the easement though county intervention. The water and sewer advisory board may make a determination as follows: (1) that it is not in the county's best interest to move forward with assisting in the easement acquisition process; (2) that it is in the county's best interest to move forward with assisting in the acquisition process; (3) the issue should be tabled to the water and sewer advisory board for further review. The water and sewer advisory board may table the issues to seek further information from any source, to allow the staff more time to review alternate routes, and/or to request the owner/developer and property owner continue further negotiations. In the event the water and sewer advisory board requests further negotiations or information, the owner/developer must provide the information requested to Paulding County Public Works at least one week prior to the scheduled decision meeting and the owner/developer must appear before the water and sewer advisory board at the scheduled meeting to discuss the information and its further attempts at resolution. Thereafter, the water and sewer advisory board, at its discretion, may continue to table an item to a time certain or vote as set forth above. 
                  The water and sewer advisory board may offer any further recommendations it deems appropriate to the board of commissioners. 
                  (9)  After the water and sewer advisory board has issued its recommendation regarding the request, the director of water systems shall place this matter on the agenda and present the issue to the board of commissioners (if the owner/developer desires to proceed with the request) at a future, available board of commissioners' regularly scheduled meeting. The findings and recommendations of the water and sewer advisory board will be presented to the board of commissioners in conjunction with the director of water systems' presentation. In addition, the county attorney shall be available to present to the board of commissioners a report of the previous findings from the easement conferences. 
                  (10)  The board of commissioners will consider the request and vote on the request for intervention in the acquisition of the easement at a public meeting. The owner/developer requesting same and the property owners affected will be notified of the time and place of the meeting in which the request will be considered. In its decision, the board of commissioners shall consider whether there is a compelling public interest in the acquisition of the easement through county intervention. The board of commissioners may vote as follows: (1) to continue assistance in the acquisition of the easement, including instituting an action pursuant to the power of eminent domain to acquire the easement, (2) to continue assistance in the acquisition, but reserve the issue of the use of eminent domain after further discussions between the owner/developer, county and property owner have been completed; (3) to deny the request for assistance from the owner/developer; (4) to table the request for assistance and (5) any other appropriate motion it deems proper. The board of commissioners may table the issue to seek further information from any source, to allow the staff more time to review alternate routes and/or to request the owner/developer and property owner continue further negotiations. Thereafter, the board of commissioners, at its discretion, may continue to table the request to a time certain or vote as set forth above. 
                  (11)  The final decision to intervene and assist in easement acquisition is at the sole discretion of the board of commissioners. Nothing in this section shall be construed as to give the owner/developer a property interest or right to the county's assistance in the easement acquisition process nor shall it give any such right to a time frame or schedule for assistance at any stage of the process. 
                  (12)  Should any discrepancy exist between the terms contained in subsection (a)(1) entitled "connection to county sewer", and the county development regulations, the terms of this section shall control. 
                  (e)  In addition to the application fee, the developer submitting the request for easement acquisition assistance shall be responsible for the payment of the following costs and expenses: 
                  (1)  The cost of acquisition of the rights in and to the easement from the landowner as may be agreed upon by the parties or as may be determined by judgment from a court of competent jurisdiction; 
                  (2)  Any and all attorney's fees and expenses resulting from the negotiation, mediation and or any other such attorney services conducted by the county attorney or their representative with regard to the easement acquisition; 
                  (3)  Attorneys' fees and expenses in an amount equal to the amount paid by Paulding County to attorneys selected by Paulding County to prosecute the easement acquisition to final judgment; 
                  (4)  The costs associated with any appraisals that are produced in conjunction with the easement request; 
                  (5)  Fees and expenses paid to any expert witness used by the attorneys in the easement acquisition process; 
                  (6)  The costs of any sewer or water tap fees offered and provided to property owners or third parties in connection with or exchange of any easements. 
                  (7)  Court fees including, but not limited to, filing fees, service fees, court reporter fees, special master fees, mediator fees or attorney's fees as may be assessed by a court; 
                  (8)  Such other and further fees, costs and expenses as may be reasonably incurred by Paulding County in the easement acquisition process. 
                  All such fees must be paid promptly within 30 days of an invoice for said fees being presented to owner/developer. All checks must be made payable to the Paulding County Board of Commissioners, except those paid as judgments or costs of land acquisition, which may be paid directly to the property owner. 
                  In the event payment is not received by Paulding County promptly, Paulding County is authorized to bring an action for collection of the fees against the owner/developer in a court of competent jurisdiction and may collect damages for the action, including attorney's fees.

                  Sec. 67-1. - General provisions. 
                  This chapter shall hereafter be known and cited as the "Paulding County Sign Ordinance." 
                  (Res. No. 17-37, § 4 (Exh. A), 11-14-2017) 
                  Sec. 67-2. - Jurisdiction. 
                  The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all signs erected within the unincorporated area of Paulding County, Georgia. 
                  (Res. No. 17-37, § 4 (Exh. A), 11-14-2017) 
                  Sec. 67-3. - Purpose and findings. 
                  (a)  Purpose. This chapter is enacted with the following purposes: 
                  (1)  To protect the rights of individuals and businesses to convey their messages through signs; 
                  (2)  To encourage the effective use of signs as means of communication; 
                  (3)  To promote economic development; 
                  (4)  To improve traffic and pedestrian safety as it may be affected by distracting signs; 
                  (5)  To prevent the destruction of the natural beauty and environment of the county; 
                  (6)  To protect the public health, safety, and general welfare; 
                  (7)  To restrict the continued existence of abandoned or nonconforming signs unless in compliance with the terms of this chapter to eliminate, over time, all nonconforming signs; 
                  (8)  To ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign standards; and 
                  (9)  To provide an easier, quicker and more economically efficient way to apply for a sign review application. 
                  (b)  Findings. 
                  (1)  Paulding County finds that signs are a proper use of private property, are a means of personal free expression and a necessary component of a commercial environment. As such, signs are entitled to the protection of the law. In the absence of regulation, however, the number of such signs tends to proliferate, with property owners desiring ever increasing numbers and sizes of signs, leading to cluttered and aesthetically blighted thoroughfares. In addition, the competition among competing sign owners for visibility of their signs contributes to safety hazards for both vehicles and pedestrians and can undermine the sign owners' original purpose of presenting a clear message of their idea or identification of their premises. 
                  (2)  Unsafe, cluttered and aesthetically blighted thoroughfares are a potential problem throughout the county. The county finds it imperative that signs along its corridor be within the driver's vision while attending to traffic so as to distract drivers for the minimal length of time. In addition to height limits, the competing interests requiring signage on county thoroughfares necessitate appropriate size limitation that will support visibility of all signs, not just a favored few. It is within the power of the legislature to determine that the community should be beautiful as well as healthy, spacious as well as clean, well balanced as well as carefully controlled (Berman v. Parker, 348 U.S. 26, 75 S. Ct. 98, 99 L. Ed. 27 1954). 
                  (3)  Regulation of the size, height, number and spacing of signs throughout the county is necessary to protect the public safety, to assure compatibility of signs with surrounding land uses, to enhance the business and economy of the county to protect the public investment in the streets and highways, to maintain the tranquil environment of residential areas, to promote industry and commerce, to eliminate visual clutter and blights, to provide and aesthetically appealing environment, and to provide for the orderly and reasonable display of advertising for the benefit of all the county's citizens. 
                  (4)  The county further finds that there is a substantial difference between signs erected by public authority and signs erected by private citizens or businesses. Signs erected by public authority are virtually all erected for the purpose of maintaining the public safety either through direct control of traffic or through provision of such type signage as street signs which enable the traveling public to know where they are located and to find where they are going. As such, virtually all government signs are erected purely for public safety purposes. The county finds that public utility signs are frequently of the same nature as those signs erected by governmental entities in that they provide necessary information to safeguard the public from downed power lines and from street excavations. Unregulated signage can degrade the utility of public signs. 
                  (5)  The county finds that some signage has a single targeted function and that identification of such signage by description is impossible without referring to its function. For instance, address numerals are used for the sole purpose of locating addresses, which is of benefit to persons looking for those addresses and is essential to public safety personnel responding to emergencies. Which such signage is referenced based upon the function is serves within the context of this chapter, the bulk of the provisions of this chapter are unrelated to the content of the speech provided and allow maximum expressive potential to sign owners. 
                  (6)  The county finds that advances in technology utilizing LED components results in signs much brighter in appearance for LED signs than for signs not utilizing LED technology. Studies who, particularly during non-daylight hours, that attention given by drivers to such signs is measurably longer than attention to non-LED signs. These findings have been reported by such diverse agencies as the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute in its March 22, 2007 report on Driving Performance and Digital Billboards and the Wisconsin Department of Transportation in its December 1994 Milwaukee County Stadium Variable Message Sign Study. As a result of these and other studies, the county has determined that use of LED technology on outdoor signage in the county along thoroughfares of various categories is detrimental to the public safety. 
                  (7)  This chapter is adopted to serve substantial governmental interests of correcting and avoiding multiple problems that would occur without the regulation of signs. The regulations contained herein are no more extensive than necessary to serve the substantial governmental interests identified in this chapter. It is not the intent of this chapter to apply regulation to signs based upon the message that they convey. It is not the intent of this chapter to foreclose important and distinct mediums of expression for political, religious or personal messages. Furthermore, it is not the intent of the county, nor any of its boards, commissions, or agents, to regulate, in any manner, the message content of signs, expect to the extent of obscenity or other messages prohibited by state or federal law. 
                  (8)  This chapter shall be a separate and distinct ordinance and not a part of the zoning ordinance. 
                  (9)  Categories for zoning and land use as related to sign locations in section 67-25 of this chapter are defined by the zoning categories set forth in the Paulding County Zoning Ordinance.

                  Sec. 67-22. - Measurement of sign area. 
                  (a)  Size generally. The areas of a sign shall be computed as the area within the smallest continuous polygon comprised of not more than eight straight lines enclosing the limits of a sign face, together with any sign face cabinet or frame or material, texture, or color forming an integral part of the sign face used to differentiate the sign face from the structure upon which it is placed. If polygons established around wall signs located on the same street oriented wall are within 24 inches or less of one another, then the area of the sign shall be measured within one continuous polygon. 
                  (b)  Structure. The computation of the area of a sign face shall not include the structure, supports, or uprights on which the sign face is placed or any portions of a sign structure that are not intended to contain any message or idea and are purely structural or decorative in nature, other than those parts contained within the polygon that delimits the sign face. 
                  (c)  Electronic sign/changeable copy sign. For any signs on which the words, letters, figures, symbols, logos, fixtures, colors, or other design elements routinely change or are intended to be changed from time to time, the sign face area shall include the entire area within which any words, letters, figures, symbols, logos, fixtures, colors, or other design elements may be placed, together with any frame or material, texture or coloring forming an integral part of the sign face or used to differentiate the sign face from the structure upon which it is placed. Such changeable copy signs cannot flash, and if located within 150 feet of a road right-of-way, may not change more than one time per 20 seconds. The changeable copy portion of an allowed sign shall not exceed 75 percent of the overall sign area. Changeable copy displays shall remain constant in lighting, color, and all other changeable variables allowed by technology. 
                  (d)  Multi-faced signs. For multi-faced signs, when the sign face surfaces are back to back, or where the interior angle formed by the faces is 45 degrees or less, the area of the sign shall be taken as the areas on the largest side. For all other multi-faced signs, the area of the sign shall be the total area on all sides that can be viewed at one time from any angle. 
                  (Res. No. 17-37, § 4 (Exh. A), 11-14-2017) 
                  Sec. 67-23. - Measurement of sign height. 
                  The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the base of the sign structure at normal grade to the top of the highest attached component of the sign. Normal grade shall be construed to be the lower of: 
                  (1)  Existing grade prior to construction; or 
                  (2)  The newly established grade after construction, exclusive of any filling, berming, mounding, or excavating solely for the purpose of locating the sign. In cases in which the normal grade cannot reasonably be determined, sign height shall be computed on the assumption that the elevation of the normal grade at the base of the sign is equal to the elevation of the nearest point of the crown of a public street or the grade of the land at the principal entrance to the principal structure on the zone lot, whichever is greater. Where the normal grade is below the normal grade of a public street, the sign base can be raised to the elevation of the normal grade of the street before the height limitations are applied. (A surveyor's elevation certificate is required.)

                  (a)  Building codes. All signs permitted under this Code shall be constructed and maintained in accordance with the applicable county building codes. The county may remove after notice pursuant to section 67-18 any sign which shows neglect or becomes dilapidated. 
                  (b)  Faces. The face of sign shall be flat, with protrusions of no more than two inches to allow for the texture of the sign and words, letters, figures, symbols, logos, fixtures, colors, or other design elements. No sign or other advertising structure shall be constructed so as to have nails, tacks, or wires protruding therefrom. 
                  (c)  Illumination. Signs, when illumination is permitted, may be illuminated internally or externally. 
                  (d)  Landscaping. Landscaping and grass shall be maintained in front of, behind, underneath, and around the base of monument signs.

                  (1)  Where a zoning district boundary line is shown as approximately following a corporate limits line, a militia district line, a land lot line, a lot line, or the center line of a street, a county road, a state highway, an interstate highway, or a railroad right-of-way or such lines extended, then such lines shall be construed to be the zoning district boundary lines. 
                  (2)  Where a zoning district boundary line is shown as being set back from a street, a county road, a state highway, an interstate highway, or a railroad right-of-way, and approximately parallel thereto, then such zoning district boundary line shall be construed as being at the scaled distance from the center line of the street, county road, state highway, interstate highway, or railroad right-of-way and as being parallel thereto.

                  Sec. E. - Comprehensive future land use map distinguished from zoning. 
                  The comprehensive future land use map is a guide and is not binding; it does not alter or affect the existing zoning districts in the county, does not effectuate an amendment to the official zoning map, and does not itself permit or prohibit any existing land uses.

                  (1)  Objective . The objective of providing buffers and landscaped areas for screening between dissimilar districts is to protect and preserve the appearance, character, and value of adjacent land uses. 
                  (2)  Definitions . 
                  (a)  Buffer: A barrier which is created by the use of evergreen trees or other acceptable plant or vegetative material alone or in combination with berms, fencing, or walls used to physically separate or screen one use or property from another so as to visually shield or block noise, lights, or dissimilar uses. 
                  (b)  Natural/undisturbed Buffer: An existing natural barrier which contains a stand of evergreen trees or other acceptable vegetative material with a density or intensity which meets the intent of the definition of buffer. 
                  (c)  Planted/landscaped buffer: A planted natural barrier which contains a stand of evergreen trees or other acceptable vegetative material with a density or intensity which meets the intent of the definition of buffer. 
                  (3)  Buffer requirements. The buffer area may be included within the required setbacks; however, in such case that the required buffer is greater than the required setback, the required buffer shall be adhered to. Buffers are required to be installed on properties adjacent to dissimilar districts in accordance with the following specifications: 
                  Minimum Buffer Width Requirements (1) 

                  (1) Note: reference paragraph (6) herein for required buffer area along stream banks, water ways, or watercourses. 
                  *Must provide buffer area for subdivision developments. 
                  (4)  Standards . Buffers are subject to review and approval by county planning staff. The landscaping policies and standards listed in this section are the minimum policies and standards for buffers. The following are required standards for buffers and shall be used by the county planning staff in reviewing development applications. 
                  (a)  Buffers shall be designated on the site plan as a permanent buffer strip. 
                  (b)  Buffers shall be natural/undisturbed areas of existing mature trees which meet the intent of the definition of buffer. Where substantially devoid of existing trees, or where it is necessary to disturb the existing natural/undisturbed area, a planted/landscaped buffer shall be established in accordance with this section. 
                  (c)  Buffers shall be established and maintained along required adjoining property to meet the minimum width requirements for dissimilar districts as shown in the above table. 
                  (d)  Buffers shall be of such nature and density at species maturity to screen activities and uses on the lot from view from the normal level of a first story window on an abutting lot. Buffers shall not be closer than 15 feet to the street right-of-way unless approved by county planning staff. 
                  (e)  Buffers shall provide year-round visual screening from the ground to a height of at least six feet. 
                  (f)  Buffers that utilize trees and/or other vegetation shall be installed not only to provide visual screening but to allow for proper plant growth and maintenance. 
                  (g)  Buffer design shall be integrated with the overall design concept for the project. 
                  (h)  Existing tree cover and natural vegetation shall be undisturbed except for the addition of supplemental plantings or other approved screening devices, or for the provision of required access or utility crossings as approved by the county planning staff. Where a buffer is substantially devoid of trees or shrubbery, grading may be allowed within the buffer area prior to replanting or the provision of other screening devices as required. 
                  (i)  Said buffer areas may not be used for any parking or for the erection of any permanent structure thereon except a fence. 
                  (j)  No artificial plants, trees, or other artificial vegetation shall be installed. 
                  (k)  All existing, healthy deciduous and hardwood trees with a caliper of five or more inches at a point four and one-half feet above the natural grade shall be retained, whenever feasible; if not feasible the tree shall be replaced with the same or similar type of tree in accordance with the intent of paragraph (1) below. 
                  (l)  All planted trees shall be native to this region and, when planted, such replacement tree shall be a minimum height of six feet and be a species which will reach at least 20 feet in height at maturity or shall be a flowering tree with a minimum height of six feet at time of planting. All plantings shall be in staggered rows, with vegetation spaced a minimum of ten feet apart (measured trunk to truck) with a minimum of two staggered rows of plantings for every ten feet of buffer width. The following are approved for such plantings, but shall not be exclusive of other vegetation which may be suitable as approved by the county planning staff, provided they form a visible screen: Leyland Cypress, Bufordi Holly (Dwarf Holly), Ilex Opaca (Savannah Holly), Ilex Chinese (Nellie R. Stevens Holly), Pinus Strobus (White Pine), Magnolia Gradiflora (Southern Magnolia), Cleara Japonica, Green Ash, Mountain Laurel, Black Gum, Hop Horneam, Oak Species (Scarlet, Southern Red, Swamp Chestnut, Sawtooth, Chestnut), Linden or Basswood, Viburnum.

                  (Res. No. 07-47, §§ 1, 2, 11-13-2007) 
                  Sec. I. - OSRD open space residential development. 
                  The open space residential development district (OSRD) promotes development strategies for large tracts of land that can help communities preserve open space and natural areas in residential housing developments. The OSRD strategically allows the clustering of houses and structures on less environmentally sensitive areas, which in-turn preserves groundwater, floodplains, wetlands, streams, steep slopes, woodlands and wildlife habitat. The clustering of houses and structures also reduces the amount of infrastructure required to serve the development and lessens potential erosion and sedimentation impacts. The OSRD promotes interconnected greenways and corridors throughout the development and supports contiguous greenspace with adjacent communities. Walking trails, bike paths, public gathering places, use of parks and community facilities, as focal points are requirements of an OSRD. Other OSRD standards to promote coherent aesthetics within the community include landscaping requirements, underground utilities, recreational amenities, streetlights, sidewalks, and primary building setbacks. In addition, plans for OSRD approval by the governing authority shall require the provision of a public sewage disposal system as approved by county and state authorities. 
                  An open space residential development district must consist of a minimum of 50 contiguous acres of land with at least 40 percent of the total area designated for open space. Individual lot and dwelling sizes are to be approved when specific plans are submitted to the governing authority, with the provision that the maximum number of dwelling units per gross acre in an OSRD shall not exceed 3.0 units. This allows for a more efficient lot layout in respect to the natural features of the property. 
                  (1)  Purpose. The open space residential development district is a residential district that provides for the proper development of larger tracts of land in a coordinated, well planned manner. The features of this district include the following: 
                  (a)  To provide for the preservation of greenspace as a nonstructural stormwater runoff and watershed protection measure. 
                  (b)  To provide a residential zoning district that permits flexibility of design in order to promote environmentally sensitive and efficient uses of the land. 
                  (c)  To preserve in perpetuity unique or sensitive natural resources such as groundwater, floodplains, wetlands, streams, steep slopes, woodlands and wildlife habitat. 
                  (d)  To permit clustering of houses and structures on less environmentally sensitive soils which will reduce the amount of infrastructure, including paved surfaces and utility easements, necessary for residential development. 
                  (e)  To reduce erosion and sedimentation by minimizing land disturbance and removal of vegetation in residential development. 
                  (f)  To promote interconnected greenways and corridors throughout the community. 
                  (g)  To promote contiguous greenspace with adjacent jurisdictions. 
                  (h)  To encourage interaction in the community by clustering houses and orienting them closer to the street, providing public gathering places and encouraging use of parks and community facilities as focal points in the neighborhood. 
                  (i)  To encourage street designs that reduce traffic speeds and reliance on main arteries. 
                  (j)  To promote construction of convenient landscaped walking trails and bike paths both within the subdivision and connected to neighboring communities, businesses, and facilities to reduce reliance on automobiles. 
                  (k)  To conserve scenic views and reduce perceived density by maximizing the number of houses with direct access to and views of open space. 
                  (l)  To preserve important historic and archaeological sites. 
                  (2)  Guidelines for review. The review of the open space residential development district shall consider the following general intentions, objectives, and purpose prior to approval by the governing authority: 
                  (a)  Whether the development will be compatible with the topography, hydrology, and other natural features of the land, and whether any unusual topographic or other natural features will be affected. 
                  (b)  Whether the character, design, and layout of the proposed uses will be adequate and appropriate to encourage a desirable living environment. 
                  (c)  Whether the development will adversely affect any adjacent properties. 
                  (d)  Whether the development will be able to preserve the natural amenities of streams, wooded areas, wetlands, and other similar features. 
                  (e)  Whether the existing and or proposed streets, utilities, and other public services are adequate to serve the development. 
                  (f)  Whether protective deed covenants are established to provide for the perpetual maintenance, security, and the continuation of dedicated area. 
                  (3)  Types of permitted uses. The open space residential development district is a planned district that permits uses that are primarily residential in character and shall consist of single-family detached dwelling units with customary home occupations and appropriate accessory uses and structures, and limited recreational uses, as approved by the governing authority. Churches, schools, and limited day-care facilities planned as part of the OSRD, at its application inception, are also allowed; provided however, that such uses, if introduced as a part of the OSRD development after the OSRD development has been reviewed and approved by the governing authority, shall require review and approval by the governing authority through a subsequent amended application process. 
                  (4)  Minimum site area. The minimum site area shall be restricted to no less than 50 contiguous acres developed under one coordinated plan. 
                  (5)  Gross density. The maximum number of dwelling units per gross acre in an OSRD shall not exceed 3.0 units. 
                  (6)  Ownership of development site. The tract of land to be subdivided may be held in single and separate ownership or in multiple ownership. If held in multiple ownership, however, the site shall be developed according to a single plan with common authority and common responsibility. 
                  (7)  Application for approval of an open space residential development. An application for an open space residential development shall be submitted on forms provided by the planning and zoning division as provided for in this ordinance, and shall be advertised in the same manner as applications for rezoning. Public hearings will be held in the same manner as applications for rezoning are conducted. All applications shall be accompanied by an application fee as established by the board of commissioners. 
                  The application shall be supported by a written statement of intent and a site development plan. At the time of construction, a more detailed site development plan shall be provided consistent with plan review standards established by the county.

                  a.  Criteria. Unless otherwise exempt from the provisions of this subsection, any use or development shall be required to plant and maintain the type of landscape buffer required herein between that use or development and the adjacent properties. In order to determine the type of landscape buffer required for a particular use or development, the two tables below, which provide the landscape buffering standards applicable within the PAMOD district, must be utilized. "N/A" shall indicate that no landscape buffer is required. 

                   
                  Note: For residential uses refer to the Paulding County Zoning Ordinance (Article VI Sec. E.) buffer standards. Buffers shall be designed to encourage interconnectivity to the maximum extent possible. Landscape buffers shall be designed to encourage tree groupings adjacent to loading areas to promote vegetative screening. 
                  Buffer Types (Per 100 Linear Feet) 

                   
                  Where a Type A buffer is required to separate a proposed use from an existing use of equal or greater intensity, the minimum width shall be ten feet. A ROW shall not be considered an existing use of equal or greater intensity. Clustering of vegetation is encouraged in these areas to provide for property interconnects, access drives, and other similar uses. 
                  Exceptions. Use or development of individual lots within a platted subdivision will be required to meet the buffer standards of the zoning ordinance for the zoning category. The community development department director or his/her designee may reduce and/or eliminate the buffer requirement through an administrative variance as long as the adjoining property owner has agreed with the buffer reduction or elimination in writing. 
                  (8)  Structure heights. Heights of structures shall be limited to 60 feet, except that an additional foot of height will be allowed provided an additional two feet of building setback is provided for every additional foot of height to a maximum of 90 feet. It is recognized that uses that may be desirable for the district may require heights in excess of 90 feet; therefore, additional building height may be granted through the zoning board of appeals per variance application. Note that building and structure heights are also regulated by the Airport Overlay District and the FAA. Residential base zoning districts are subject to the established height restrictions per the zoning ordinance. 
                  (9)  Project entryways. The provisions contained in this subsection apply to developments in categories CR, 0, I, D and A.

                  a.  Design intent/objective. Each development typically adopts a design style and modifies it to its own particular needs. A development's appearance must be considered in terms of basic massing, shape and character versus an attempt to mimic a particular style's commonly perceived details and ornaments. Design elements throughout a development must be consistent with the nature of the chosen style and building materials selected. Building design should endeavor to adhere to the classical principles of design and avoid clichés, overly complex or garish motifs, while seeking to invoke a "timeless" quality. Green Building design is also an important aspect to the overall building scheme. Leed Green Building standards may be applied. 
                  b.  Criteria. All primary facades of a building shall be consistent in architectural detailing with respect to architectural design treatments. 
                  (30)  Building massing and form. The provisions contained in this subsection apply to developments in categories CR, I, D, 0, and A. 
                  a.  Design intent/objective. To enhance the attractiveness of the streetscape and the built environment of the PAMOD district. Buildings shall have design features and patterns that provide visual interest at the scale of the pedestrian and the motorist; reduce massing aesthetic, and be site responsive. Facades shall be articulated to reduce the mass/scale and uniform monolithic appearance of large unadorned walls when in view of the general public, while providing visual interest that will be consistent with the district's vision. Articulation is accomplished by varying the building's mass in height and width so that it appears to be divided into distinct massing elements and details that can be perceived at the scale of the pedestrian and the motorist entering the site. Building massing shall possess a balance in form and composition. Large, flat, non-articulated building elevations or long undifferentiated walls are not permitted. 
                  b.  Criteria. Exterior facades shall comply with the following standards: 
                  • No horizontal length or uninterrupted curve of a building facade shall exceed 100 linear feet. For buildings with arcades, no horizontal length or uninterrupted curve of a building facade shall exceed 120 feet, varied lengths are desirable. Projections and recesses shall have a minimum depth of three feet with 25 percent of these having a varied length with a minimum differential of one foot. 
                  • Exterior wall planes shall not constitute more than 50 percent of each affected ground floor facade. The wall plane shall be measured at one foot off the exterior wall surface on each side of the wall. 
                  • Primary facades on the ground floor shall have features along a minimum of 50 percent of their horizontal length per affected side and may include: arcades, minimum of eight feet clear in width; display windows; entry areas; or other such devices. Awnings are excluded from this calculation unless associated with windows/doors and are in increments of ten feet or less. 
                  These requirements are only required when the building is within 500 feet of a road ROW. 
                  Airport service function areas shall be exempt from this provision. 
                  Metal, stucco, efis are only allowed as accent material and requires planning and zoning division approval. 
                  (31)  Building entrances. The provisions contained in this subsection apply to developments in categories CR, I, D, 0, and A. 
                  a.  Design intent/objective. To ensure that a structure's design clearly indicates the primary building entrance. Primary building entrances should be obvious. A clearly defined primary pedestrian entry linking to an enhanced hardscaped foreground is required for each building. Entrances are to be integrated into a comprehensive design style for the development. Entryway design elements and variations are intended to give orientation and protection from the elements. 
                  b.  Building orientation. The principal public entrance shall face the primary collector or arterial street when the property is situated along a road ROW. Additional entrances and windows adjacent to additional abutting rights-of-way or adjacent buildings are encouraged. 
                  c.  Consistency. Design features used to emphasize building entrances require integration into the overall building design. Elements that appear "tacked on" will not be approved. A tacked on element shall be defined as an element without a minimum dimension of two feet from the adjacent facade. 
                  d.  Configuration. A relationship between the site and each building shall be firmly established. Site features that create a link to the building and develop a sense of place must be integrated into every development. Appropriate examples include: 
                  • Entry areas differentiated by enhanced hardscape areas, framed by special planters and plantings, trellised entry courts, and/or architectural building forms. 
                  • Recesses and overhands appropriate to the specifics of the site. 
                  • Clear linkage to the pedestrian sidewalk system is required. 
                  Inappropriate examples include: 
                  • A primary building entry served solely by a narrow sidewalk that can only be reached by walking between a row of parked cars. 
                  • A primary building entry as a non-recessed doorway within a glass wall. 
                  • An entry into which a narrow walkway abruptly dead-ends. 
                  (32)  Building materials and colors. The provisions contained in this subsection apply to developments in categories CR, I, D, 0, and A, and as otherwise noted. 
                  a.  Design intent/objective. To provide aesthetically pleasing building exteriors. Colors and materials can contribute significantly to the visual impact of a building in either a positive or negative way. Material and colors shall be well designed and integrated into a comprehensive design style for the building. Exterior materials selected for a building should be consistently applied or linked throughout a specific development including auxiliary structures. 
                  b.  Exterior building materials standards. The provisions contained in this subsection apply to exterior building materials standards for developments in categories CR, I, D, 0, and A. 
                  (i)  Predominant exterior building materials shall include, but are not limited to: 
                  • Brick;

                  • Vinyl as an accent only per planning and zoning division approval; 
                  • Wood (wood exterior components must have planning and zoning approval); 
                  • Stone; and 
                  • Tilt up walls. 
                  (ii)  Predominant exterior building materials that are prohibited include: 
                  • Plastic siding; 
                  • Wall tile; 
                  • Metal 
                  • Smooth or rib faced concrete block; and 
                  • GLASS BOXES: Monolithic glazing may be used in special applications, but should be avoided as a singular design theme. Nonarticulated "Glass Box" designs will not be allowed. 
                  (iii)  Metal airport buildings, hangars and accessory structures as allowed only with approval of the airport authority. 
                  c.  Predominant exterior colors. The provisions contained in this subsection apply to predominant exterior colors for developments in categories CR, I, D, 0, and A. 
                  (i)  Design intent/objective. Building colors should reflect or complement the natural background environment. Colors should blend, rather than clash, with this natural setting.

                  (Res. No. 08-25, § 1(Exh. A), 9-23-2008; Res. No. 10-07, § 6, 5-25-2010) 
                  Sec. U. - Paulding County Airport Overlay District. 
                  Purpose and intent. The purpose and intent of the Paulding County Airport Overlay District is to reduce the potential for airport hazards, based on the following findings: 
                  1.  An airport hazard endangers the lives and property of users of landing fields and property or occupants in the vicinity of landing fields within Paulding County. 
                  2.  An airport hazard of the obstructive nature in effect reduces the size of the area available for the landing, takeoff, and maneuvering of aircraft, thus tending to destroy or impair the utility of an airport and the public investment therein. 
                  3.  The creation or establishment of an airport hazard is a public nuisance and detrimental to the region served by the airport affected. 
                  4.  It is necessary to prevent the creation or establishment of airport hazards in order to protect the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to promote the most appropriate use of land. 
                  In order to carry out the purpose and intent of the Paulding County Airport Overlay District, the following development standards shall apply to the described conical areas, approach areas and accident potential zones indicated on the official Paulding County Zoning Map. 
                  The following subsections provide additional specific detail concerning safe airport operations and use of surrounding properties. 
                  Applicability. The Paulding County Airport Overlay District applies to the Paulding County Airport in Paulding County, Georgia. 
                  Airspace and accident potential areas. In order to carry out the purpose and intent of the Paulding County Airport Overlay District as set forth above, and to restrict those uses which may be hazardous to the operational safety of aircraft operating to and from airports within Paulding County, the following air space and land use safety areas are established. 
                  1.  Conical Area (CA): The conical area is all that land which lies directly under an imaginary three-dimensional surface (the conical surface) extending outward from the primary surface at an elevation of 35 feet above the elevation of the centerline of the runway for a distance of 3,500 feet. The conical surface continues upward and outward at a slope of one vertical foot for every 100 horizontal feet for a horizontal distance of 30,000 feet as measured radially outward from the edge of the primary surface. 
                  2.  Approach Area (AA): The approach area is all that land which lies directly under an imaginary trapezoid-shaped approach surface longitudinally centered on the extended centerline at each end of a runway. The inner edge of the approach surface is the same width and elevation as the end of the primary surface. The approach area extends outward from the ends of the primary surface a minimum of 10,000 feet. 
                  a.  For those runways 10,000 feet or less in length the approach area expands uniformly to a width of: 
                  i.  Four thousand feet for existing or planned precision instrument runways or nonprecision instrument runways having visibility minimums as low as ¾ of a statute mile. 
                  ii.  Three thousand five hundred feet for existing or planned nonprecision instrument runways having visibility minimums greater than ¾ of a statute mile. 
                  iii.  Two thousand five hundred feet for existing or planned visual runways other than utility. 
                  iv.  Two thousand two hundred fifty feet for existing or planned visual utility runways. 
                  3.  Accident Potential Zone A (APZ-"A"): Accident Potential Zone "A" is all land in that portion of the approach area of the runway as defined hereinabove which extends outward from the end of the primary surface a distance equal to 1/3 of the existing or planned length of the runway. 
                  4.  Accident Potential Zone B (APZ-"B"): Accident Potential Zone "B" is all land in that portion of the approach area of a runway as defined hereinabove which extends outward from Accident Potential Zone "A" a distance equal to ⅔ of the existing or planned length of the runway. 
                  General use restrictions. 
                  1.  No use shall be made of any land in the conical area defined hereinabove that would cause any one of the following circumstances. 
                  a.  The use creates or causes interference with the operations of radio or electronic facilities at the airport or with radio or electronic communications between airport and aircraft. 
                  b.  The use makes it difficult for pilots to distinguish between airport lights and other lights. 
                  c.  The use results in glare in the eyes of pilots using the airports. 
                  d.  The use impairs visibility in the vicinity of the airport. 
                  e.  The use endangers the landing, taking off, or maneuvering of aircraft. 
                  f.  The use creates a bird attractant that, in the opinion of the airport, could interfere with aircraft operations. 
                  2.  The following restrictions also apply: 
                  a.  Paulding County Airport: Prior to development or issuance of a building permit in any of the airspace and/or Accident Potential Areas defined herein, the awarding of an avigation easement by the property owner(s) to the appropriate airport(s) shall be required and recorded with the Paulding County Clerk of Court's Office. 
                  b.  In all cases, the filing of an FAA Form 7460-1 with the FAA Southeast Region may also be required by the airport(s), based on the overall height, location, and/or nature of the proposed construction as directed by CFR Part 77.13. 
                  Height restrictions. Structures or vegetation may not be constructed, altered, maintained, or allowed to grow in any air space area as described hereinabove so as to project above the conical surface. The following items are exempt from this provision.

                  Where an area is covered by more than one height limitation, the more restrictive limitation shall prevail. No structure shall be erected so high as to increase the Federal Aviation Administration landing and/or approach and/or departure minimums for aircraft using the runways of the affected airports, unless the airport operator approves of such action. 
                  Administrative height exception. The Director of the Paulding County Airport may administratively grant height exceptions after review of a proposal under the following: 
                  1.  A finding by the Director of the Paulding County Airport that the structure will not exceed specifications identified in the Federal Aviation Regulations, Part 77 (Objects Affecting Navigable Airspace). 
                  Approach Areas (AA). Building permits will not be issued until the final site development plans have been approved. Such approval may include requirements to mitigate impacts of the project and to ensure that the standards of the zone are upheld. The Director of the Paulding County Airport at his/her option may require approval of site development plans consistent with the procedural requirements for residential or non-residential development application as set forth by the Paulding County Development Regulations. 
                  Accident Potential Zone A (APZ-"A"). Within areas designated as Accident Potential Zone "A" no buildings or premises shall be used nor any building or structure be erected or altered unless otherwise provided in this ordinance except for one or more of the following uses when allowed in the underlying zone.

                  5.  Non-conformance. For purposes of this section there shall be three classifications of non-conformance: (a) a non-conforming operation in a non-conforming location (i.e., an operation which does not follow the provisions of this zoning ordinance, and which is not a permitted use in the zoning district where located; (b) a conforming operation in a non-conforming location (i.e., same as (a) above except the operation of said yard is in conformance with said regulations); (c) a non-conforming operation in a conforming location (i.e., a permitted use within the district where situated, but not operating in accordance with the provisions of said regulations). 
                  (a)  Non-conforming operation in non-conforming location. The amortization period for any establishment covered by this ordinance which is non-conforming both in operation and location is three years from the date of passage of this ordinance; the owners or operators shall utilize this three-year period to conform to these regulations or remove said operations from said district; provided that whenever an owner or representative of a non-conforming use in a zoning district applies for and is granted favorable zoning (I-2 with special use permit), such person shall have a period not to exceed three months to bring the operation or establishment into complete conformity with the provisions of this ordinance. 
                  (b)  Conforming operating in non-conforming location. The amortization period for any establishment covered by this section which conforms to the provisions of this ordinance, but is not a permitted use within the district in which said operation or establishment is situated, is three years from the date of passage of this amendment; provided, however, whenever an owner or representative of said conforming use in a non-conforming location applies for and is granted favorable zoning (I-2 with special use permit), such person shall have a period not to exceed three months after said rezoning becomes effective to bring the operation or establishment into complete conformity with the provisions of this ordinance. 
                  (c)  Non-conforming operation in conforming location. The owner or operator of a non-conforming establishment which is a permitted use within the zoning district in which such operation is situated is allowed three months from he date of passage of this amendment to bring said operation into conformance with the provisions of this ordinance or such non-conforming operation shall be declared a nuisance. 
                  6.  Time limit for special use permit approvals. The approval for a special use permit under this section will expire and be void after two years from the date of issuance by the permit by the county unless a final inspection has been made and the operation is in conformance with the provisions of this ordinance. 
                  (8)  Off-street parking: See article VII of this ordinance. 
                  (9)  Sign regulations: See article XII of this ordinance. 
                  ARTICLE XI - DETERMINATION OF UNCLASSIFIED USES 

                  Sec. A. - Procedure; criteria. 
                  In the event an applicant wishes to use property for a use which is not specifically identified under inherent uses, or uses allowed with the approval of a special use permit, and where such use is not specifically prohibited from the district, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  (1)  The applicant shall submit to the community development director a written request for a determination of the unclassified use. 
                  (a)  The planning staff shall review the request as submitted and determine if the proposed use is of a similar character to the district in which it is proposed. 
                  (b)  If the planning staff determines that the use is of a similar character and meets the intent of the uses permitted inherently within the district, they shall instruct the county planner to allow said use. 
                  (c)  In the event the planning staff determines the proposed use in the district is consistent with the character and intent of a special use permit within the district, then the applicant shall apply for a special use permit subject to approval in the normal manner. 
                  (2)  If the planning staff is unable to make the determination within 14 days or the applicant chooses to appeal the staff decision, the following procedure shall apply: 
                  (a)  The county planner shall submit to the planning commission and county attorney a written request for a determination of the unclassified use at the next regular scheduled planning commission meeting.

                  ARTICLE XII. - RESERVED 
                  Editor's note— Res. No. 17-37, § 1, adopted Nov. 14, 2017, repealed Art. XII, §§ A—CC, which pertained to signs and derived from Res. No. 10-07, § 7, 5-25-2010. For current provisions, see Chapter 67. 
                  ARTICLE XIII - C-O, CORRIDOR OVERLAY DISTRICT 

                  Sec. A. - Purpose, intent and authority. 
                  (1)  Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this district to establish standards for the design of sites, buildings, structures, plantings, signs, street hardware and such other improvements that are visible to the public and affect the physical development of land within certain designated transportation corridors. 
                  The following standards shall be considered in evaluating projects proposed within the corridor overlay district. 
                  (a)  All structures will be evaluated on the overall appearance of the project and shall be based on the quality of its design and its relationship to the surrounding area. 
                  (b)  The quality of design goes beyond the materials of construction to include scale, mass, color, proportion, and compatibility with adjoining developments. 
                  (c)  Colors shall be harmonious and only the use of compatible accents shall be permitted. 
                  (d)  Building components, such as windows, doors, eaves, and parapets, shall have good proportions and relationships to one another. 
                  (e)  Any design in which the structure frame is exposed to view, the structural materials shall be compatible within themselves and harmonious with their surroundings. 
                  (f)  Monotony of design in single or multiple building projects shall be avoided. Variation of detail, form, and siting shall be used to provide visual interest. In multiple building projects, variable siting or individual buildings may be used to prevent a monotonous appearance. 
                  (2)  Statement of intent. These standards are intended to promote high quality creative development that will combine imagination, innovation and variety in the appearance of buildings and sites in the overlay zone. These standards are further intended to preserve and enhance property values and to promote the public health, safety and welfare by providing for consistent, and coordinated treatment of the property encompassed by the selected transportation corridors. 
                  Originally, a public meeting was held on March 18, 2004 in an effort to seek citizen preference regarding current growth and development patterns in Paulding County. An additional public hearing was held for this amendment on January 24, 2006. Public information was obtained in 2004 through a visual preference survey (VPS). The survey allowed citizens an opportunity to state whether they liked a photo of a development or disliked it based on design standards. Those citizens that provided input through the VPS expressed an interest in promoting developments that will allow Paulding County to grow in positive, sustainable patterns. These standards include regulatory control and design of building development and materials, parking areas, signage, transportation (pedestrian and vehicular), greenspace and trees/vegetation. 
                  (3)  Authority. Authority underlying creation of the corridor overlay zones district is provided for in O.C.G.A. § 36-66-2, Section 11 of the Paulding County Enabling Legislation and the Paulding County Code of Ordinances, 2003 Zoning Ordinance, article XV (now to be renumbered as article XVI). 
                  (4)  Statement of significance. 
                  (a)  State Route 120 (Marietta Highway) traverses the County from the east to the southwest providing access to Cobb County and Haralson County. State Route 120 (Marietta Highway) is a divided, four-lane with median from the Cobb County line to its intersection and convergence with U. S. Highway 278. For initial purposes, only the portion of Marietta Highway from the Cobb County line to the intersection with Highway 278 was included in the corridor overlay zone. Marietta Highway is considered by the Paulding County Comprehensive Plan and associated future land use map to be one of the county's primary commercial corridors. Future development of this highly visible corridor will dramatically change the image of Paulding County. With this amendment, the remaining portion of State Route 120, traversing to the west from US 278 through to the Haralson County line shall be included as a transportation corridor in order to create continuity with the other portions of State Route 120. 
                  (b)  Bill Carruth Parkway f/k/a West Hiram Parkway is located in the east-central portion of the county, west of the City of Hiram. The Parkway begins at the intersection of Marietta Highway with U. S. Highway 278 and extends southward until it intersects with State Route 92 (Hiram-Douglasville Highway), south of Hiram. The highway serves as both connector and bypass route. Bill Carruth Parkway is expected to continue to have significant development over the next five years. This development will change the suburban character of the corridor into a more intense urban environment. The impact of new development upon this corridor will create a setting that commands the highest standards of development which encourage efficient use of land, promote coordinated development, permit innovative site designs, establish development standards and preserve the integrity of the roadways within this corridor. 
                  (c)  In addition thereto, State Route 92 and State Route 61 traverse the county from Douglasville to Acworth and Villa Rica to Cartersville, respectively. Both State Routes are heavily traveled and are the sites of varied new developments. The introduction of the corridor overlay district will encourage the development in this area to project a uniform, high-quality appearance. 
                  (d)  US Highway 278 is the most heavily traveled roadway in Paulding County, and is one of only two four-lane highways in the county. It traverses the county from Powder Springs in Cobb County to Rockmart in Polk County. US 278 travels through the county's current commercial center, Hiram. As US 278 is considered by the Paulding County Comprehensive Plan and associated future land use map to be one of the county's primary commercial corridors, future development of this highly visible corridor will dramatically change the image of Paulding County. 
                  (e)  The East Hiram Parkway is a proposed highway corridor which will begin at the terminus of the Bill Carruth Parkway and continue through the eastern portion of Paulding County. The highway serves as both connector and bypass route. East Hiram Parkway is expected to have significant development over the next five years. This development will change the suburban character of the corridor into a more intense urban environment. The impact of new development upon this corridor will create a setting that commands the highest standards of development which encourage efficient use of land, promote coordinated development, permit innovative site designs, establish development standards and preserve the integrity of the roadways within this corridor. 
                  (f)  In addition thereto, all state routes in the county are designated as commercial areas in the future land use map and comprehensive plan. Paulding County does not have interstate access and therefore, the state routes remain the only other viable commercial corridors. Thus, it is important that these areas develop in a consistent manner to ensure the highest standards of development which encourage efficient use of land, promote coordinated development, permit innovative site designs, establish development standards and preserve the integrity of the roadways within this corridor. 
                  (g)  In recent years, Ridge Road has emerged as a mixed use corridor in the New Georgia area with commercial and residential developments throughout the length of the thruway. Ridge Road extends from State Route 92 to State Route 61. As Ridge Road continues to develop, it will be important to ensure continuity with design, quality, workmanship and materials in order to complete a visually pleasing development area. 
                  (h)  Finally, the airport access road will serve as the gateway to the newly constructed Paulding County General Aviation Airport. 
                  (i)  Based upon the data set forth above, the transportation corridors subject to these provisions are as follows: 
                  1.  State Route 101 and State Route 113 
                  2.  State Route 120 a/k/a Buchanan Highway

                  13.  Ridge Road 
                  14.  Access Road to the Paulding County General Aviation Airport, to be located off US 278 
                  (5)  Title. This portion of the zoning ordinance shall be known as the corridor overlay district of the County of Paulding. 
                  Sec. B. - Boundaries. 
                  (1)  General provisions. The boundaries of the roadways set forth are located on either side of the centerline of the roadway and incorporate any parcel of land with right-of-way frontage on or that is visible from the highway corridor.

                  Sec. H. - Parking requirements. 
                  Efforts to break up large expanse of pavement are to be encouraged by the interspersing of appropriate planting areas wherever possible. The number of parking spaces required is established in article VII of the zoning ordinance, depending upon the zoning and the intended land use. Alternatives to the established parking requirements may be granted to developments which have a mixture of uses whose peak parking requirements do not coincide in time and thereby may share parking spaces. The applicant shall provide expertly prepared justification for seeking such exception (i.e., a reference such as "shared parking," Urban Land Institute). There shall be an appropriate number of parking spaces, accessible to the building(s) and identification as reserved for use by handicapped individuals, and these spaces shall be of sufficient width to accommodate their needs. All parking standards shall comply with article VII of this zoning ordinance. 
                  Sec. I. - Lighting requirements. 
                  In reviewing the lighting plan for a lot proposed to be developed in the corridor overlay district, factors to be considered by the community development department shall include but are not limited to: 
                  (1)  Safety provided by the lighting; 
                  (2)  Security provided by the lighting; 
                  (3)  Possible light spillage or glare onto adjoining properties or streets. (Down-shielding is encouraged and spillage or glare onto adjoining properties is prohibited); 
                  (4)  Attractiveness of the lighting standards and their compatibility with the overall treatment of the property; 
                  (5)  Height and placement of lighting standards considering the use (maximum height of 30 feet); and 
                  (6)  Exterior lighting, when used, shall enhance the building and the adjoining landscape. Lighting standards and building fixtures shall be of a design and size compatible with the building and adjacent areas. Lighting shall be restrained in design and excessive brightness avoided. 
                  Sec. J. - Access to individual sites. 
                  The transportation corridors by their functional nature as primary thoroughfares, must have reasonable restrictions as to the number and location of access points within the overlay zones. 
                  All roadways listed as transportation corridors represent major thoroughfares, which must be controlled as to the number of access points (curb cuts) permitted. 
                  Therefore, in order to provide safe and sufficient traffic movement to and from adjacent lands and to protect the functional integrity of the corridors primary thoroughfares, in many cases frontage roads, access roads, and distributors roads, will have to be built. Such roads shall be coordinated with those of continuous lots and designed to preserve the aesthetic benefits provided by the greenbelt areas. Access at the side or rear of buildings is encouraged. New access points onto the primary thoroughfares in the corridor shall be coordinated with existing access points whenever possible. The following curb cut policy shall apply throughout all corridors: 
                  Access to proposed developments shall be provided per Georgia Department of Transportation and/or Paulding County Department of Transportation access management standards, policies, guidelines and regulations. 
                  Sec. K. - Access to potential development sites. 
                  Stub streets shall be built in all cases where adjacent lots have reasonable potential for development. Reasonable potential shall include any adjacent parcel of adequate size for commercial or residential development or any adjacent parcel so determined by the community development department in association with the Paulding County Department of Transportation. 
                  Sec. L. - Other standards. 
                  (1)  Outside storage prohibited (seasonal sales). No outside, unenclosed storage of refuse (whether or not in containers) or display of merchandise shall be permitted on any lot. All refuse shall be contained completely within the principle or accessory building(s). Exceptions to this requirement will be made on a case-by-case basis by the board of zoning appeals using the variance procedure outlined in article XV. Seasonal sales are allowed four times a year with written approval from the director of community development for a maximum of 30 days. Outdoor sales (if allowed by the underlying zoning district) must be covered. Examples of coverings include but are not limited to tents and awnings. 
                  (2)  Loading berth requirements. Loading berth requirements shall be as specified in the underlying zone district(s), except that any loading or unloading berth or bay shall be screened from view beyond the site by landscaping or other screening. 
                  (3)  Accessory buildings and uses. All accessory buildings and uses which are permitted in the underlying zoning district(s) shall be permitted within the corridor overlay district, except that any detached accessory building on any lot shall be designed to be architecturally designed and constructed with the same material as the principle building as to be compatible with the principle building which it is associated. All accessory building shall have a roof. 
                  (4)  Paving requirements. All parking areas shall be finished with a hard surface such as asphalt, concrete or other materials approved by the community development department.

                  (6)  Temporary or seasonal sales. Temporary or seasonal sales are allowed along the highway corridor on a case-by-case basis for a maximum of four times per year with written approval from the director of community development for a maximum of 30 days. Request for temporary or seasonal sales shall be made in writing accompanied by a recorded plat of the site and written permission by the property owner to the director of community development. A Paulding County business license is required of all approved temporary or seasonal sales.

                  1.3 - Intent and application. 
                  It is the intent of these regulations that they apply to and provide guidance for the development of any lands within the unincorporated area of Paulding County, or any other areas over which the Paulding County Board of Commissioners has authority pertaining to land development. These regulations apply to all land-disturbing activity and development activity, whether the development involves the subdivision of land for sale to individual users or pertains only to the construction of buildings or other improvements on a single parcel. 
                  1.4 - Agricultural exemption. 
                  Clearly agricultural uses, limited to the cultivation of the land, dairying or animal husbandry, are not intended to be governed by these regulations, provided that land proposed to be converted to a new agricultural use must be zoned A-1 to be exempt from the provisions herein. 
                  1.5 - Subdivision of property. 
                  1.5.1 Subdivision of two or more lots. These regulations shall govern all subdivision of land into two or more individual parcels or lots, within the unincorporated limits of Paulding County, Georgia, or any other areas over which the Paulding County Board of Commissioners has authority pertaining to land development. 
                  1.5.2 Preapplication review. Whenever the subdivision of a tract of land is proposed, the subdivider is urged to consult with the Paulding County Development Control Committee. The subdivider may submit concept plans and data showing existing conditions within the site and its vicinity and the proposed development layout of the subdivision. 
                  1.5.3 Approvals. The development control committee shall approve all preliminary plats and construction plans in accordance with these regulations. 
                  1.5.4 Time limits on preliminary plat and construction plan approval. Preliminary plats shall be good for a period of one year after development control committee approval. Within that year construction plans must be submitted and approved. Construction of the project must begin within one year of construction plan approval. If these time limits are exceeded, the project shall be void and subject to reapplication. 
                  1.5.5 Construction of phased developments. Developers shall be responsible for damages and maintenance of previously accepted streets. When construction traffic of new phases/developments impact severely on existing county streets, as determined by the Paulding County Community Development Department, and the developer fails to take necessary corrective action, the developer's maintenance bond may be used for these off site repairs and maintenance. 
                  1.5.6 Status of platted streets and other public spaces and utilities. After final approval by the development control committee and the completion of all improvements required by these regulations and the expiration of the required maintenance bond period, the subdivider may request the county to accept platted streets and other public spaces and utilities. 
                  1.5.7 Priority of health department. Nothing contained in these regulations shall be construed as preventing the health department, after study of the conditions existing in a proposed subdivision, from requiring that all or any portion of the area of such subdivision shall not be built upon or that the minimum lot sizes set forth in these regulations are inadequate and must be increased to insure the protection of public health. 
                  1.6 - Subdivision lot criteria. 
                  1.6.1 Jurisdictional boundary lines. Lots shall not be divided by corporate or county boundary lines. 
                  1.6.2 Corner lots. Corner lots shall be sufficiently large to permit the location of buildings so as to conform with the building lines on both streets. Corner lots shall have driveways on only one street. 
                  1.6.3 Double frontage. 
                  1)  For double frontage lots (i.e., lots having street frontage both in front and rear) in residential subdivisions along major thoroughfares, a no-access easement of at least ten feet in width, across which there shall be no right of access, shall be provided along the line of lots abutting said major thoroughfare. The no-access easement shall be planted with a single line of shrubs or trees, or contain a solid or decorative fence, or contain other such screening treatment as may be proposed by the developer and approved by the development control committee. 
                  2)  For double frontage lots in subdivisions along minor collectors or local streets, there shall also be a no-access easement as described in the paragraph immediately above, except that any planting or screening of the no-access easement shall be at the sole option of the developer. 
                  1.6.4 Lot lines. Insofar as practical, side lot lines shall be at right angles to straight street lines and radial to curved street line. 
                  1.6.5 Minimum lot dimensions and area. The minimum lot width at the front building line and minimum lot area shall be in accordance with the Paulding County Zoning Ordinance. 
                  1.6.6 Lot depth. Except in instances of extreme topography or unusual physical conditions, lot depth shall not be more than four times the lot width at the building line. 
                  1.6.7 Street access. 
                  1)  Every lot hereafter established shall front or abut on a street which is to be dedicated to the public and conforms to the requirements of these regulations, unless on an approved driveway easement or as otherwise approved by the development control committee. Generally, lots shall not derive access exclusively from any street designated as an arterial or collector street on the roadway classification map. If access must be obtained from an arterial or collector street, single-family residential driveways shall be designed and arranged to avoid requiring vehicles to back into traffic. Multiple family residential driveways and drives serving all nonresidential land uses shall be designed and arranged to avoid requiring vehicles to back into traffic on all streets. 
                  2)  A maximum of 250 residential dwelling units shall be allowed to be constructed with only one street outlet on an existing public street. If a second access to an existing public street is not available or, in the opinion of the development control committee, could induce nonresidential traffic through the development, a single entrance may be allowed if designed with a traffic signal and/or sufficient right-of-way and improvements to provide a protected left-turn lane, subject to the approval of the Paulding County Department of Transportation. 
                  1.7 - Easements. 
                  1.7.1 Utility easements. When it is found to be necessary and desirable to locate public utility lines in other than street rights-of-way, easements shall be shown on the plat for such purposes. Such easements shall not be less than 12 feet in width and, where possible, shall be centered on rear or side lot lines. 
                  1.7.2 Watercourse and drainage easements. Where a proposed subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainage way or stream, appropriate provisions shall be made to accommodate stormwater and drainage through and from the proposed subdivision. Such easement shall conform substantially with the lines of said watercourse and be of sufficient width for construction and/or maintenance. All easements and appropriate storm drain pipes shall be subject to the following: 
                  Easements for Watercourse and Drainage Storm Drain Pipes 

                   
                  1.7.3 Private easement subdivisions. 
                  1)  There is hereby created a classification of subdivisions known as "private easement subdivisions." This classification is to be used in those instances where there has been a subdivision of property by a person (hereinafter referred to as the "subdivider") wherein the property lacks the minimum required amount of county road frontage in order to obtain building permits. 
                  2)  When a subdivider desires to create a private easement subdivision, the following shall apply: 
                  (a)  The person desiring to create the private easement subdivision shall make application to the development control committee in the same manner as all other subdivisions are approved in Paulding County. The person shall submit to the development control committee six copies of the final plat along with copies of any deed restrictions or road maintenance agreements that will affect the property being subdivided. The final plat must be labeled as a private easement subdivision. 
                  (b)  On each deed that is conveyed by the subdivider to any other person of the property contained in the private easement subdivision the following language must be shown on the deed: 
                  "The grantee herein recognizes that any and all means of ingress and egress to the property conveyed hereby that is provided by the grantor or his successors or assigns are considered by the Paulding County Development Control Committee and the governing body of Paulding County to be a private easement and is not maintainable by said governing body. The grantee and the property owner hereby agree that they will be responsible for their proportionate share of the upkeep and maintenance of this private easement and completely hold the governing body of Paulding County harmless from any necessity for such upkeep and maintenance." 
                  (c)  There shall be a maximum of three single-family dwelling permits issued for each private easement subdivision. Waivers of this requirement may be submitted to the development waiver review committee pursuant to article 14 of this ordinance. Provided however, in no event shall more than six building permits be allowed fronting off a single easement access through the waiver and/or variance process except that any lot of record which meets requirement 1.7.3(d) and existed prior to September 12, 2006, as confirmed by the planning and zoning division manager, may be used as a building site for one single-family dwelling. 
                  1.  In addition to the requirements set forth herein and within article 14, the development waiver review committee and/or Paulding County Board of Commissioners, shall require written notification of the waiver application to all persons with residences located on the private easement of the waiver application. 
                  2.  The development waiver review committee and/or the board of commissioners, at its discretion and request, may require a joint maintenance agreement for the private easement as a part of the application and/or approval process. 
                  3.  As a part of the variance application for an additional permit, the applicant must show special circumstances and/or a hardship as the basis for the request for an additional permit. 
                  4.  In addition, as part of any waiver or variance application, the applicant shall provide a title certificate from a licensed attorney certifying the title of the property being applied for and the specific ability of the applicant to subdivide the easement rights to allow for another easement access point and building permit. 
                  (d)  Each subdivided lot contained in a private easement subdivision shall be a minimum of two acres in size. 
                  (e)  The minimum width of the private easement servicing the private easement subdivision shall be 30 feet wide. 
                  (f)  There shall be no more than one private easement subdivision for every 500 feet of county road frontage unless the development control committee specifically finds that this would create an undue hardship on a proposed subdivider and allows a modification of this item. 
                  (g)  All easements for private easement subdivisions shall be inspected by the county department of transportation to determine if the private easement is suitable for drainage, travel of emergency vehicles and proper maintenance by the property owners. The proposed easement road is to be a minimum 15-foot gravel surface with a 40 foot turn-around, dead end. 
                  (h)  The subdivider shall install any pipe required by the county and the subdivider or his heirs or assigns shall be responsible for all maintenance of said easement as shown by the deed restrictions. 
                  (i)  All state and county specifications shall apply to all construction of buildings on all lots contained in the private easement subdivision. 
                  (j)  In order to facilitate the location of persons by emergency vehicle personnel, mailboxes of parties residing on the easement shall be placed at the intersection of the easement with the county-maintained road with complete names and addresses of the parties living on the easement posted thereon.

                  1.8.10 Street trees (nonresidential developments only). The planting of street trees is required within nonresidential developments in order to enhance the appearance of such developments. The minimum required tree planting is one tree for every 35 linear feet of road frontage. The minimum tree size is two-inch caliper or larger, as measured at the diameter breast height.

                  3.1 - Developments of regional impact. 
                  The Georgia Planning Act of 1989 authorized the department of community affairs (DCA) to establish procedures for regional review of development projects that are of sufficient size that they are likely to create impacts beyond the jurisdiction in which the project will be located. These large-scale projects are referred to as developments of regional impact (DRIs). Projects that exceed the minimum thresholds established by the DCA are required to go the DRI process prior to commencement of development activity. This process involves submittal to the Coosa Valley Regional Development Center (RDC) and review and comments from other local governments and affected parties. Within 30 days, the RDC will issue the results of the review process including a review finding that the proposed activity is or is not in the best interest of the state.

                  4.1.3 Water pressure, flow test, and fire hydrant spacing requirements for preliminary plat approval. (Revised 2001) 
                  1)  A water pressure and flow test shall be conducted and approved by Paulding County before applying for preliminary plat review and approval as described in section 4.1.4 below. An approved water pressure and flow test is defined as a corrected flow rate (Q C ) that meets the minimum fire flow rate as outlined in the table below. 
                  2)  In addition to any other preliminary plat requirements, the following information shall be provided on the preliminary plat; tested flow rate (Q T ), pressure recording chart (minimum 24-hour, however, pressure recording duration may be increased at the discretion of the water and sewer system director) , static pressure, residual pressure, tested hydrant location, tested hydrant elevation, date of field flow test measurements, computed available flow rate (Q A ) at the field tested hydrant, corrected flow rate (Q C ) for the proposed development location, all associated computations, and the appropriate hydrant spacing in accordance with the table below. 
                  3)  The tested flow rate (Q T ), shall be computed the using the orifice equation below based on the actual field measurements: 
                  Q T = [27 (d) 2 (P) 0.5 ] * k 
                  Where: 
                  Q T (gpm) = tested flow rate at the pilot location, reported in gallons per minute 
                  d (in) = orifice diameter tested, typically 2.5 inches 
                  P (psi) = pilot pressure measured in the flow stream 
                  k (unitless) = flow discharge efficiency factor, generally accepted to be 0.90 
                  4)  The available flow rate (Q A ) shall be computed by adjusting the tested flow rate at the pilot location for the minimum allowable residual pressure (20-psi) , deviations in hydrant testing elevations, low hydraulic grade line conditions (corrected at 50 percent of the tank overflow elevation) , and the sustained 24-hr pressure (pump-off) conditions. The available flow rate (Q A ) shall be computed using the following equation: 
                  Q A = { ([s' -20)/(S - R)] 0.54 } * Q T 
                  Where: 
                  Q A (gpm) = available flow rate at the pilot location, adjusted for local field conditions 
                  s' (psi) = static pressure adjusted for low hydraulic grade line conditions 
                  S (psi) = static pressure prior to hydrant flow test 
                  R (psi) = residual pressure during hydrant flow test 
                  5)  The minimum fire flow rate used to design a proposed development shall correspond to the corrected flow rate (qc) that has been projected to the proposed development. The corrected flow rate (qc) shall be computed by adjusting the available flow rate (qa) to reflect conditions at the proposed development site. Corrected flows may be projected from the nearest water distribution main where the field measured flow test was performed to a proposed development location using accepted hydraulic engineering design practices that account for changes in elevation head, frictional losses through meters, etc. 
                  6)  Minimum fire flow and maximum hydrant spacing shall be completed in compliance with the chart below. 
                  Minimum fire flow and maximum hydrant spacing

                   
                  a.  Minimum flow may be upwardly adjusted based upon the written recommendation of the county fire chief setting forth any special /conditions of the development which require additional flow. 
                  b.  Fire hydrants shall be located at the end of every water line, the back of cul-de-sacs, and the entrances of new developments regardless of the maximum allowable spacing distances. Hydrants shall be located at road intersections whenever feasible as determined during the plan review process. 
                  c.  For commercial/industrial developments, the hydrant spacing shall be the hose lay distance and shall be measured from all portions of the building exterior. 
                  In the event the corrected flow rate for a proposed development is less than the minimum required flow rate in the minimum fire flow and hydrant spacing table above, an owner/developer may elect to propose off-site improvements to the water distribution system that would result in an increase in the corrected flow rate (qc). All proposed system improvements shall be designed by an independent professional engineer at the expense of the owner/developer. The proposed improvements shall be reviewed by the water and sewer system department and authorized by the water and sewer system director. Any approved off-site improvements shall be described on the preliminary plat prior to preliminary plat review and approval as described in section 4.1.4 below. 
                  7)  The fee for the water pressure and flow test shall be administered through the Paulding County Water and Sewer System Department. The Paulding County Water and Sewer System Department should be contacted for additional information regarding the water pressure and flow test.

                  (Res. No. 10-18, §§ 1, 2, 8-10-2010) 
                  ARTICLE 4.15 - C-O, CORRIDOR OVERLAY DISTRICT 

                  4.15.1 - Purpose, intent, and authority. 
                  1)  Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this district to establish standards for the design of sites, buildings, structures, plantings, signs, street hardware and such other improvements that are visible to the public and affect the physical development of land within certain designated transportation corridors. 
                  The following standards shall be considered in evaluating projects proposed within the corridor overlay district. 
                  (a)  All structures will be evaluated on the overall appearance of the project and shall be based on the quality of its design and its relationship to the surrounding area. 
                  (b)  The quality of design goes beyond the materials of construction to include scale, mass, color, proportion, and compatibility with adjoining developments. 
                  (c)  Colors shall be harmonious and only the use of compatible accents shall be permitted. 
                  (d)  Building components, such as windows, doors, eaves, and parapets, shall have good proportions and relationships to one another. 
                  (e)  Any design in which the structure frame is exposed to view, the structural materials shall be compatible within themselves and harmonious with their surroundings. 
                  (f)  Monotony of design in single or multiple building projects shall be avoided. Variation of detail, form, and siting shall be used to provide visual interest. In multiple building projects, variable siting or individual buildings may be used to prevent a monotonous appearance. 
                  2)  Statement of intent. These standards are intended to promote high quality creative development that will combine imagination, innovation and variety in the appearance of buildings and sites in the overlay zone. These standards are further intended to preserve and enhance property values and to promote the public health, safety and welfare by providing for consistent, and coordinated treatment of the property encompassed by the selected transportation corridors. 
                  Originally, a public meeting was held on March 18, 2004 in an effort to seek citizen preference regarding current growth and development patterns in Paulding County. An additional public hearing was held for this amendment on January 24, 2006. Public information was obtained in 2004 through a Visual Preference Survey (VPS). The survey allowed citizens an opportunity to state whether they liked a photo of a development or disliked it based on design standards. Those citizens that provided input through the VPS expressed an interest in promoting developments that will allow Paulding County to grow in positive, sustainable patterns. These standards include regulatory control and design of building development and materials, parking areas, signage, transportation (pedestrian and vehicular), greenspace and trees/vegetation. 
                  3)  Authority. Authority underlying creation of the corridor overlay zones district is provided for in O.C.G.A. Section 36-66-2, Section 11 of the Paulding County Enabling Legislation and the Paulding County Code of Ordinances, 2003 Zoning Ordinance, Article XV. 
                  4)  Statement of significance. 
                  (a)  State Route 120 (Marietta Highway) traverses the county from the east to the southwest providing access to Cobb County and Haralson County. State Route 120 (Marietta Highway) is a divided, four-lane with median from the Cobb County line to its intersection and convergence with U.S. Highway 278. For initial purposes, only the portion of Marietta Highway from the Cobb County line to the intersection with Highway 278 was included in the Corridor Overlay Zone. Marietta Highway is considered by the Paulding County Comprehensive Plan and associated Future Land Use Map to be one of the county's primary commercial corridors. Future development of this highly visible corridor will dramatically change the image of Paulding County. With this amendment, the remaining portion of State Route 120, traversing to the west from U.S. 278 through to the Haralson County line shall be included as a transportation corridor in order to create continuity with the other portions of State Route 120. 
                  (b)  Bill Carruth Parkway f/k/a West Hiram Parkway is located in the east-central portion of the county, west of the City of Hiram. The parkway begins at the intersection of Marietta Highway with U.S. Highway 278 and extends southward until it intersects with State Route 92 (Hiram-Douglasville Highway), South of Hiram. The highway serves as both connector and bypass route. Bill Carruth Parkway is expected to have significant development over the next five years. This development will change the suburban character of the corridor into a more intense urban environment. The impact of new development upon this corridor will create a setting that commands the highest standards of development which encourage efficient use of land, promote coordinated development, permit innovative site designs, establish development standards and preserve the integrity of the roadways within this corridor. 
                  (c)  In addition thereto, State Route 92 and State Route 61 traverse the county from Douglasville to Acworth and Villa Rica to Cartersville, respectively. Both state routes are heavily traveled and are the sites of varied new developments. The introduction of the corridor overlay district will encourage the development in this area to project a uniform, high-quality appearance. 
                  (d)  U.S. Highway 278 is the most heavily traveled roadway in Paulding County, and is one of only two four-lane highways in the county. It traverses the county from Powder Springs in Cobb County to Rockmart in Polk County. U.S. 278 travels through the county's current commercial center, Hiram. As U.S. 278 is considered by the Paulding County Comprehensive Plan and associated future land use map to be one of the county's primary commercial corridors, future development of this highly visible corridor will dramatically change the image of Paulding County. 
                  (e)  The East Hiram Parkway is a proposed highway corridor which will begin at the terminus of the Bill Carruth Parkway and continue through the eastern portion of Paulding County. The highway serves as both connector and bypass route. East Hiram Parkway is expected to have significant development over the next five years. This development will change the suburban character of the corridor into a more intense urban environment. The impact of new development upon this corridor will create a setting that commands the highest standards of development which encourage efficient use of land, promote coordinated development, permit innovative site designs, establish development standards and preserve the integrity of the roadways within this corridor. 
                  (f)  In addition thereto, all state routes in the county are designated as commercial areas in the future land use map and comprehensive plan. Paulding County does not have interstate access and therefore, the state routes remain the only other viable commercial corridors. Thus, it is important that these areas develop in a consistent manner to ensure the highest standards of development which encourage efficient use of land, promote coordinated development, permit innovative site designs, establish development standards and preserve the integrity of the roadways within this corridor. 
                  (g)  In recent years, Ridge Road has emerged as a mixed use corridor in the new Georgia area with commercial and residential developments throughout the length of the thruway. Ridge Road extends from State Route 92 to State Route 61. As Ridge Road continues to develop, it will be important to ensure continuity with design, quality, workmanship and materials in order to complete a visually pleasing development area. 
                  (h)  Finally, the airport access road will serve as the gateway to the newly constructed Paulding County General Aviation Airport. 
                  (i)  Based upon the data set forth above, the transportation corridors subject to these provisions are as follows: 
                  1.  State Route 101 and State Route 113 
                  2.  State Route 120 a/k/a Buchanan Highway 
                  3.  State Route 120 a/k/a Marietta Highway 
                  4.  State Route 120 connector a/k/a Scoggins Road and Hiram Sudie Road 
                  5.  U.S. Highway 278 
                  6.  State Route 61 a/k/a Cartersville Highway and Villa Rica Highway 
                  7.  State Route 92 a/k/a Hiram-Acworth Highway, Hiram-Douglasville Highway and Dallas-Acworth Highway 
                  8.  East Hiram Parkway

                  (a)  Installation. All landscaping required by the approved landscaping plan shall be installed prior to the issuance of a building certificate of occupancy permit if said permit is issued during a planting season, or within six months of the date an occupancy permit is issued during a nonplanting season. If not planted, a bond shall be required for plantings for a period of one year (12-months) from date of certificate of occupancy. 
                  (b)  Maintenance. It shall be the responsibility of the owners and their agencies to insure proper maintenance of the landscaping, in accordance with the standards set by this ordinance and as indicated on the landscaping plan, which has been approved by the community development department. This is to include, but not limited to, replaced dead plantings with identical varieties or a suitable substitute, and keeping the area free of refuse and debris. 
                  (c)  Changes after approval. No landscaping which has been approved by the community development department may later be altered, eliminated, or sacrificed, without first obtaining further approval from the community development department. 
                  (d)  Inspection. The community development department shall have the authority to visit any lot within the corridor overlay zone to inspect the landscaping and check it against the approved plan on file. 
                  4.15.7 - Sidewalk requirements. 
                  The installation of sidewalks and crosswalks in all developments, residential and commercial, shall be required for developments subject to this ordinance. The sidewalks shall be constructed of concrete and shall be subject to review and approval by the community development staff as to size, location, design and materials during the plan review process. 
                  4.15.8 - Parking requirements. 
                  Efforts to break up large expanse of pavement are to be encouraged by the interspersing of appropriate planting areas wherever possible. The number of parking spaces required is established in article VII of this zoning ordinance, depending upon the zoning and the intended land use. Alternatives to the established parking requirements may be granted to developments which have a mixture of uses whose peak parking requirements do not coincide in time and thereby may share parking spaces. The applicant shall provide expertly prepared justification for seeking such exception (i.e., a reference such as "shared parking," Urban land institute). There shall be an appropriate number of parking spaces, accessible to the building(s) and identification as reserved for use by handicapped individuals, and these spaces shall be of sufficient width to accommodate their needs. All parking standards shall comply with article vii of this zoning ordinance. 
                  4.15.9 - Lighting requirements. 
                  In reviewing the lighting plan for a lot proposed to be developed in the corridor overlay district, factors to be considered by the community development shall include but are not limited to: 
                  1)  Safety provided by the lighting; 
                  2)  Security provided by the lighting; 
                  3)  Possible light spillage or glare onto adjoining properties or streets. (Down-shielding is encouraged and spillage or glare onto adjoining properties is prohibited); 
                  4)  Attractiveness of the lighting standards and their compatibility with the overall treatment of the property; 
                  5)  Height and placement of lighting standards considering the use (maximum height of 30 feet); and. 
                  6)  Exterior lighting, when used, shall enhance the building and the adjoining landscape. Lighting standards and building fixtures shall be of a design and size compatible with the building and adjacent areas. Lighting shall be restrained in design and excessive brightness avoided. 
                  4.15.10 - Access to individual sites. 
                  The transportation corridors by their functional nature as primary thoroughfares, must have reasonable restrictions as to the number and location of access points within the overlay zones. 
                  All roadways listed as transportation corridors represent major thoroughfares, which must be controlled as to the number of access points (curb cuts) permitted. 
                  Therefore, in order to provide safe and sufficient traffic movement to and from adjacent lands and to protect the functional integrity of the corridors primary thoroughfares, in many cases frontage roads, access roads, and distributors roads, will have to be built. Such roads shall be coordinated with those of continuous lots and designed to preserve the aesthetic benefits provided by the greenbelt areas. Access at the side or rear of buildings is encouraged. New access points onto the primary thoroughfares in the corridor shall be coordinated with existing access points whenever possible. The following curb cut policy shall apply throughout all corridors: 
                  Access to proposed developments shall be provided per Georgia Department of Transportation and/or Paulding County Department of Transportation access management standards, policies, guidelines and regulations. 
                  4.15.11 - Access to potential development sites. 
                  Stub streets shall be built in all cases where adjacent lots have reasonable potential for development. Reasonable potential shall include any adjacent parcel of adequate size for commercial or residential development or any adjacent parcel so determined by the community development department in association with the Paulding County Department of Transportation. 
                  4.15.12 - Other standards. 
                  1)  Outside storage prohibited. (Seasonal sales). No outside, unenclosed storage of refuse (whether or not in containers) or display of merchandise shall be permitted on any lot. All refuse shall be contained completely within the principle or accessory building(s). Exceptions to this requirement will be made on a case-by-case basis by the board of zoning appeals using the variance procedure outlined in article XV. Seasonal sales are allowed four times a year with written approval from the director of community development for a maximum of 30-days. Outdoor sales (if allowed by the underlying zoning district) must be covered. Examples of coverings include but are not limited to tents and awnings. 
                  2)  Loading berth requirements. Loading berth requirements shall be as specified in the underlying zone district(s), except that any loading or unloading berth or bay shall be screened from view beyond the site by landscaping or other screening. 
                  3)  Accessory buildings and uses. All accessory buildings and uses which are permitted in the underlying zoning district(s) shall be permitted within the corridor overlay district, except that any detached accessory building on any lot shall be designed to be architecturally designed and constructed with the same material as the principle building as to be compatible with the principle building which it is associated. All accessory buildings shall have a roof. 
                  4)  Paving requirements. All parking areas shall be finished with a hard surface such as asphalt, concrete or other materials approved by the community development department. 
                  5)  All utilities including but not limited to electric, cable, and phone services shall be underground unless otherwise approved by the community development department after written submittal providing justification for overhead utility services. 
                  6)  Temporary or seasonal sales. Temporary or seasonal sales are allowed along the highway corridor on a case-by-case basis for a maximum of four times per year with written approval from the director of community development for a maximum of 30 days. Request for temporary or seasonal sales shall be made in writing accompanied by a recorded plat of the site and written permission from the property owners to the director of community development. A Paulding County Business License is required of all approved temporary or seasonal sales.

                  5.4.1 Conformance. The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade and location of all streets shall conform at a minimum to the comprehensive plan and these regulations. 
                  5.4.2 Local streets and minor collectors. Local streets shall be so laid out that their use by through traffic will be discouraged. Minor collectors shall be provided to channel through traffic movements within a development, where appropriate to the design and a major thoroughfare is not proposed by the comprehensive plan. Minor collectors also may be provided as central routes within large residential subdivisions, where appropriate to the design, based on project traffic demands exceeding 2,000 trips per day (ADT). 
                  5.4.3 Cul-de-sac streets. 
                  1)  Dead end streets designed to have one end permanently closed shall provide a cul-de-sac turnaround and may be no more than 2,000 feet in length. Additional length necessitated by topography or property configuration may be approved by the department. 
                  2)  The length of a cul-de-sac street shall be measured from the center of the cul-de-sac back to the center of the originating intersection.

Such dead end streets shall be designed so as to allow their reasonable extension, and shall be located so as to be reasonably incorporated into a street design for the neighboring property. The stub street requirement may be waived by the department under extenuating circumstances. 
                  2)  Dead end streets on abutting property shall be extended into a proposed subdivision and incorporated into the street design of the development. This requirement may be modified by the department in cases of serious topographical hardship or dissimilar zoning which would create unacceptable land use conflicts between the two developments. This modification may be conditioned on the provision of easements necessary for the extension of public utilities, the provision of cul-de-sac or other permanent turnaround on the dead end street, or the removal of the dead end street back to its nearest intersection. 
                  3)  Where a dead end street (other than a cul-de-sac) serves more than three lots, the developer shall be required to provide a temporary vehicular turnaround within the right-of-way. This requirement may be waved if extension of the dead end street is approved and under construction prior to its inclusion in a final plat. 
                  4)  Where a street dead ends at the property boundary and the street exceeds 1,000 feet in length, a permanent cul-de-sac shall be required. In this situation, right-of-way to the property boundary shall be required, but the pavement shall not be extended to the property boundary beyond the edge of the paved cul-de-sac turnaround. In no case shall a dead end street exceed 2,000 feet in length unless approved by the department due to unusual topographic conditions or property configuration. 
                  5.4.5 Service roads. Where a development borders on or contains a railroad right-of-way, or a limited access highway right-of-way or a major thoroughfare, a public street may be required to be constructed and dedicated within the development approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way. 
                  5.4.6 Half-streets. Half-streets (new boundary streets having one-half of the minimum required right-of-way or pavement width) shall not be allowed nor access to same be permitted should it exist. 
                  5.4.7 Reserve strips. Land in private ownership adjacent to public rights-of-way which could control or are intended to control access to streets, alleys, or public lands shall not be permitted unless their control is given to the county under ownership, dedication, or easement conditions approved by the county attorney or acceptable to the department. No development shall be designed so as to deny access to abutting properties. 
                  5.4.8 Alleys. Alleys shall not be provided except where the subdivider produces evidence satisfactory to the department of the need. In the event the department approves a design that proposes alleys, the alley shall be constructed as though it were a local street pursuant to the standards contained in these regulations. 
                  5.4.9 Street jogs. 
                  1)  Street jogs shall either directly align or have off-sets of a minimum of 125 feet for residential S1 and S2 streets. 
                  2)  All arterials and collectors shall provide off-sets as required by the department, where alignment is not desirable or feasible, but in no case be spaced less than 600 feet apart as measured between centerlines of said streets. 
                  5.5 - Specifications. 
                  Unless otherwise specifically set forth herein, all of the materials, methods of construction and workmanship for the work covered in reference to street construction shall conform to the latest specifications of the Georgia Department of Transportation (Georgia DOT). 
                  5.6 - Subgrade preparation for all streets. 
                  5.6.1 Procedures and requirements for subgrade preparation.

                  2)  If any sections of the subgrade are composed of topsoil, organic or other unsuitable or unstable material (the top 12 inches less than 100 cubic pounds), such material shall be removed and replaced with suitable material and then thoroughly compacted as specified for fill or stabilized with stone or a geo-textile, geo-grid or other suitable materials approved by the department. 
                  3)  Fill shall be placed in uniform, horizontal layers not more than eight inches thick (loose measurement). Moisture content shall be adjusted as necessary to compact material to 95 percent of maximum dry density except for the top 12 inches, which shall be compacted to 100 of maximum dry density. 
                  4)  After the earthwork has been completed, all storm drainage, water, and sanitary sewer utilities have been installed within the right-of-way as appropriate, and the backfill in all such ditches thoroughly compacted, the subgrade shall be brought to the lines, grades and typical roadway shown on the plans. 
                  5)  Utility trenches cut in the subgrade shall be backfilled as specified herein. Compaction tests at the rate of one per 150 feet of trench shall be provided to verify compaction. 
                  6)  The subgrade must pass roll testing prior to placement of the base material. With the approval of the Paulding County Department of Transportation, a geo-textile or grid may be used to stabilize a subgrade that does not pass proofrolling. 
                  7)  When the street is to be used for construction traffic before the paving work is completed, a layer of stone (except crusher run) shall be laid as a traffic surface. This material shall not be used as a part of the base material. It may be worked into the subgrade, or it shall be removed before the base course is set up for paving. 
                  8)  Provisions shall be made to drain low points in the road construction when the final paving is delayed. A break in the berm section is required when the curbing has not been constructed. Once curbing has been installed, a three inch notch in the curb at the throat section of the low point inlet shall be cut to the depth of the binder course to provide drainage. No areas of ponding shall be created. After the final pavement surface coat has been applied, the notch shall then be filled in.

                  7.1 - Preconstruction requirements. 
                  7.1.1 Contractor qualifications. Contractors performing sewer line installations must be licensed in accordance with State of Georgia law and local ordinances and approved by the water, sewer and environmental services department (hereafter referred to in this article as "the department"). They should be completely familiar with the procedures and contract requirements associated with this type of project. Unsatisfactory work will cause a contractor to not be approved for future work. 
                  7.1.2 Soil erosion and sedimentation control plan. Developers, engineers, design professionals and contractors performing work in Paulding County are responsible for following the terms and provisions of article 9 of these regulations on soil erosion and sedimentation control. 
                  7.1.3 Easement acquisition and utility encroachment permits. 
                  1)  It shall be the responsibility of the developer to obtain any off-site easements required to connect the project to existing public sanitary sewers. Easements will be conveyed to the department for all facilities that are to be conveyed to the department. This process must be started early enough to allow construction of the sanitary sewer before any building construction is to begin. No building permits, water meter or sanitary sewer tap applications can be issued until off-site water mains and sanitary sewers have been constructed and accepted. 
                  2)  All easements shall allow adequate room to construct the sanitary sewer and appurtenances. Permanent easements shall be a minimum of 20 feet wide, ten feet on each side of the line; except, however, that when the depth of the sanitary sewer exceeds ten feet the required sanitary sewer easement width shall increase such that the easement width is at least twice the depth from the ground surface to the bottom of the pipe. 
                  3)  Easement drawings shall be prepared for work outside the development prior to approval of the sanitary sewer plans. The drawings shall be of a size suitable for legal recording and shall be prepared by a registered land surveyor. The drawing will show property lines, the name of property owners with length of line encroaching on each property owner, size of line, line designation, manhole number and stations, width of permanent and construction easement, scale of drawing, north arrow, land lot and district numbers, and a tie to the nearest land lot corner. Any streets or other existing easements shall also be shown. Easement agreements referencing these drawings shall be prepared and attached to the drawings, signed by the property owners, and recorded at the Paulding County Clerk of Superior Court's office. 
                  4)  The designer shall furnish appropriate drawings for submittal to the owner of any state or federal highways, railroads, power lines, water lines, gas lines, petroleum lines or any other utility lines on which the sanitary sewer construction will encroach. The drawing shall normally be 8½ inches x 11 inches or 8½ inches x 14 inches and shall show a plan view and a profile view. The drawing will show the same information required for easement drawings. Also, the drawing will show the right-of-way of the existing street or utility, the owner's designation of the line, the name or number of the nearest intersection or mile post or tower number and the distance to that appurtenance. The clearance distance between the street surface, or the bottom of the rail, or the utility and the sanitary sewer will be shown. The drawing will show the type of material to be used for the sanitary sewer and the method of construction to be used. The drawing will also contain any other special information required by the owner of the facility on which the sanitary sewer is encroaching. Three copies of the utility encroachment drawing will be furnished with the plans when they are submitted for approval. Construction permits shall not be issued until the utility encroachment permit has been obtained and until any special conditions such as insurance requirements have been complied with. 
                  7.2 - Design criteria. 
                  7.2.1 General. The criteria listed herein are not intended to cover all aspects of design, but rather to mention the basic guidelines and those particulars that are required by the Paulding County Department of Water, Sewer and Environmental Services. For more detailed criteria, the reader should refer to standard references such as "Ten States Standards," Georgia EPD Regulations, Water Pollution Control Federation Manual of Practice No. FD-5, and other available literature. 
                  7.2.2 Sanitary sewers separate from storm sewers. Sanitary sewers shall be designed as separate sanitary sewers only in which rainwater from roofs, streets and other areas and groundwater from foundation drains are excluded. Overflows from sanitary sewers to storm sewers are not permitted. 
                  7.2.3 Sizing factors. 
                  1)  The sanitary sewer system should be designed for the estimated ultimate tributary population. Tributary population is considered to be all areas upstream of the discharge point of the system being designed. Sewers will be designed and installed to the uppermost property line of the development being served. Consideration should be given to the maximum anticipated capacity of institutions, industrial parks, etc. 
                  2)  In determining the required capacities of sanitary sewers, the following factors should be considered: 1) maximum hourly sewage flow; 2) additional maximum sewage or waste flow from industrial plants; 3) ground water infiltration; 4) topography of the area; and 5) depth of excavation. 
                  3)  New sanitary sewer systems shall be designed on the basis of an average daily flow of sewage of not less than 400 gallons per household per day. Normally all sanitary sewers shall be designed with a peaking factor of not less than four and this may be increased as required by the department. Peak factors will be higher for smaller basins. Sanitary sewers should be designed to carry the peak flow when flowing at a depth of 2/3 -pipe diameter. When deviation from the foregoing per capita rates are demonstrated, a description of the procedure used for design shall be included. 
                  No sewer main shall be less than eight inches and no service lateral shall be less than six inches. 
                  7.2.4 Depth requirements. 
                  1)  Any sewers installed in the street shall be sufficiently deep to provide six feet of cover at the inlet end of all service laterals at the street right-of-way, and over any part of the main or service within the street right-of-way. 
                  2)  Any sewers on off-street easements shall have a minimum of four feet of cover. In extraordinary circumstances where there is no other alternative, ductile iron pipe shall be used where there is less than six feet of cover. Filling over the pipe to obtain minimum cover is not allowed, if the fill will impede the natural flow of surface water or will cause an erosion problem. 
                  7.2.5 Slope. 
                  1)  All sewers shall be so designed and constructed to give mean velocities, when flowing full, of not less than two feet per second based on Manning's Formula using an "n" value of 0.013. The following are the minimum slopes that should be provided; however, slopes greater than these are desirable (see following page): 
                  Minimum Slope In Feet 

                   
                  2)  These minimum slopes will be used only when sufficient flows are expected to maintain a velocity of two feet per second and maintain a cleansing action in the line. Sewers shall be laid with uniform slope between manholes. Sewers on 15 percent slope or greater shall be ductile iron pipe and shall be anchored securely with concrete anchors to prevent displacement by erosion or shock. Maximum slope of sewers shall be 20 percent and sewers shall be designed at less than 15 percent whenever possible. 
                  7.2.6 Increasing size. When a small sewer is connected to a larger one, the connection shall be made by matching the crowns of both sewers to same elevation. 
                  7.2.7 Ductile iron pipe. 
                  1)  Ductile iron pipe shall be required for sanitary sewer mains: 
                  (a)  Over or under all storm sewers. 
                  (b)  Crossing water mains. 
                  (c)  Under all stream crossings. 
                  (d)  With less than six feet of cover or over 18 feet of cover. 
                  (e)  With 15 percent or greater slope. 
                  (f)  Inside casings. 
                  (g)  At all other locations specified by the department. 
                  7.2.8 Sanitary sewer pipe material requirements. The department reserves the right to disallow any manufacturer that does not have a consistent, long-term record of quality control and successful product performance. Acceptable sanitary sewer pipe materials include Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC), Ductile Iron Pipe (D.I.P), and Steel Pipe and Reinforced Concrete Pipe (R.C.P.). Ductile Iron Pipe shall be used where certain conditions exist. This should be addressed at the preliminary review stage. 
                  7.2.9 Subgrade and pipe bedding. All D.I.P., Steel or R.C.P. pipe shall have a minimum of Class "C" bedding. All PVC pipe shall have a minimum of Class "B" bedding. Wherever water or wet soil is encountered, Class "B" bedding shall be provided. If specifically designated on the plans, Class "A" or "B" bedding may be required. Typically the manufacturer's recommendations shall govern the bedding requirements of the various pipes at the varying depths. However, the department reserves the right to increase the bedding requirements for any sewer main where the department believes the manufacturer's recommendations are not sufficient. 
                  7.2.10 Manholes. 
                  1)  Manholes shall be installed at the end of each line; all changes in grade, size, or alignment; at all intersections; and at distances not greater than 400 feet. In no circumstances will a spacing of greater than 300 feet be allowed when the slope exceeds ten percent. Cleanouts may be used only for service laterals and special conditions and shall not be substituted for manholes. Manholes in cross-country areas shall be elevated so that the top is 18 inches above grade, with bolt down ceiling lids and a vent pipe extending above the 100-year flood elevation. 
                  2)  A drop pipe shall be provided for a sewer entering a manhole at an elevation of more than two feet above the manhole invert. Drop manholes shall be constructed in accordance with the standard details. The drop pipe shall be of ductile iron materials with mechanical joints. Also, at least one piece of ductile iron pipe shall be used on the incoming line to reach a solid, unexcavated foundation. All outside 90 degree elbows shall have thrust block poured below the elbow. Outside drop manholes will be noted on the construction plans. Where the difference in elevation between the incoming sanitary sewer and the manhole invert is less than two feet, the invert shall be row back brick, sloped from invert to invert to prevent solids deposition. 
                  3)  The flow channel through manholes should be made to conform in shape and slope to that of the sewers. Minimum drop through a manhole should be 0.1 feet. Precast inverts shall not be used. 
                  7.2.11 Protection of water supply. 
                  1)  There shall be no physical cross-connection between a public or private potable water supply system and a sanitary sewer that would permit the passage of any sewage or polluted water into the potable supply. 
                  2)  A horizontal separation of at least ten feet is required between sanitary sewer lines and existing or proposed water mains (measured edge to edge). Should conditions prevent a separation of ten feet, the lines shall be laid in separate trenches and sanitary sewers shall be ductile iron. Where sewer mains cross existing or proposed water lines, an 18-inch vertical separation is required between the two mains (measured edge to edge). 
                  3)  Wherever possible, the elevation of the crown of the sewer shall be at least 18 inches below the invert of the water main. The two pipes shall be installed such that a full length of pipe will be centered over the crossing so that all joints will be separated as much as possible. Ductile iron pipe shall be installed for both mains at points where the two lines cross. 
                  4)  When sewers are laid within public streets, the manholes and lines shall normally be laid along the center of the street at a depth of not less than seven feet below the road surface to the top of the pipe so that service laterals will have six feet of cover at the edge of the right-of-way. In curves and other areas where this is not possible, the lines and manholes are to be installed within the confines of the curb to avoid conflict with the curb and other utilities. Ductile iron pipe shall be used for sewer lines crossing storm sewers and at other locations specified by the department. 
                  7.2.12 Service laterals. 
                  1)  A sewer service shall be provided for every existing or proposed lot or building. All services shall be shown on the construction plans. All service laterals shall be a minimum of six inches in diameter. A common service shall not be allowed for two or more buildings. The service shall extend to five feet inside the property line of the lot being served and normally be within ten feet of the lower corner of the lot. The contractor shall install a cleanout at the right-of-way and extend the PVC cleanout to a height of three foot above the finished grade. The contractor shall also place a four inches x four inches pre-treated wood post painted green above the end of the service lateral to enable the builder to locate the service. All service laterals shall have six feet of cover at the right-of-way. Where such cover cannot be achieved, services shall be ductile iron. 
                  2)  Six inch services shall be laid at a minimum grade of one percent. Service laterals tied directly to manholes shall enter the manholes through cored holes and shall be provided with a pre-molded rubber boot as described in this article. Laterals shall enter the manhole no higher than six inches above the table and shall be provided with a concrete flume to slope the flow into the manhole invert. 
                  3)  The developer shall be responsible for serving all lots developed. On any lot where the service cannot be found, the developer shall be responsible for payment of the cost of installation of another service lateral. Also, unless noted on the final plat, the service shall be low enough to serve the first floor elevation at the building line. The builder shall be responsible for the location of services prior to the pouring of the foundation, driveway or other appurtenance. The department will not be responsible for any house built too low to be served nor for any service covered by construction. 
                  4)  No plumber or contractor will be allowed to connect to the sewerage system except to the end of the service provided for such connection, when proper permit is issued. After the service is run from the end of the lateral provided by the sewer line contractor to the house plumbing, the cleanout at the right-of-way may be cut down to a level six inches below the finished grade. The cleanout shall be provided with a cast iron ferrule with a brass screw plug to enable the cleanout to be located with a metal detector. Plastic plugs are not allowed. 
                  7.2.13 Provisions for future extensions. 
                  1)  Where the developer does not contemplate installation of sewers to the most upstream property line of drainage basins running through the development, a 20-foot wide permanent easement and 60-foot wide construction easement shall be required for future use of the department. These easements must be shown and recorded on the final plat. 
                  2)  Sanitary sewer lines must end at a manhole. Stubbing out sewer lines for future extensions without placing a manhole cover at the end of the sewer line is not allowed. 
                  7.2.14 Sanitary sewer line extension requirements. If an existing trunk line must be extended to serve the property, the developer may be required to pay all of the initial costs. If the line extension would serve other developments within a one-year period, the department may negotiate with the initial developer for a pro rata share participation from future developers who wish to connect to the extension during the one-year period. 
                  7.2.15 Air and vacuum relief valve assemblies. A and V assemblies shall be located along sewer force mains where appropriate as determined by a design professional in responsible charge of the sanitary sewer system design. All A and V assembly locations are subject to the approval of the department. 
                  7.2.16 Polyethylene encasement. Ductile iron pipe shall be provided with polyethylene encasement whenever the sewer line either crosses or is in close proximity to a steel gas main. 
                  7.2.17 Easements. 
                  1)  Easements for sanitary sewer lines and drainage purposes may be combined, but must be a minimum of 30 feet wide if designated for combination. 
                  2)  Sewer easements off the street right-of-way shall be clearly defined on the plat of the individual property owner and said property owner will be required to keep the easement free of all obstructions. 
                  3)  All easements shall be cleared of debris, excess dirt and other materials. The ground shall be smoothed down and grassed within ten days of completing construction work. The use of sediment control measures will be required to protect the area until a vegetative cover is obtained. 
                  4)  Where the developer does not contemplate installation of sewers to the most upstream property line of drainage basins running through the development, a 20-foot wide permanent easement and 60-foot wide construction easement will be required for future use of the county. These easements must be shown and recorded on the final plat. 
                  7.2.18 Joint restraint inside casing. Inside of casings, the sewer line joints shall be slip joint restrained by using U.S. Pipe "Field-Lok" gaskets or approved equal. 
                  7.2.19 Wastewater lift stations. Lift station design shall be done by a registered professional engineer licensed in the State of Georgia. The depth of the wet well shall determine whether a submersible or mounted pump is used. Wet wells for mounted pumps shall not exceed 15 feet in depth, subject to the design conditions and approval of the department. The following minimum requirements shall apply to wastewater lift stations: 
                  1)  General. 
                  (a)  Lift stations having less than 500 gpm capacity (per pump) shall utilize two pumps each having a capacity equal to the design flow. 
                  (b)  Lift stations having a capacity of 500 gpm or more shall be reviewed on an individual basis and may have requirements differing from those outlined herein. 
                  (c)  Grinder type centrifugal pumps will be used for pumps having a capacity of less than 100 gpm. Force mains shall be sized to provide a velocity of at least two feet per second. 
                  (d)  The design shall allow for easy removal of any pump or equipment item without the need for shut-down of the entire lift station. A lift assembly shall be provided for pump or equipment removal. 
                  (e)  The design engineer should consult the department after preliminary design data has been developed for information on approved pump manufacturers. The department reserves the right to review each application on an individual basis and to reject the use of nonapproved manufacturers. 
                  2)  Submittals. 
                  (a)  Submittal of construction plans shall include the following lift station information: 
                  i.  Capacity calculations. Use one gpm capacity per house on residential developments of less than 200 units, except that the minimum pump capacity shall be 30 gpm. 
                  ii.  System head calculations, tabulated and plotted on the pump curve. Include a plot of force main velocity. 
                  iii.  Construction drawings, details and specifications in sufficient detail to ascertain compliance with these regulations. 
                  iv.  Cycle time. Calculations showing determination of wet well volume and cycle time at design conditions. Wet well volume should be sufficient to provide a cycle time of no less than five minutes from a pump "on" to next pump "on" time. 
                  v.  Storage volume. Calculations showing volume of storage available in the even of a power outage. The storage zone shall be delineated on plan and profile drawings of the sanitary sewer system (see the subsection below on "standby power"). 
                  vi.  Buoyancy computations showing that structures are protected against flotation. 
                  (b)  After construction plan approval, but before purchasing any lift station equipment, shop drawings shall be submitted containing the following information: 
                  i.  Manufacturer's catalog sheets, performance curves, installation drawings, specifications and list of options for the specific pump that is offered for approval. 
                  ii.  Similar catalog data for controls, valves, hatches, yard hydrants, precast wet well and other manufactured items. 
                  (c)  After installation and before placing the system into full operation, the work must be inspected by the developer's engineer, who must then issue a certification to the department verifying that all work has been completed in accordance with approved plans. This certification shall include all construction of the lift station and force main. After acceptance of the work by the engineer, a factory representative shall inspect and start up the system certifying rotation, capacity, amperage draw, lack of vibration and other standard check points. This certification shall state the beginning date of the warranty and include a copy of the warranty. 
                  (d)  On or before the date of start-up, five sets of Factory O and M Manuals shall be delivered to the department. These shall include the name of the purchaser, the serial numbers of pumps, detailed wiring schematics, telephone number and address for purchase of parts. 
                  (e)  After construction is complete, as-built drawings shall be furnished including one set of mylar sepias plus four sets of prints. 
                  3)  Spare parts—per manufacturer's recommendations. 
                  Lift stations shall be supplied with a spare complete pump, an extra impeller, set of bearings and a complete set of manufacturer's recommended spare parts. 
                  4)  Standby power. 
                  (a)  The minimum requirement for standby power for lift stations shall be that each station that does not have a permanent in-place generator shall have installed a manual transfer switch and receptacle for quick connection of a portable generator. 
                  (b)  The need for providing a permanent in-place generator will be determined on the basis of storage time in the sanitary sewers leading to the pump station. If the storage time is less than 12 hours then a permanent generator must be installed. If storage time equals 12 hours or more only a transfer switch and provisions for connecting to a portable generator will be required. The following rules shall apply: 
                  i.  Storage volume available shall be taken as the volume between the low water level in the wet well and the elevation at which overflow would first occur (this might be the top of the wet well or that upstream manhole having the lowest top elevation). Volume of the wet well, manholes and sanitary sewer mains will be counted. 
                  ii.  The rate of sewage inflow for these computations shall be taken as 150 gallons per day per residential unit. Systems serving other than residential customers will be considered individually. 
                  iii.  Height of manholes shall not be extended above normal for the purpose of meeting this rule. The design shall ensure overflow before backing sewage into a dwelling or other building. 
                  (c)  When required, emergency power will be supplied by an on-site emergency generator. The generator shall be diesel powered with an automatic transfer switch and provisions for an automatic exercise cycle. Specifications for the generator shall be submitted to the department for approval. 
                  5)  Site requirements. 
                  (a)  Flooding. Lift stations shall remain fully operational and accessible during the 25-year flood. All electrical controls shall be above the 100-year flood level. All motors and mechanical equipment shall be protected against physical damage from the 100-year flood. 
                  (b)  Access road. Access roads shall be paved with a 12-foot wide surface of either concrete (six-inches thick with wire mesh) or asphalt (six-inches graded aggregate base plus two inches Type E asphalt). Maximum grade shall be 20 percent. Where access road lengths exceed 350 feet, six inches graded aggregate base may be used in lieu of a paved driveway. In cases where gravel driveways are utilized, the maximum grade shall be ten percent. 
                  (c)  Ownership. Both the lift station and the access road right-of-way shall have fee simple ownership dedicated to the county, and this shall be indicated on the subdivision plat. The dedicated space for the lift station shall include sufficient space for parking two trucks, plus turn-around, plus slope maintenance. The dedicated width on road right-of-way shall be 40 feet minimum. 
                  (d)  Fencing. Lift station sites shall be fenced with a minimum of six-foot high chain link fencing topped with three strands of barbed wire. Access gates shall be a minimum of 15 feet in width. The space inside the fencing shall be large enough to facilitate service vehicle access to the pumping station whenever the access road length exceeds 200 feet or when the road grade exceeds ten percent. 
                  (e)  Water supply. A metered water supply line (one-inch minimum size) shall be installed to the site, with the meter placed on the outside of the fencing. Inside the fence, in an insulated, vented, above ground enclosure, a pressure reducing valve shall be placed in the water main, followed by a reduced pressure zone back flow preventer with by-pass. Beyond the enclosure, a freeze-proof yard hydrant (Murdock BFHM-100 or approved equal) shall be installed near the wet well. The hydrant shall be equipped with a suitable backflow preventer (Watts No. NF8 or approved equal). 
                  (f)  Lighting. One pole-mounted, photo cell controlled, 150-watt mercury vapor security light shall be installed. It shall be equipped with a manual on/off switch (located in the main control panel) to override the photo cell control. 
                  (g)  Screening. Where natural screening is not present to screen the site from view of residences, special plantings shall be installed to screen the site. 
                  (h)  Ground covers. All unpaved ground areas inside the fence and extending four feet beyond the fence shall be treated with a herbicide and covered with a geotextile fabric, followed with a four inch layer of no. 57 stone. The geotextile fabric shall be a nonwoven polypropylene weighing eight ounces per square yard with a minimum burst strength of 250 p.s.i., such as Amoco Type 4553 or equal. 
                  6)  Design features. 
                  (a)  Wet well volume. The wet well volume shall be sized to limit pump cycles to no more than six cycles per hour under worst conditions. 
                  (b)  Ventilation. For wet wells, the minimum requirement shall be two-gravity vent pipes designed for natural ventilation. Vents shall be elevated to a minimum of two feet above the 100-year flood plain. Where conditions are conducive to formation of hazardous conditions (in the design engineer's opinion), then mechanical ventilation shall be provided. For dry wells, mechanical ventilation shall be required. 
                  (c)  Structures. Submersible lift stations shall have a wet well structure and a separate valve pit. Both structures shall be precast concrete with a monolithic base. The valve pit shall be a minimum of four foot x four foot x five foot deep with an aluminum ladder, and provided with a floor drain pipe, and a three foot x three foot lockable aluminum access hatch. Wet wells may be either round or rectangular and shall have a diameter or width of at least five feet. Wet wells shall be sized to meet cycle time requirements with a drawdown (i.e., the distance between high water level and low water level) of not more than three feet.

                  1)  It shall be expressly understood that these regulations are for installation of all sanitary sewer mains and appurtenances. 
                  2)  All work shall conform to the applicable provisions of specifications prepared by the AWWA, ANSI and ASTM of latest revision, except as otherwise specified herein. 
                  3)  Compliance with applicable safety regulations is the responsibility of each company engaged in the work. The department assumes no responsibility for the actions of others on the job site. It is the responsibility of those installing sanitary sewer lines and appurtenances to conform to OSHA regulations. 
                  7.4.2 Trench and manhole excavation. 
                  1)  Sanitary sewer lines shall normally be installed by open-cut trench excavation. Pipe trenches shall be excavated straight and true to grade and line and in the location shown on the plans. Trenches shall be dug so that the pipe can be laid to the alignment and depth required, and the trench shall be of such width and shall be braced and drained so that the workmen may work therein safely and efficiently. Chocking under the pipe will not be permitted. All joints shall be as specified herein. Excavation must be made under the bell of each pipe so that the entire length of the pipe will lie uniformly on the bottom of the trench and the pipe weight shall not rest on the bells. Trenches shall be free of water during the work. 
                  (a)  Trenches shall have a minimum width of 12 inches plus the diameter of the outside of the bell of the sewer main and the maximum trench width at the centerline of the pipe shall not be more than the nominal diameter of the pipe plus two feet. In unpaved areas, the trenches may have a greater width that this, beginning at one foot above the top of the pipe and extending to the ground surface, if such width is necessary or desirable. However, in paved areas, the width of the trench from top to bottom shall not exceed the nominal diameter of the pipe plus two feet. 
                  (b)  In cases where water mains cross above sanitary sewers, there shall be a minimum clearance of 18 inches vertical separation between the water and sewer mains. In cases where a sanitary sewer crosses above a water main, there shall be a minimum clearance of 18 inches vertical separation between the mains, plus the sanitary sewer main shall be encased in concrete. Both mains shall be ductile iron pipe. At crossings, one full length of sewer pipe must be located so that both joints are as far from the water main as possible. In cases where sanitary sewer mains parallel water mains, there shall be a minimum of ten feet horizontal separation maintained between the mains. These distances are measured edge to edge. 
                  (c)  No excavation shall be made under highways, streets, alleys or private property until satisfactory arrangements have been made with the state, city, county or owners of the property to be crossed. All excavated material shall be placed so as to not interfere with public travel on the streets and highways along which the lines are laid. Not more than 100 feet of trench shall be opened on any line in advance of pipe laying. 
                  (d)  When possible, all crossings of paved highways or driveways by pipe line shall be made by boring or jacking the pipe under the pavement and shall be done in such manner as not to damage the pavement or foundation, unless the casing or pipe is in solid rock, in which case the crossing shall be made by the open cut method or by tunneling. 
                  (e)  Wherever streets, roads or driveways are cut, they shall be immediately backfilled and compacted after the pipe is laid and shall be maintained in first-class condition as passable at all times until repaved. 
                  (f)  Backfilling, compaction, dressing and clean-up shall be kept as close to the line laying crew as is practical, and negligence in this feature of the work will not be tolerated. 
                  (g)  In excavation and backfilling and laying pipe, care must be taken not to remove or injure any water, sewer, gas or other pipes, conduits or other structures without permission from the department. When an obstruction is encountered, the contractor shall notify the designer who will have the owner of the obstruction adjust same or make necessary changes in grade and/or alignment to avoid such obstruction. Any house connection, drains or other structures damaged by the contractor shall be repaired or replaced immediately. 
                  (h)  All excavation materials shall be placed on one side of the trench, unless permission is given by the department to place it on both sides. Excavation materials shall be so placed as not to endanger the work and so that free access may be had at all times to all parts of the trench and to all fire hydrants or water valve boxes, etc. All shade trees, shrubs, etc., shall be protected. 
                  (i)  The excavation for manholes shall extend to a firm, acceptable foundation and leave not less than 24 inches in the clear between their exterior surface and the embankment or retaining structure that may be used to protect it. 
                  (j)  The contractor shall furnish, install and maintain such sheathing, bracing, etc., as may be required to support the sides of the excavation and to prevent any movement that might injure the pipe, or cause sloughing of the street or trench, or otherwise injure or delay the work or interfere with adjoining structures. 
                  (k)  Construction occurring around active sanitary sewerage systems shall be done in such a way so as to prevent the spillage of sewage. 
                  2)  All materials shall be considered as rock which cannot be excavated except by drilling, blasting or wedging. It shall consist of undecomposed stone in solid layers or of boulders of not less than one-half cubic yard. Wherever rock is encountered in the excavation, it shall be removed by suitable means. If blasting is used for removal of rock, the contractor shall take all proper safety precautions. He shall comply with all rules and regulations for the protection of life and property that may be imposed by any public body having jurisdiction relative to the handling, storing and use of explosives. He is fully responsible for filing for and acquiring any blasting permits that may be required by those agencies having jurisdiction. Before blasting, the contractor shall cover the excavation with heavy timbers and mats in such a manner as to prevent damage to persons or the adjacent property. Rock excavation near existing pipelines or other structures shall be conducted with the utmost care to avoid damage. The contractor shall be wholly responsible for any damage resulting from blasting, and any injury or damage to structures or property shall be promptly repaired by the contractor to the satisfaction of the department and property owner. 
                  3)  Rocks in trenches shall be excavated over the horizontal limits of excavation and to depths as follows: 

                   
                  (a)  The undercut space shall then be brought up to grade by backfilling with subgrade stabilizer stone. 
                  (b)  In rock excavation, the backfill from the bottom of the trench to one foot above the top of the pipe shall be finely pulverized soil, free from rocks and stones. The rest of the backfill shall not contain over 75 percent broken stone, and the maximum sized stone placed in the trench shall not weigh over 50 pounds. Excess rock and fragments of rock weighing more than 50 pounds shall be loaded and hauled to disposal. If it is necessary, in order to comply with these specifications, selected backfill shall be borrowed and hauled to the trenches in rock excavation. 
                  (c)  Sides of the trench shall be trimmed of projecting rock that will interfere with backfilling operations. Rock excavation by blasting shall be at least 75 feet in advance of pipe laying. 
                  7.4.3 Installation of sanitary sewer. 
                  1)  Construction stake-out will be required prior to construction of sanitary sewer lines. At a minimum, the horizontal alignment will be staked at 100-foot intervals and each manhole will be located with a centerline stake and two offset hubs. "Cuts" to invert elevations will be shown for each manhole entry and exit pipe. A copy of the stake-out notes will be provided by the department. 
                  2)  Pipe and accessories shall at all times be handled with care to avoid damage. Whether moved by hand, skidways or hoists, material shall not be dropped or bumped. The interior of all pipe shall be kept free from dirt and foreign matter at all times. Each joint of pipe shall be unloaded opposite or near the place where it is to be laid in the trench. All such material that is defective in manufacture or has been damaged in transit or after delivery shall be removed from the job site. 
                  3)  All pipe and appurtenances shall be of the dimensions and laid to the line and grade as shown on the plans and as established by the design professional and as approved by the department. Wyes and/or service connections and stubs from manholes shall be placed where shown on plans and as approved by the department. All such connections shall be blanked off with suitable stopper and made watertight with jute and cement mortar. 
                  4)  The preferred order of construction is to connect to existing sanitary sewers after all other construction is complete and conditionally accepted by the department. Connections to existing sanitary sewers can be done at the beginning of construction; however, the new main shall be plugged where it enters either the existing manhole or the new doghouse manhole over an existing sanitary sewer, and the plug shall remain in place until the project is conditionally accepted. 
                  5)  Sanitary sewer pipes shall be joined by "push-on" joints using elastomeric gaskets to affect the pressure seal. The ends of pipe to be joined and the gaskets shall be cleaned immediately before assembly, and the assembly shall be made as recommended by the pipe manufacturer. Lubricant used must be nontoxic and supplied or approved for use by the manufacturer. Sanitary sewer pipes shall be laid in the uphill direction with the bells pointing upgrade. Any variation from this procedure shall require approval from the department. 
                  6)  Bell holes shall be provided of sufficient size to allow ample room for making the pipe joints without putting any load on the bell of the pipe. The bottom of the trench between bell holes shall be carefully graded so that the pipe barrel will rest on a solid foundation for its entire length as shown on the plans. Pipe shall be laid with joints close and even, butting all around, so that it will form a close concentric joint with adjoining pipe with no sagging at the hub and so that a true surface is given to the invert throughout the entire length of the sewers. After the pipe is laid, backfilling shall be completed as directed in these regulations. 
                  7)  The contractor shall be required to provide and operate any equipment necessary to keep the trenches free from water while pipe is being laid and the joints made. The installed pipe shall not be used for draining water from the ditch. 
                  8)  Pipe grades shall be obtained by use of a laser and double-checked with a surveying level and rod. 
                  9)  Completed sewers shall be tested between manholes with lanterns or reflected light and shall show the full circle of the pipe from manhole to manhole without obstruction. 
                  10)  Sewers shall be laid tight and the rate of infiltration in any section of line between adjacent manholes shall not exceed 100 G.P.D. per inch diameter of pipe per mile of line when the trenches are saturated with water. 
                  All openings along the line of the sewers shall be securely closed at night, during suspension of work, and at the end of each work period, with a water-tight stopper. 
                  No length of pipe shall be laid until one preceding it shall have sufficient quantity of fine earth tamped around it to hold it firmly in place. 
                  7.4.4 Making of joints. When joining gravity sewer pipe, both the spigot end and the bell end of the pipe shall be perfectly clean and free from dirt, oil, grease or other foreign matter. The spigot end shall be lightly coated with the lubricant recommended and furnished by the manufacturer, and the pipe then shall be securely and firmly seated in the bell end of the adjoining pipe. In making the joint, the spigot end of the pipe, after being cleaned and coated with lubricant, shall not be allowed to touch the sides or bottom of the trench before being inserted in the bell end of the adjoining pipe. In addition to the above, joints shall be made in strict accordance with the specifications and recommendations of the manufacturer. 
                  7.4.5 Subgrade and pipe bedding. 
                  1)  All D.I.P. or R.C.P. pipe shall have a minimum of Class "C" bedding. All PVC pipe shall have a minimum bedding as described below and shown in the standard details. Wherever water or wet soil is encountered, Class "B" bedding shall be provided for D.I.P. or R.C.P. If specifically designated on the plans, Class "A" or "B" bedding may be required. 
                  2)  A description of Class "A," "B," and "C" bedding is as follows: 
                  (a)  Class "A" bedding. Class "A" bedding refers to bedding with concrete cradle, arch or encasement. The contractor shall conform to details show in the detailed drawings when Class "A" bedding is required. 
                  (b)  Class "B" bedding. The pipe shall be bedded in crushed granite material, conforming to the section of these regulations on "Subgrade Stabilizer Stone," or other suitable materials approved by the department. The bedding shall be placed on a flat trench bottom with a minimum thickness beneath the pipe of one-eighth the outside pipe diameter, but not less than six inches (150 mm) and sliced under the haunches of the pipe with a shovel or other suitable tool to height of one-half the outside pipe diameter, or to the horizontal centerline. The initial backfill shall be hand placed to a level of 12 inches (300 mm) over the top of the pipe and shall consist of finely divided materials free from debris, organic material and large rocks or stones. 
                  (c)  Class "C" bedding. The pipe shall be bedded in subgrade stabilizer stone placed on a flat trench bottom. The bedding material shall have a minimum thickness beneath the pipe of six inches (150 mm) or one-eighth of the outside diameter of the pipe, whichever is greater, and sliced under the haunches of the pipe with a shovel or other suitable tool to a height of one-sixth the outside diameter of the pipe. The initial backfill shall be hand placed to a level of 12 inches (300 mm) over the top of the pipe and shall consist of finely divided materials free from debris, organic material and large rocks or stones. Bedding materials shall be as described in the section of these regulations on "Subgrade Stabilizer Stone." 
                  (d)  Special bedding for PVC pipe. The pipe shall be bedded in crushed granite material, conforming to the section of these regulations on "Subgrade Stabilizer Stone," or other materials approved by the department. The bedding shall be placed on a flat trench bottom with a minimum thickness beneath the pipe of one-fourth the outside pipe diameter, but not less than six (6) inches (150 mm) and sliced under the haunches of the pipe with a shovel or other suitable tool to height of two-thirds the outside pipe diameter. The initial backfill shall be hand placed to a level of 12 inches (300 mm) over the top of the pipe and shall consist of finely divided materials free from debris, organic material and large rocks or stones. 
                  7.4.6 Dewatering trenches. The contractor shall do all necessary pumping or bailing, build all drains and do all other work necessary at his own expense to keep the trenches clear of water during the progress of the work. No structure shall be built or pipe shall be laid in water, and water shall not be allowed to flow over or rise upon any concrete, masonry or pipe until the same has been inspected and the concrete or joint material has thoroughly set. All water pumped, bailed or otherwise removed from the trench or other excavation shall be conveyed in a proper manner to a suitable place of discharge where it will not cause injury to the public health or to public or private property or to work completed or in progress, or to the surface of the streets or cause any interference with the use of same by the public. 
                  7.4.7 Backfilling. 
                  1)  After the pipe has been laid, backfilling shall be done in two distinct operations. In general, all backfill beneath, around and to a depth of 12 inches above the top of the pipe shall be placed by hand in four inch layers for the full width of the trench and thoroughly compacted by hand with vibratory equipment. The remainder of the backfill shall be placed in six inch layers and compacted to the top of the trench, either by pneumatic had tamps, hydro-tamps, or other approved methods. Care shall be taken so that the pipe is not laterally displaced during backfilling operations. The backfill lifts shall be placed by an approved method in accordance with that hereinafter specified. Backfill materials shall be the excavated materials without bricks, stone, foreign matter or corrosive materials, where not otherwise specified or indicated on the plans. 
                  2)  Backfill under permanent concrete or bituminous pavement and as elsewhere specified or indicated on the plans shall be approved bank-run sand or gravel or crushed stone free from large stones and containing not more than ten percent by weight of loam or clay. This backfill shall be compacted to 100 percent as determined by the Modified Proctor test for the top two feet of trench and 95 percent by the Modified Proctor test from pipe bedding to two feet below trench top. Mechanical vibrating equipment shall be used to achieve the required compaction. Pavement shall be replaced immediately after the backfilling operation is completed. 
                  3)  Backfill under gravel or crushed stone surfaced roadways shall be the approved suitable excavated material placed in six inch layers thoroughly compacted for the full depth and width of the trench, conforming to the compaction, density compaction method and materials as specified in the immediately preceding paragraph. 
                  4)  Backfill in unpaved areas shall be compacted with mechanical vibrating equipment to 90 percent as determined by the Modified Proctor test. Backfill material from pipe bedding to ground surface shall be excavated earth free from large stones and other debris. 
                  5)  The contractor shall fully restore and replace all pavement, sidewalks, landscapes, surface structures, etc., removed or disturbed as part of the work to a condition equal to or better than before the work began to the satisfaction of the department. 
                  6)  Where sheeting is used in connection with the work, it is in no case to be withdrawn before the trench is sufficiently filled to prevent damage to banks, road surfaces, adjacent pipes, adjacent structures or adjacent property, public or private. 
                  7.4.8 Stream crossings. 
                  1)  The preferred method of crossing a river, stream, creek impoundment or wet weather ditch is with a minimum of two feet of cover between the lowest point in the stream and the top of outside diameter of the pipe. Ductile iron pipe is required for all stream crossings and shall extend a minimum of ten feet beyond the top of the bank on each side. Concrete collars or encasement must be provided at all joints for ductile iron pipe with less than three feet of cover. 
                  2)  The stream bed and banks at the crossing site shall be protected from erosion with the use of rip-rap, as defined and sized in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia, Appendix C (Construction Materials), most current edition. 
                  3)  Aerial crossings will require detailed plans and will be allowed only when, in the department's opinion, there is no reasonable alternative. 
                  4)  Erosion control measures shall be installed prior to installing pipe across any stream. All work should be performed when stream flows are at their lowest, and all work should be performed as quickly and safely as possible. As soon as conditions permit, the stream bed shall be cleared of all falsework, debris, and other obstructions placed therein or caused by the construction operations. 
                  5)  Erosion control measures can include, but are not limited to, the following items: a) silt fencing, types a, b and/or c; b) erosion control check dams; c) channel diversion through temporary storm drain pipe; and d) rock filter dams. The construction and installation of these various structures are detailed in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia or the Georgia D.O.T. Standards and Construction Details, both of which are available for purchase to the contractor. 
                  7.4.9 Casing for sanitary sewers. 
                  1)  Where pipe is required to be installed under railroads, highways, streets or other facilities by jacking or boring methods, construction shall be done in a manner that will not interfere with the operation of the utility, and shall not weaken the roadbed or structure. 
                  2)  Casing pipe shall be installed at the locations shown on the plans. Unless directed otherwise, the installation procedure shall be the dry bore method. The hole is to be mechanically bored and cased through the soil by a cutting head on a continuous auger mounted inside the casing pipe. The installation of the casing and boring of the hole shall be done simultaneously by jacking. The diameter of the bore shall conform to the outside diameter and circumference of the casing pipe as closely as practical. Any voids that develop during the installation operation shall be pressure grouted. Each segment of the casing pipe shall be welded (full circumference butt weld) to the adjoining segment. The completed casing shall have no sags or crowns that cause the grade for any segment to be less than the minimum slope for the size pipe being installed. 
                  3)  Excavation material will be removed and placed at the top of the working pit. Backfill material and methods of backfilling and tamping shall be as previously outlined in this article. Carrier pipe shall be D.I.P. and shall be inserted within the casing by use of approved casing spacers. Inside of casings, the sewer main joints shall be slip joint restrained by using U.S. Pipe "Field-Lok" gaskets or approved equal. 
                  4)  The annular space between the carrier pipe and the casing shall be pressure grouted after the carrier pipe is sufficiently secured on grade to prevent floating during grouting. The carrier pipe should be filled with water prior to grouting to aid in the prevention of floating. At each end of the casing pipe, the void between the carrier pipe and casing shall be sealed with brick and mortar. 
                  7.4.10 Sewer service laterals. 
                  1)  A sewer service shall be provided for every existing or proposed lot or building. All services must be shown on the construction drawings. All service laterals shall be minimum of six inches in diameter. A common service shall not be allowed for two or more buildings. The service shall extend to the property line of the lot being served and normally be within ten feet of the lower corner of the lot. The contractor shall install a cleanout at the right-of-way and extend the PVC cleanout to a height of three feet above the finished grade. The contractor shall also place a four-inch x four-inch pre-treated wood post painted green above the end of the service lateral to enable the builder to locate the service. All service laterals shall have six feet of cover at the right-of-way. Where six feet of cover cannot be achieved, services shall be ductile iron. 
                  2)  Six-inch services shall be laid at a minimum grade of one percent. Service laterals tied directly to manholes shall enter the manholes through cored holes and shall be provided with a pre-molded rubber boot. Laterals shall enter the manhole no higher than six inches above the table and shall be provided with a concrete flume to slope the flow into the manhole invert. 
                  3)  The developer shall be responsible for serving all lots developed. On any lot where the service cannot be found, the developer shall be responsible for payment of the cost of installation of another service lateral. Also, unless noted on the final plat, the service shall be low enough to serve the first floor elevation at the building line. The builder shall be responsible for the location of the services prior to the pouring of the foundation, driveway or other appurtenances. The department will not be responsible for any house built too low to be served nor for any service covered by construction. 
                  4)  No plumber or contractor will be allowed to connect to the sewerage system except to the end of the service provided for this connection, when proper permit is issued. After the service is run from the end of the lateral provided by the sewer line contractor to the house plumbing, the cleanout at the right-of-way may be cut down to a level six inches below the finished grade. The cleanout shall be provided with a cast iron ferrule with a brass screw plug to enable the cleanout to be located with a metal detector. Plastic plugs are not allowed. 
                  7.4.11 Setting fittings on force mains. 
                  1)  Fittings shall be placed where shown on the plans. Fittings shall be properly braced to ensure that they will not be blown off or broken loose under the greatest possible force of the sewage flow. All fittings shall be mechanical joint with retainer glands unless specified otherwise. In situations where there is insufficient undisturbed earth to act as a bearing surface or where otherwise directed by the department, fittings shall be restrained by the use of threaded rods or other method acceptable to the department. 
                  2)  Prior to blocking any joint or fitting with concrete, that joint or fitting shall be wrapped with polyethylene film in such a manner that the concrete will not stick directly to the pipe but that the load bearing capacity of the blocking will not be affected. 
                  7.4.12 Bracing, sheeting and/or shoring. Whenever the condition of the ground is such that it is necessary to protect the work, the street, the roadway or the workmen, the sides of the trench shall be supported with suitable bracing, sheeting and/or shoring to be furnished by the contractor at his own expense. 
                  7.4.13 Location and protection of existing underground utilities. It is the responsibility of the contractor to locate the underground utilities and to protect same. Utility lines or services damaged by the contractor shall be repaired by the contractor at his own expense. 
                  7.4.14 Connection to Paulding County's Existing Sanitary Sewer System. 
                  1)  The developer's private contractor shall make all required connections to the county's sewer system. The department's inspectors will supervise the connection and all associated work. The contractor shall give the department a minimum of 48 hours' notice prior to any sewer system work. 
                  2)  The contractor will provide proper traffic control devices and certified personnel to direct traffic if required. 
                  3)  All connections to existing manholes shall be properly cored with a coring machine. "Knocking-out" of a hole in the manhole for a connection is not permitted. 
                  4)  The timing of the developer's connection to the county's system shall be pre-arranged with the department. 
                  7.4.15 Street cuts. 
                  1)  All paved roads will be bored and cased. A bore must be attempted before consideration will be given to cutting the street. 
                  2)  Existing roadways shall not be open cut unless permission is granted by the Georgia D.O.T. and/or the Paulding County Department of Transportation. Submittal of an authorization letter from the state D.O.T. or the county D.O.T. is required. 
                  3)  One lane of traffic shall be maintained open at all times. Construction work shall be limited to time between 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. 
                  4)  The contractor shall furnish traffic control devices and certified personnel to direct traffic, if required. 
                  5)  The above requirements may be altered with the written approval of the department in extenuating circumstances. 
                  6)  Assuming that a road bore has been attempted and failed, and that the contractor has received permission to open cut a road, pavement replacement shall adhere to the following guidelines: 
                  (a)  Removing and replacing pavement shall consist of removing the type of pavement and base encountered, and replacing same to its original shape, appearance and riding quality, in accordance with the detailed plans. Where possible, all pipe under existing paved driveways will be either free bored or installed in casing. Free bores under driveways will be made with ductile iron pipe. Casing will be required where the installation is under any roadway. Carrier pipe shall be ductile iron pipe. 
                  (b)  Concrete pavement shall be replaced with pavement of a thickness equal to that removed, or six inches for driveways and eight inches for roads, whichever is thicker. The concrete shall meet the specifications of the D.O.T. for concrete paving. 
                  (c)  Where bitumastic paving is replaced, a base course of 3,000 psi concrete shall be placed over the ditch line. The concrete shall be six inches thick for driveways and parking lots and eight inches thick for public roads. The top of this base course shall be left with a rough float finish 1½ inches below the surface of the existing paving. After the concrete has attained its strength, a tack coat of AC-15 or equal shall be applied at the rate of 0.25 gallons per square yard, and a plant mix surface course applied over this, and finished off level with existing pavement. 
                  (d)  Unless otherwise directed in writing, all pavement shall be removed to a width of the trench plus 12 inches on each side as shown on the detailed drawings. Under normal circumstances, the maximum allowable trench width shall be the nominal diameter of the pipe plus 24 inches. 
                  7.4.16 Standard detailed drawings. Installation of sewer mains, service laterals, manholes, casings, cleanouts, etc., shall be made in accordance with the standard detailed drawings in these regulations. 
                  7.4.17 Clean-up. 
                  1)  The contractor shall remove all unused materials, excess rock and earth, and all other debris from the construction site as closely behind the work as practicable. All trenches shall be backfilled and tamped before the end of each day's work. 
                  2)  Prior to requesting the final inspection, the contractor shall do the following: 
                  (a)  Remove and dispose of in an acceptable manner all shipping timbers, shipping bands, excess materials, broken material, crates, boxes and any other material brought to the job site. 
                  (b)  Repair or replace any work damaged by the sewer line construction. 
                  (c)  Regrade and smooth all shoulder areas disturbed by the sewer line construction. 
                  (d)  All easement areas shall be cleared of trees, stumps and other debris and left in a condition such that the easement can be maintained by bush-hog equipment. 
                  (e)  All shoulders, ditches, culverts and other areas impacted by the sanitary sewer construction shall be at the proper grades and smooth in appearance. 
                  (f)  All manhole covers shall be brought to grade. 
                  (g)  A uniform stand of grass or mulch for erosion protection, as defined in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is required over all construction easements and sanitary sewer easements prior to the department's acceptance of the sanitary sewer. 
                  7.4.18 Barricades. The contractor shall provide, erect and maintain all necessary barricades, suitable and sufficient red lights, danger signals and necessary precautions for the protection of the work and the safety of the public.

                  4)  It is the intent of these specifications to produce a stand of grass that is alive and growing, without any bare spots larger than one square foot. The contractor shall repeat all work, including any plowing, fertilizing, watering and seeding as necessary to produce a satisfactory stand. 
                  7.5 - Inspection and tests. 
                  7.5.1 General. 
                  1)  All lines designed to operate as gravity sanitary sewers and all force mains shall be successfully tested. Tests of installed piping shall be completed as described in the following sections. 
                  2)  All piping to be tested must satisfactorily comply with these tests before being eligible for acceptance. 
                  3)  These tests must be performed in the presence of the department's inspectors or designees in order for the test to be accepted as valid. 
                  7.5.2 Concealed work. The department's inspectors may direct that the contractor notify the department and receive inspection approval prior to concealing certain work such as manhole foundations, pipe bedding, wyes, bends, service laterals or other appurtenances. 
                  7.5.3 Minimum tests. All new gravity sewer lines constructed will be tested for infiltration, exfiltration and deflection. Flexible pipe sewers (PVC) shall be subjected to the Mandrel Test. The sewer lines may be televised if the department's inspectors cannot see through the line properly or suspects that the joints may be offset or broken. Force mains will be subjected to a pressure/leakage test. Slopes of sewer mains that are close to minimum grade will be checked to insure cleansing velocity. The department may require manholes to be subjected to a vacuum test to check potential infiltration. The backfill in the trench above the pipeline will be subjected to compaction tests as detailed below. Any defects located during testing must be corrected before construction of the project may proceed. All costs associated with testing will be paid by the developer. Tests will be performed as follows: 
                  1)  Measurement of infiltration. 
                  (a)  The contractor shall furnish an adequate number of plugs of the proper size and acceptable weirs to measure infiltration into the system. Measurements of flow shall be performed on any lines with a visible flow of water. 
                  (b)  In no case will an infiltration rate of greater than 100 GPD per inch diameter per mile of pipe be allowed. Also, any visible or audible leak must be dug up and repaired. Any increase in flow between two adjacent manholes must be corrected. 
                  2)  Exfiltration test (low air pressure test). 
                  (a)  After completing backfill of a gravity sewer line section, conduct a low pressure air test of all pipe constructed, using methods and devices acceptable to the department. Perform such test using the following general procedures: 
                  i.  Temporarily plug line segment between two manholes using plugs having air tight fittings through which low pressure air can be introduced into the pipe segment being tested. 
                  ii.  Introduce low pressure air into the test pipe segment until the internal air pressure reaches 4.5 psig above ground water pressure, if any. 
                  iii.  Wait at least two minutes for air temperature in the test segment to stabilize while internal air pressure remains no less than 3.5 psig above ground water pressure. 
                  iv.  Bleed internal air pressure to exactly 3.5 psig above ground water pressure. 
                  v.  Accurately determine the elapsed time for internal pressure to drop to 2.5 psig above ground water pressure. 
                  vi.  The air test is acceptable if elapsed time is no less than shown by the following table: 

                   
                  (b)  Air leakage time is based on pipe being damp. If pipe and joints are dry, dampen line if helpful in meeting air test time requirement. 
                  (c)  Permanently correct excessive leakage determined by air testing, and repeat operations until the inspector witnesses a successful test on each line segment. 
                  Note: Upon request, the department may allow substitution of a water exfiltration test in lieu of the low air pressure test. If used, the exfiltration test will be conducted with a minimum water head of two feet above the groundwater table and the allowable exfiltration will be limited to 100 GPD per inch diameter per mile of pipe. 
                  3)  Deflection test. 
                  (a)  Every section of sewer line shall be visibly checked for deflection. A passing section shall show a full circle when observed from one end. This may be done using mirrors to reflect sun light or by using lamps. Any section that fails this visual test shall be further checked as follows: 
                  The section shall have water run through it sufficient to fill any sags that may exist. Then it shall have a television camera pulled through it to check for sags. Any sag holding more than one inch of water will require that the pipe be removed and replaced to proper grade after which the section shall be televised again to verify correction. 
                  4)  Mandrel test for flexible pipe (PVC). 
                  (a)  All PVC gravity sewer mains shall be subjected to the Mandrel Test. The procedure for testing flexible pipe for maximum allowable deflection shall be generally as follows. See ASTM specifications for mandrel dimensions and more details. 
                  (b)  Completely flush the line making sure the pipe is clean of any mud or trash that would hinder the passage of the mandrel. 
                  (c)  During the final flushing of the line, attach a floating block or ball to the end of the mandrel pull rope and float the rope through the line. (A nylon ski rope is recommended) 
                  (d)  After the rope is threaded through the line, connect the pull rope to the mandrel and place the mandrel in the entrance of the pipe. 
                  (e)  Connect a second rope to the back of the mandrel. This will enable the mandrel to be retrieved if excessive deflection is encountered. 
                  (f)  Draw the mandrel through the sanitary sewer line. 
                  (g)  An increasing resistance to pull is an indication of excessive deflection. If this occurs mark the rope to note the location. Televise the sanitary sewer section to identify the extent of the problem and develop a plan, subject to department approval, for correcting the problem. 
                  (h)  Retest after correcting the problem. 
                  5)  T.V. inspection. In the event that the inspector cannot see through the line properly or conditions cause him to suspect that the line may be settled or broken or that the joints may not be made properly, he may direct that a T.V. camera be passed though the line. A video tape of the inspection will be made. Any discrepancies noted such as sagged pipes, broken pipes, bad joints, etc., will be dug up and will be corrected. Internal grouting to repair new lines will not be allowed. After connection of the discrepancies, the line will be reinspected. 
                  6)  Compaction testing. 
                  (a)  Compaction testing will be required for sanitary sewers constructed in paved areas or where pavement is planned. A minimum of five tests per 1,000 feet of sanitary sewer shall be conducted at varying depths. 
                  (b)  The department may require additional compaction tests be conducted if any other areas where the department's inspectors suspect the backfill has not been compacted in accordance with these regulations. If any of these tests show failing results, then the failing backfill will be removed, re-compacted and re-tested, and one additional area will be tested as well. 
                  7.5.4 Timing of service connections. In no circumstance shall any homes, buildings or plumbing fixtures be connected to the sanitary sewers until the sewers have been inspected and approved by the department. 
                  7.6 - Pre-treatment requirements for industrial wastewater. 
                  Some industrial and other developments may be required to pre-treat sewage prior to discharge into the county's collection system. Requirements for pre-treatment will be determined on a case by case basis. 
                  7.7 - Other requirements. 
                  No part of these regulations is intended to relieve the developer of his responsibility to comply with the requirements of the Georgia Department of Transportation, the Georgia Environmental Protection Division or other appropriate agencies. 
                  7.8 - Decentralized sewer systems, private sewer treatment facilities and community septic systems.

                  ARTICLE 8 - SITE GRADING, STORMWATER DETENTION, CULVERTS AND PIPED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS REQUIREMENTS 

                  8.1 - Site grading. 
                  8.1.1 General requirements. 
                  1)  Grading shall be done in accordance with the lines and grades shown on the approved construction plans. 
                  2)  Embankments shall be placed in uniform layers not to exceed a compacted thickness of six inches per layer and shall be compacted to a density of 95 percent of the maximum laboratory dry weight per cubic foot as determined by AASHTO Method T-99 in all areas where structures, parking lots and drives, streets, and utilities are to be placed. All other embankments are to be compacted to at least 85 percent. 
                  3)  The maximum slopes for cut or fill shall be 2:1 (two feet of horizontal run for each foot of rise or fall). The depth of cut referred to herein shall be the maximum cut or fill occurring in any one section of cut or fill. The slope of cut or fill shall be uniform throughout for each section of cut or fill except when the development control committee approves benching. When a cut is made in rock that requires blasting, the slope may be steeper if pre-splitting is employed and upon submission of a geotechnical report which substantiates the integrity of the rock in the steeper condition, subject to the review and approval of the development control committee. 
                  4)  While most soils in the area can be safely stabilized at a 2:1 slope, some soils exhibit a low shearing resistance and a low cohesiveness. These soils typically are micaceous silts and sandy soils with little or no clay. If the 2:1 slope shows evidence of shearing, noncohesiveness, sliding, or inability to maintain compaction, the slope shall be stabilized at 3:1 or by using such mechanical methods as needed (such as retaining walls or "grow mats" stapled in place) to maintain slope, height and integrity. 
                  8.2 - Stormwater detention. 
                  8.2.1 Stormwater management report required. 
                  1)  Every project shall provide a stormwater management report prepared by a professional engineer currently registered in the State of Georgia. The purpose of this report shall be to formulate a plan to manage stormwater runoff so that stormwater runoff hazards are not created and existing runoff-related problems are not exacerbated, either upstream or downstream from or within the boundaries of the property being developed. 
                  2)  The stormwater management report shall include a written narrative and shall identify the locations and quantities of stormwater runoff entering and exiting the site for both pre- and post-developed conditions. Analysis of the off-site properties shall anticipate future development in addition to addressing existing conditions. It shall contain drainage area delineation maps and other exhibits at satisfactory scale and sufficient in quantity and scope to define the boundaries of the site relative to watercourses, drainage divides, drainage structures, and other pertinent features. 
                  3)  The analysis of downstream conditions in the report shall address each and every point or area along the project site's boundaries at which runoff will exit the property. The analysis shall focus on the portion of the drainage way "immediately" downstream from, the project. This area shall generally extend a flow distance of about one-half mile from the project's boundary line, but shall be longer for projects contributing relatively large amounts of runoff to the study area, and shorter for small runoff contributions. In all cases, the most critical downstream area investigation shall be conducted relative to existing and anticipated land uses on tracts that adjoin the project site. 
                  8.2.2 Stormwater detention required. 
                  1)  If the stormwater management report indicates that adverse stormwater runoff is expected to result from the development of a property, that project shall be required to provide stormwater detention facilities. These detention facilities shall be designed so that their peak release rates, when combined with those of all detention bypass areas in the same basin, produce peak flow rates and flow velocities at the site's boundary line no greater than those which occurred at the same location for pre-developed conditions. 
                  2)  The following criteria shall be evaluated by the engineer preparing the stormwater management report, or the calculations and documents required may be performed and submitted by a registered land surveyor, licensed in the State of Georgia, and in determining whether or not detention should be required for any portion of any site: 
                  (a)  Existing land uses downstream. 
                  (b)  Anticipated future land uses downstream. 
                  (c)  Magnitude of increase in peak flows due to development. 
                  (d)  Presence of existing drainage problems. 
                  (e)  Capacity of existing and anticipated drainage systems. 
                  (f)  Creation of concentrated flows where none had occurred previously.

As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. 12-7-6 subsection (b). 
                  2)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land-disturbing activities occur. 
                  5)  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in 9.3.3.1)(o) and 9.3.3.1)(p) in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 (c).

                  (i)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. 12-7-1 et seq.; 
                  (j)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (k)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (l)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (m)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (n)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in section 9.3.2.2) of this article; 
                  (o)  Except as provided in paragraph (p) and (q) of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, or where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or where bulkheads and sea walls are installed to prevent shoreline erosion on Lake Oconee and Lake Sinclair; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  1.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  2.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (p)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  1.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  2.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines. 
                  (q)  There is established a 25-foot buffer along coastal marshlands, as measured horizontally from the coastal marshland-upland interface, as determined in accordance with Chapter 5 of Title 12 of this title, the "Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1970." and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where an alteration within the buffer area has been authorized pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-286, for maintenance of any currently serviceable structure, landscaping or hardscaping, including bridges, roads, parking lots, golf courses, golf cart paths, retaining walls, bulkheads, and patios; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project pans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, where a drainage structure or roadway drainage structure is constructed or maintained; provided; however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, on the landward side of any currently serviceable shoreline stabilization structure, or for the maintenance of any manmade storm-water detention basin, golf course pond, or impoundment that is located entirely within the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. For the purposes of this paragraph maintenance shall be defined as actions necessary or appropriate for retaining or restoring a currently serviceable improvement to the specified operable condition to achieve its maximum useful life. Maintenance includes emergency reconstruction of recently damaged parts of a currently serviceable structure so long as it occurs within a reasonable period of time after damage occurs. Maintenance does not include any modification that changes the character, scope and serviceable shall be defined as usable in its current state or with minor maintenance but no so degraded as to essentially require reconstruction. 
                  1.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat, and 
                  2.  The buffer shall not apply to crossings for utility lines that cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer, provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
                  3.  The buffer shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity conducted pursuant to and in compliance with a valid and effective land-disturbing permit issued subsequent to April 22, 2014, and prior to December 31, 2015; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project pans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented or any lot for which the preliminary plat has been approved prior to December 31, 2015 if roadways, bridges, or water and sewer lines have been extended to such lot prior to the effective date of this Act and if the requirement to maintain a 25-foot buffer would consume at least 18 percent of the high ground of the platted lot otherwise available for development provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
                  4.  Activities where the area within the buffer is not more than 500 square feet or that have a "Minor Buffer Impact" as defined in Rule 391-3-7-.01(r) of the Rules and Regulations of the State of Georgia, provided that the total area of buffer impacts is less than 5,000 square feet are deemed to have an approved buffer variance by rule. Bank stabilization structures are not eligible for coverage under the variance by rule and notification shall be made to the division at least 14 days prior to the commencement of land-disturbing activities. 
                  (r)  Operators are required to control waste, such as discarded building materials, concrete truck washout, chemicals, litter and sanitary waste; that may cause adverse impacts to water quality at the construction site pursuant to 40 CFR Part 122.34(4)(ii)(C). 
                  9.3.4 Additional requirements. Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in section 9.3.2 and 9.3.3. of this article. Paulding County stream buffer requirements are included in Article 12. 
                  9.3.5 Other. The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
                  (Res. No. 18-50, § 1 (Exh. A), 10-9-2018) 
                  9.4 - Application and permit process. 
                  9.4.1 General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
                  9.4.2 Application requirements. 
                  1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of Paulding County without first obtaining a permit from the community development department to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
                  2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the community development department and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in section 9.3.3 of this article. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land-disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of section 9.3.2 and 9.3.3 of this article will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by three copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
                  3)  Local permitting fees are included in article 14. 
                  4)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to paragraph (5) subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. 12-5-23, provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. 12-7-8 half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to paragraph (9) or (10) of O.C.G.A. 12-7-17 shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  5)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of a district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by section 9.3.3.1)(o), 9.3.3.1)(p) and 9.3.3.1)(q) has been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per section 9.4.2.7) have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
                  6)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this ordinance section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
                  7)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  9.4.3 Plan requirements. 
                  1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in section 9.3.2 and 9.3.3 of this article, or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this article. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and stormwater management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land-disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the Stakeholder Advisory Board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
                  2)  Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
                  9.4.4 Permits. 
                  1)  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
                  2)  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this article, any variances required by section 9.3.3.1)(o), 9.3.3.1)(p) and 9.3.3.1)(q) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per section 9.4.2.7) are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
                  3)  Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this article, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
                  4)  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
                  5)  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this article. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
                  6)  The LIA may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. 12-7-7(f)(1). 
                  7)  No permit shall be issued unless the applicant provides a statement by the Paulding County Tax Commissioner certifying all ad valorem taxes levied against the property have been paid.

                  1)  The community development department will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article. 
                  2)  The local issuing authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within 12 months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975. 
                  3)  The community development department shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this article, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities. 
                  4)  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
                  5)  The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-8(a). The districts or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
                  6)  The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within 90 days after notification by the division, the division shall revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority.

The violator shall have five days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within five days, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a stop-work order requiring that land-disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided, however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land-disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order in lieu of a warning; 
                  2)  For a third and each subsequent violation, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order; and 
                  3)  All stop-work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. 
                  4)  When a violation in the form of taking action without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer, or significant amounts of sediment, as determined by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee, have been or are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained, a stop work order shall be issued by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee. All such stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop work orders shall apply to all land-disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls. 
                  9.6.3 Bond forfeiture. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities has failed to comply with the approved plan, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to have forfeited his performance bond, if required to post one under the provisions of section 9.4.2.7. The local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. 
                  9.6.4 Monetary penalties. 
                  1)  Any person who violates any provisions of this article, or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant to this article, or who negligently or intentionally fails or refuses to comply with any final or emergency order of the director issued as provided in this article shall be liable for a civil penalty of at least $500.00 but not to exceed $2,500.00 per day.

                  ARTICLE 10 - FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT/FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION ORDINANCE[3] 
                  Introduction 
                  It is hereby determined that: 
                  The flood hazard areas of Paulding County, Georgia are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  Flood hazard areas can serve important stormwater management, water quality, streambank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation and ecological purposes when permanently protected as undisturbed or minimally disturbed areas. 
                  Effective floodplain management and flood hazard protection activities can: (1) protect human life and health; (2) minimize damage to private property; (3) minimize damage to public facilities and infrastructure such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; and (4) minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public. 
                  Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and section 36-1-20(a) of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, Paulding County, Georgia, does ordain this ordinance and establishes this set of floodplain management and flood hazard reduction provisions for the purpose of regulating the use of flood hazard areas. It is determined that the regulation of flood hazard areas and the prevention of flood damage are in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety, as well as to private and public property.

                  10.1.1 Purpose and intent . The purpose of this ordinance is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in flood hazard areas, as well as to protect the beneficial uses of floodplain areas for water quality protection, streambank and stream corridor protection, wetlands preservation and ecological and environmental protection by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to flooding or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
                  (4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; 
                  (5)  Limit the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; and, 
                  (6)  Protect the stormwater management, water quality, streambank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation and ecological functions of natural floodplain areas. 
                  10.1.2 Applicability . This ordinance shall be applicable to all areas of special flood hazard within Paulding County, Georgia. 
                  10.1.3 Designation of ordinance administrator. The Paulding County Community Development Director, together with assistance from the Paulding County Public Works professional engineering staff is hereby appointed to administer and implement the provisions of this ordinance. 
                  10.1.4 Basis for establishing areas of special flood hazard, areas of future-conditions flood hazard and associated floodplain characteristics—Flood area maps and studies. For the purposes of defining and determining "Areas of Special Flood Hazard," "Areas of Future-conditions Flood Hazard," "Areas of Shallow Flooding," "Base Flood Elevations," "Floodplains," "Floodways," "Future-conditions Flood Elevations," "Future-conditions Floodplains," potential flood hazard or risk categories as shown on FIRM maps, and other terms used in this ordinance, the following documents and sources may be used for such purposes and are adopted by reference thereto:

                  Site means the parcel of land being developed, or the portion thereof on which the development project is located. 
                  Start of construction includes substantial improvement, and means the date the permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of the structure on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building (including a gas or liquid storage tank), that is principally above ground, or a manufactured home. 
                  Subdivision means the division of a tract or parcel of land resulting in one or more new lots or building sites for the purpose, whether immediately or in the future, of sale, other transfer of ownership or land development, and includes divisions of land resulting from or made in connection with the layout or development of a new street or roadway or a change in an existing street or roadway. 
                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. This term also includes repetitive loss. 
                  Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement to a structure, taking place during a ten-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the improvement. The market value of the building means (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions, which have been identified by the code enforcement official. The term does also not include any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home park or subdivision is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this ordinance. 
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the requirements of this ordinance. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this ordinance is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  10.4.1 Definition of floodplain boundaries. 
                  (1)  Studied "A" zones, as identified in the FIS, shall be used to establish base flood elevations whenever available. 
                  (2)  For all streams with a drainage area of 100 acres or greater, the future-conditions flood elevations shall be provided by the Paulding County Community Development Director. If future-conditions elevation data is not available from the Paulding County Community Development Director, then it shall be determined by a licensed professional engineer using a method approved by FEMA and the Paulding County Community Development Director and/or the Paulding County Public Works professional engineering staff. 
                  10.4.2 Definition of floodway boundaries. 
                  (1)  The width of a floodway shall be determined from the FIS or FEMA approved flood study. For all streams with a drainage area of 100 acres or greater, the regulatory floodway shall be provided by the Paulding County Community Development Director. If floodway data is not available from the Paulding County Community Development Director, then it shall be determined by a licensed professional engineer using a method approved by FEMA and the Paulding County Community Development Director and/or the Paulding County Public Works professional engineering staff. 
                  10.4.3 General standards. 
                  (1)  No development shall be allowed within any area of special flood hazard or area of future-conditions flood hazard that could result in any of the following: 
                  (a)  Raising the base flood elevation or future-conditions flood elevation equal to or more than 0.01 foot; 
                  (b)  Reducing the base flood or future-conditions flood storage capacity; 
                  (c)  Changing the flow characteristics as to the depth and velocity of the waters of the base flood or future-conditions flood as they pass both the upstream and the downstream boundaries of the development area; or, 
                  (d)  Creating hazardous or erosion-producing velocities, or resulting in excessive sedimentation. 
                  (2)  Any development within any area of special flood hazard or area of future-conditions flood hazard allowed under section 4.3(1) shall also meet the following conditions: 
                  (a)  Compensation for storage capacity shall occur between the average ground water table elevation and the base flood elevation for the base flood, and between the average ground water table elevation and the future-condition flood elevation for the future-conditions flood, and lie either within the boundaries of ownership of the property being developed and shall be within the immediate vicinity of the location of the encroachment. Acceptable means of providing required compensation include lowering of natural ground elevations within the floodplain, or lowering of adjoining land areas to create additional floodplain storage. In no case shall any required compensation be provided via bottom storage or by excavating below the elevation of the natural (pre-development) stream channel unless such excavation results from the widening or relocation of the stream channel; 
                  (b)  Cut areas shall be stabilized and graded to a slope of no less than 2.0 percent; 
                  (c)  Effective transitions shall be provided such that flow velocities occurring on both upstream and downstream properties are not increased or decreased; 
                  (d)  Verification of no-rise conditions (less than 0.01 foot), flood storage volumes, and flow characteristics shall be provided via a step-backwater analysis meeting the requirements of section 10.4.4; 
                  (e)  Public utilities and facilities, such as water, sanitary sewer, gas, and electrical systems, shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate infiltration or contamination from flood waters; and 
                  (f)  Any significant physical changes to the base flood floodplain shall be submitted as a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) or conditional letter of map amendment (CLOMA), whichever is applicable. The CLOMR submittal shall be subject to approval by the Paulding County Community Development Director using the FEMA community concurrence forms before forwarding the submittal package to FEMA for final approval. The responsibility for forwarding the CLOMR to FEMA and for obtaining the CLOMR approval shall be the responsibility of the applicant.

                  10.4.4 Engineering study requirements for floodplain encroachments. An engineering study is required, as appropriate to the proposed development activities on the site, whenever a development proposes to disturb any land within the future-conditions floodplain, except for a residential single-lot development on streams without established base flood elevations and floodways. This study shall be prepared by a licensed professional engineer and made a part of the application for a permit. This information shall be submitted to and approved by the Paulding County Community Development Director prior to the approval of any permit which would authorize the disturbance of land located within the future-conditions floodplain. Such study shall include: 
                  (1)  Description of the extent to which any watercourse or floodplain will be altered or relocated as a result of the proposed development; 
                  (2)  Step-backwater analysis, using a FEMA-approved methodology approved by the Paulding County Community Development Director. Cross-sections (which may be supplemented by the applicant) and flow information will be obtained whenever available. Computations will be shown duplicating FIS results and will then be rerun with the proposed modifications to determine the new base flood profiles, and future-conditions flood profiles; 
                  (3)  Floodplain storage calculations based on cross-sections (at least one every 100 feet) showing existing and proposed floodplain conditions to show that base flood floodplain and future-conditions floodplain storage capacity would not be diminished by the development; 
                  (4)  The study shall include a preliminary plat, grading plan, or site plan, as appropriate, which shall clearly define all future-conditions floodplain encroachments. 
                  10.4.5 Floodway encroachments. Located within areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity flood waters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, floodways must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore the following provisions shall apply: 
                  (1)  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway, except for activities specifically allowed in (2) below. 
                  (2)  Encroachments for bridges, culverts, roadways and utilities within the regulatory floodway may be permitted provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment will not result in any increase to the pre-project base flood elevations, floodway elevations, or floodway widths during the base flood discharge. A licensed professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof; and 
                  (3)  If the applicant proposes to revise the floodway boundaries, no permit authorizing the encroachment into or an alteration of the floodway shall be issued by the Paulding County Community Development Director until an affirmative conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) is issued by FEMA and no-rise certification is approved by the Paulding County Community Development Director. 
                  10.4.6 Maintenance requirements. The property owner shall be responsible for continuing maintenance as may be needed within an altered or relocated portion of a floodplain on his property so that the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity is not diminished. The Paulding County Community Development Director may direct the property owner (at no cost to Paulding County) to restore the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity of the floodplain if the owner has not performed maintenance as required by the approved floodplain management plan on file with the Paulding County Community Development Director.

                  (5)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of Historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure, and the variance issued shall be the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (6)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this section are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (7)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (8)  In reviewing such requests, the Paulding County Development Waiver Review Committee and Paulding County Board of Commissioners shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this ordinance. 
                  (9)  Conditions for variances: 
                  (a)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  (i)  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
                  (ii)  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and, 
                  (iii)  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, or the creation of a nuisance. 
                  (b)  The provisions of this ordinance are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore, any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
                  (c)  Any person to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance resulting from the lowest floor elevation being placed below the base flood elevation will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property, and that such costs may be as high as $25.00 for each $100.00 of insurance coverage provided. 
                  (d)  The Paulding County Community Development Director shall maintain the records of all variance actions, both granted and denied, and report them to the Georgia Department of Natural Resources and the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.

                  ARTICLE 11 - REUSE WATER MAINS AND ACCESSORIES 

                  11.1 - General. 
                  11.1.1 Scope. 
                  1)  The contractor or developer shall furnish all equipment, labor, and materials (unless otherwise agreed upon in writing) necessary to construct reuse water mains and perform all work specified or indicated on the standard details. The work shall include all necessary concrete work, diking, pumping, bailing, draining, flushing, soil erosion and sedimentation control, and testing. These specifications cover reuse water mains and service connections complete. The reuse water mains shall be installed in the locations indicated on the standard details or as otherwise directed by the water and sewer system department (hereafter referred to in this article as "the department."). 
                  2)  The contractor shall arrange his work so as to minimize interference with pedestrian and vehicular traffic, and to avoid interruption of service of any existing utilities. The contractor shall furnish and maintain suitable bridges, footways, or other means of access to or across intercepted streets, alleys, driveways and walkways, where necessary. 
                  3)  Contractor shall perform all work in accordance with the latest revision of "Design Guidelines for Water Reclamation and Urban Water Reuse" of Georgia Department of Natural Resources, Environmental Protection Division. 
                  4)  The contractor shall be responsible for removing all water from excavations and trenches whether from surface or ground sources. 
                  5)  The contractor shall guarantee all material and workmanship for a period of 18 months from the date of final acceptance of the work. If during this period any material or workmanship, etc., proves defective, the contractor shall repair same at his own cost and expense and to the satisfaction of the department. 
                  6)  In addition to the responsibility of the contractor for remedying observed defects in his work during the guarantee period, the contractor shall also reimburse the department for all expenses incurred in investigations to assure the department that the completed work is in accordance with these specifications. 
                  11.1.2 Reuse water system flow demand. 
                  1)  The developer shall provide hydraulic analysis of the reuse water system performed by a professional engineer registered in the State of Georgia. 
                  2)  Design flow rates for each pipe shall be evaluated independently based on the number of residential units served as described in the following formula: 
                  Q D = (3.36 x N 0.785 ) + 50 
                  Where: Q D = Reuse Water Flow in gallons per minute 
                  N = Number of Equivalent Residential Units (ERU) 
                  1 ERU = 300 Gallons per day 
                  3)  Design flows shall be distributed equally at each residential unit. When flow rates are aggregated to nodes for analysis, flow shall be assigned to the most distant node from the source. 
                  4)  Minimum reuse water delivery pressure at any point in the system shall be 45 psi when the system is operating at design flow rates based on a flow test conducted and approved by Paulding County. 
                  5)  In any case, lines shall not be less than four inches in diameter: 
                  11.1.3 Reuse water system water balance. 
                  1)  The developer shall provide water balance calculations for the development performed by a professional engineer registered in the State of Georgia. 
                  2)  The water balance evaluation is critical to ensure the same volume of wastewater being discharged from a particular development can be returned for irrigation purposes (i.e. balanced). The water balance evaluates the projected average daily flow (ADF) from the proposed development and compares this to the computed total reuse return application rate (Q A ) considering each of the two application areas (residential lawns and irrigated open space): 
                  3)  Calculations must illustrate the development will have adequate spray area to accommodate 100 percent of the sewage generated from the development as described in the following formula: 
                  WB = (Q A /ADF) 
                  Where: WB = Water Balance Ratio 
                  Q A = Total Reuse Return Rate (gpd) 
                  ADF = Average Daily Flow (gpd) 
                  4)  A WB result of 1.0 or greater is required to meet the development's reuse demand. 
                  5)  The average daily flow (ADF) for the development will be based on 300 gallons per day for each equivalent residential unit (ERU). 
                  6)  The total reuse return rate for the development will be based on the residential and open space areas available to accept reuse water. Return rates for these two types of areas will be based on the formulas below. 
                  Q A = q r + q o 
                  Where: Q A = Total Reuse Return Rate (gpd) 
                  q r = Residential/Commercial Reuse Return Rate (gpd) 
                  q o = Open Space Reuse Return Rate (gpd) 
                  q r = 0.08(n x ai x i) 
                  Where: q r = Residential Reuse Return Rate (gpd) 
                  n = Number of Residential Lots 
                  a;sub \sub; = Irrigable Area per Lot (Square Feet) 
                  i = Reuse Application Rate (in/wk) 
                  q o = 3,336(Ai x i) 
                  Where: q o = Open Space Reuse Return Rate (gpd) 
                  A;sub \sub; = Irrigable Area per Lot (Acres) 
                  i = Reuse Application Rate (in/wk) 
                  7)  The reuse application rate (i) is generally accepted at 1.5 inches per week but can be adjusted at the discretion of the professional engineer based on the results of soil testing throughout the development. However, the reuse application rate will not exceed 1.8 inches per week. 
                  8)  Only commercial areas associated with PRD type zoned developments will be included in the calculations for reuse. 
                  11.1.4 Applicable specifications and standards. The latest editions of the following specifications, standards and publications setting the minimum requirements for quality, safety and performance of work and materials form a part of these regulations as though fully repeated herein: 

                   
                  11.1.5 Record standard details. 
                  1)  The contractor shall be responsible for maintaining a set of the approved design standard details, which have been marked to reflect as-built conditions. These "record standard details" shall be kept at the site during working hours and shall be made available to the department's inspectors upon request. 
                  2)  The record standard details shall show the as-built location of, but not be limited to, all lines, manholes, valves, hydrants, blow-off valves, monuments, etc.

                  11.2.2 Sheeting and shoring materials. 
                  1)  Construction wood sheeting may be new or used lumber of a species or grade suitable for the proposed use. 
                  2)  If steel sheet piling is used, it shall conform to ASTM A328 and consist of rolled sections of the continuous interlocking type. Minimum thickness of the web and flange metal shall be 3/8 -inch, unless otherwise approved or specified. Rivet steel and structural material as fabricated connections and accessories shall conform to requirements of ASTM A502 and ASTM A36. All steel sheet piles shall be furnished with standard pulling holes located approximately four inches below the top of the pile. 
                  3)  The contractor shall retain full responsibility for the structural integrity and adequacy of the sheeting. 
                  11.2.3 Sheeting and shoring activities. 
                  1)  All excavations shall be properly shored, sheeted and braced or cut back at the proper slope to furnish safe working conditions; to prevent shifting of material; to prevent damage to structures or other work; and to avoid delay to the work. Work shall be performed in all compliance with the most recent U.S. Department of Labor Occupational Safety and Health Administration 29CFR part 1926 Occupational Safety and Health Standards-Excavations, Final Rule. Bracing shall be so arranged as not to place any strain on portions of completed work until the general construction has proceeded far enough to provide ample strength. 
                  2)  Timber sheet piles shall be sharpened in a manner which will assist in holding them in true alignment during driving and the tops shall be protected with caps or other means to prevent damage by the driving equipment. Any pieces damaged or split below the point of cutoff shall be removed and replaced with undamaged pieces. 
                  3)  Sheet piles shall be carefully located and driven straight and true to the desired elevation with secure interlocking for the entire length. Damaged piling or one with faulty alignment shall be withdrawn and new piling driven properly in its place. Jetting will not be permitted. Excavation shall not be carried in advance of the sheet piling. 
                  4)  Sheeting and bracing shall be removed as the excavation is refilled in such a manner as to avoid caving in of areas or structures. Voids left by withdrawal of the sheeting shall be carefully filled by ramming. 
                  11.2.4 Excavation. 
                  1)  The contractor shall perform all excavation in accordance with the most recent OSHA standards and to the depths required or as shown on standard details. During excavation, materials suitable for backfilling shall be piled a minimum distance of two feet from the banks of the excavation to avoid overloading and to prevent slides and cave-ins. 
                  2)  Excavated materials not required for fill or back-fill shall be removed from the site. Unless otherwise indicated or specified, all excavation shall be made by open cut. No tunneling shall be done. 
                  3)  Excavation shall not be carried below the designated level except where special bedding required due to unforeseen conditions, or is specified or shown on the standard details. Excess excavation below the designated level shall be backfilled with crushed stone and tamped. 
                  4)  Excess excavation for manholes and other structures shall be filled with crushed stone or concrete to the required elevation. 
                  5)  Trenches shall be only of sufficient width to provide a free working space on each side of the pipe. To prevent excess pressure on the pipe, the maximum width of pipe trench at the top of the pipe shall not be greater than two feet more than the pipe diameter. If this maximum width is exceeded for water or sewer pipelines, the contractor shall provide Class A bedding as presented in article 7 of these regulations. The top portion of the trench above four feet shall be excavated with sloping sides in accordance with OSHA standards to any width which will not damage adjoining structures, roadways, pavements, utilities or private property. If it is deemed necessary to excavate trench with vertical sides, then OSHA approved shoring and sheeting methods shall be used. 
                  6)  All reuse water mains shall have a minimum of 48 inches of cover above the top of the pipe or 48 inches below edge of pavement, whichever is greater. All reuse water mains 12 inches and larger shall have a minimum of 60 inches of cover above the top of pipe or 60 inches below edge of pavement, whichever is greater unless otherwise indicated by the department. 
                  7)  The trench bottom shall be made to conform as near as possible to the shape of the lower third of the pipe. Excavation shall be made for joints of all pipes, and shall be of sufficient depth to permit access to the joint for construction and inspection. In no case shall the joints be used to support the body of the pipe. Bell holes shall be excavated in the trenches so as to relieve pipe bells of all load, but small enough to insure that support is provided throughout the length of the pipe barrel. 
                  8)  Unstable soil or soil unable to achieve 95 percent compaction as per Standard Proctor shall be removed and replaced with crushed stone, which shall be tamped. 
                  9)  Ground adjacent to all excavations shall be graded to prevent inflow of water.

                  1)  Where a parcel was platted prior to the effective date of this ordinance, and its shape, topography or other existing physical condition prevents land development consistent with this ordinance, and the Paulding County Water and Sewer System Department and Paulding County Community Development Department finds and determines that the requirements of this ordinance prohibit the otherwise lawful use of the property by the owner, the request for a variance may be forwarded to the Paulding County Development Waiver Review Committee for a hearing. 
                  The Paulding County Development Waiver Review Committee shall hold a hearing on the variance request within 30 days of the date of the variance request or at its next regularly scheduled meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in the administration article of the development regulations. In the event the Paulding County Development Waiver Review Committee determines that the criteria contained herein are met, the Paulding County Development Waiver Review Committee may grant a variance from the buffer and setback requirements hereunder, provided such variance require mitigation measures to offset the effects of any proposed land development on the parcel. In the event the party requesting the variance is aggrieved by the decision of the Paulding County Development Waiver Review Committee, the variance request may be appealed to the Paulding County Board of Commissioners for consideration. All such appeals of variance requests must be made in writing with a copy provided to the Paulding County Board of Commissioners and the Paulding County Community Development Department and must be submitted within 30 days of the decision by the Paulding County Development Waiver Review Committee. Thereafter, the Paulding County Board of Commissioners shall consider the appeal at a public meeting within 30 days or at its next regularly scheduled meeting. The Paulding County Board of Commissioners may grant a variance from the buffer and setback requirements hereunder, provided such variance require mitigation measures to offset the effects of any proposed land development on the parcel. 
                  2)  Except as provided above, the Paulding County Development Waiver Review Committee and/or the board of commissioners shall grant no variance from any provision of this ordinance without first conducting a public hearing on the application for variance and authorizing the granting of the variance by an affirmative vote of the Paulding County Board of Commissioners. Paulding County shall give public notice of each such public hearing in a newspaper of general circulation within Paulding County. Paulding County shall require that the applicant post a sign giving notice of the proposed variance and the public hearing. The sign shall be of a size and posted in such a location on the property as to be clearly visible from the primary adjacent road right-of-way. 
                  Variances will be considered only in the following cases: 
                  (a)  When a property's shape, topography or other physical conditions existing at the time of the adoption of this ordinance prevents land development unless a buffer variance is granted. 
                  (b)  Unusual circumstances when strict adherence to the minimal buffer requirements in the ordinance would create an extreme hardship. 
                  Variances will not be considered when, following adoption of this ordinance, actions of any property owner of a given property have created conditions of a hardship on that property. 
                  3)  At a minimum, a variance request shall include the following information: 
                  (a)  A site map that includes locations of all streams, wetlands, floodplain boundaries and other natural features, as determined by field survey; 
                  (b)  A description of the shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property; 
                  (c)  A detailed site plan that shows the locations of all existing and proposed structures and other impervious cover, the limits of all existing and proposed land disturbance, both inside and outside the buffer and setback. The exact area of the buffer to be affected shall be accurately and clearly indicated; 
                  (d)  Documentation of unusual hardship should the buffer be maintained; 
                  (e)  At least one alternative plan, which does not include a buffer or setback intrusion, or an explanation of why such a site plan is not possible; 
                  (f)  A calculation of the total area and length of the proposed intrusion; 
                  (g)  A stormwater management site plan, if applicable; and, 
                  (h)  Proposed mitigation, if any, for the intrusion. If no mitigation is proposed, the request must include an explanation of why none is being proposed. 
                  4)  The following factors will be considered in determining whether to issue a variance: 
                  (a)  The shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property; 
                  (b)  The locations of all streams on the property, including along property boundaries; 
                  (c)  The location and extent of the proposed buffer or setback intrusion; and, 
                  (d)  Whether alternative designs are possible which require less intrusion or no intrusion; 
                  (e)  The long-term and construction water-quality impacts of the proposed variance; 
                  (f)  Whether issuance of the variance is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment. 
                  12.6 - Compatibility with other buffer regulations and requirements. 
                  This ordinance is not intended to interfere with, abrogate or annul any other ordinance, rule or regulation, statute or other provision of law. Provided however, in the event that stream bank buffer requirements exist in other county ordinances, including the Paulding County Zoning Ordinance and other Articles of the Paulding County Development Regulations, that are less restrictive than the measurements and standards contained herein, the terms of this article shall control. 
                  The requirements of this ordinance should be considered minimum requirements, and where any provision of this ordinance imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall be considered to take precedence. 
                  12.7 - Additional information requirements for development on buffer zone properties. 
                  Any permit applications for property requiring buffers and setbacks hereunder must include the following:

                  3)  Any other documentation that the (review and permitting authority) may reasonably deem necessary for review of the application and to insure that the buffer zone ordinance is addressed in the approval process. 
                  All buffer and setback areas must be recorded on the final plat of the property following plan approval. 
                  12.8 - Responsibility. 
                  Neither the issuance of a development permit nor compliance with the conditions thereof, nor with the provisions of this ordinance shall relieve any person from any responsibility otherwise imposed by law for damage to persons or property; nor shall the issuance of any permit hereunder serve to impose any liability upon Paulding County, its officers or employees, for injury or damage to persons or property. 
                  12.9 - Inspection. 
                  Paulding County may cause inspections of the work in the buffer or setback to be made periodically during the course thereof and shall make a final inspection following completion of the work.

                  It is hereby determined that: 
                  Land development projects and other land use conversions, and their associated changes to land cover, permanently alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, which in turn increase flooding, stream channel erosion, and sediment transport and deposition; 
                  Land development projects and other land use conversions also contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters; 
                  The impacts of post-development stormwater runoff quantity and quality can adversely affect public safety, public and private property, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters; 
                  These adverse impacts can be controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff quantity and quality from new development and redevelopment, by the use of both structural facilities as well as nonstructural measures, such as the conservation of open space and greenspace areas. The preservation and protection of natural area and greenspace for stormwater management benefits is encouraged through the use of incentives or "credits." The Georgia Greenspace Program provides a mechanism for the preservation and coordination of those greenspace areas which provide stormwater management quality and quantity benefits; 
                  Localities in the State of Georgia are required to comply with a number of both state and federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of post-development stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution; 
                  Therefore, Paulding County has established this set of stormwater management policies to provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of post-development stormwater runoff for the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation. It has determined that it is in the public interest to regulate post-development stormwater runoff discharges in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes, post-construction soil erosion and sedimentation, stream channel erosion, and nonpoint source pollution associated with post-development stormwater runoff. 
                  13.2 - General provisions. 
                  13.2.1 Purpose and intent. The purpose of this ordinance is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-development stormwater runoff and nonpoint source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment. It has been determined that proper management of post-development stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety, environment and general welfare of the public, and protect water and aquatic resources. This ordinance seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives: 
                  1)  Establish decision-making processes surrounding land development activities that protect the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources; 
                  2)  Require that new development and redevelopment maintain the pre-development hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as practicable in order to reduce flooding, streambank erosion, nonpoint source pollution and increases in stream temperature, and maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats; 
                  3)  Establish minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality; 
                  4)  Establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater control facilities that can be used to meet the minimum post-development stormwater management standards; 
                  5)  Encourage the use of nonstructural stormwater management and stormwater better site design practices, such as the preservation of greenspace and other conservation areas, to the maximum extent practicable. Coordinate site design plans, which include greenspace, with the county's greenspace protection plan; 
                  6)  Establish provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of structural stormwater control facilities and nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained, and pose no threat to public safety; and, 
                  7)  Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans, and for the inspection of approved active projects, and long-term follow up. 
                  13.2.2 Applicability. 
                  1)  This ordinance shall be applicable to all land development, including, but not limited to, site plan applications, subdivision applications, and grading applications, unless exempt pursuant to subsection 2) below. These standards apply to any new development or redevelopment site that meets one or more of the following criteria: 
                  (a)  New development that involves the creation of 5,000 square feet or more of impervious cover, or that involves other land development activities of one acre or more; 
                  (b)  Redevelopment that includes the creation, addition or replacement of 5,000 square feet or more of impervious cover, or that involves other land development activity of one acre or more; 
                  (c)  Any new development or redevelopment, regardless of size, that is defined by the Paulding County Community Development Director to be a hotspot land use; or, 
                  (d)  Land development activities that are smaller than the minimum applicability criteria set forth in items (a) and (b) above if such activities are part of a larger common plan of development, even though multiple, separate and distinct land development activities may take place at different times on different schedules.

Prior to the issuance of any permit for a land development activity requiring a stormwater management facility or practice hereunder and for which the Paulding County requires ongoing maintenance, the applicant or owner of the site must, unless an on-site stormwater management facility or practice is dedicated to and accepted by the Paulding County, execute an inspection and maintenance agreement, and/or a conservation easement, if applicable, that shall be binding on all subsequent owners of the site. 
                  Unless otherwise agreed to by the county, all stormwater facilities and practices will require maintenance agreements and will be inspected by the county. The inspection and maintenance agreement, if applicable, must be approved by the Paulding County prior to plan approval, and recorded in the deed records upon final plat approval. 
                  The inspection and maintenance agreement shall identify by name or official title the person(s) responsible for carrying out the inspection and maintenance. Responsibility for the operation and maintenance of the stormwater management facility or practice, unless assumed by a governmental agency, shall remain with the property owner and shall pass to any successor owner. If portions of the land are sold or otherwise transferred, legally binding arrangements shall be made to pass the inspection and maintenance responsibility to the appropriate successors in title. These arrangements shall designate for each portion of the site, the person to be permanently responsible for its inspection and maintenance. 
                  As part of the inspection and maintenance agreement, a schedule shall be developed for when and how often routine inspection and maintenance will occur to ensure proper function of the stormwater management facility or practice. The agreement shall also include plans for annual inspections to ensure proper performance of the facility between scheduled maintenance and shall also include remedies for the default thereof. 
                  In addition to enforcing the terms of the inspection and maintenance agreement, Paulding County may also enforce all of the provisions for ongoing inspection and maintenance in section 13.6 of this ordinance. 
                  Paulding County, in lieu of an inspection and maintenance agreement, may accept dedication of any existing or future stormwater management facility for maintenance, provided such facility meets all the requirements of this ordinance and includes adequate and perpetual access and sufficient area, by easement or otherwise, for inspection and regular maintenance. 
                  13.4.5 Performance and maintenance bonds. The Paulding County Community Development Department requires the posting of maintenance/performance bonds or other security to guarantee performance of construction and/or maintenance obligations hereunder. All storm drainage facilities used for water quality and quantity best management practices shall be maintained in accordance with the standards aforesaid for a period of 18 months from the date this bond is signed and this bond will not be released until such time that we are notified in writing by Paulding County Water and Sewer System Department and the Paulding County Community Development Department that the work has been done properly and satisfactorily completed.

                  13.4.8 Modifications for off-site facilities. The stormwater management plan for each land development project shall provide for stormwater management measures located on the site of the project, unless provisions are made to manage stormwater by an off-site or regional facility. The off-site or regional facility must be located on property legally dedicated for the purpose, must be designed and adequately sized to provide a level of stormwater quantity and quality control that is equal to or greater than that which would be afforded by on-site practices and there must be a legally-obligated entity responsible for long-term operation and maintenance of the off-site or regional stormwater facility. In addition, on-site measures shall be implemented, where necessary, to protect upstream and downstream properties and drainage channels from the site to the off-site facility. 
                  A stormwater management plan must be submitted to the Paulding County Community Development Department which shows the adequacy of the off-site or regional facility. 
                  To be eligible for a modification, the applicant must demonstrate to the satisfaction of Paulding County that the use of an off-site or regional facility will not result in the following impacts to upstream or downstream areas: 
                  1)  Increased threat of flood damage to public health, life, and property; 
                  2)  Deterioration of existing culverts, bridges, dams, and other structures; 
                  3)  Accelerated streambank or streambed erosion or siltation; 
                  4)  Degradation of in-stream biological functions or habitat; or 
                  5)  Water quality impairment in violation of state water quality standards, and/or violation of any state or federal regulations. 
                  13.5 - Post-development stormwater management performance criteria. 
                  The following performance criteria shall be applicable to all stormwater management plans, unless otherwise provided for in this ordinance: 
                  13.5.1 Water quality. All stormwater runoff generated from a site shall be adequately treated before discharge. It will be presumed that a stormwater management system complies with this requirement if: 
                  1)  It is sized to treat the prescribed water quality treatment volume from the site, as defined in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual; 
                  2)  Appropriate structural stormwater controls or nonstructural practices are selected, designed, constructed or preserved, and maintained according to the specific criteria in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual; and, 
                  3)  Runoff from hotspot land uses and activities identified by the Paulding County Stormwater Division are adequately treated and addressed through the use of appropriate structural stormwater controls, nonstructural practices and pollution prevention practices. 
                  13.5.2 Stream channel protection. Protection of stream channels from bank and bed erosion and degradation shall be provided by using all of the following three approaches: 
                  1)  Preservation, restoration and/or reforestation (with native vegetation) of the applicable stream buffer; 
                  2)  24-hour extended detention storage of the one-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event; 
                  3)  Erosion prevention measures such as energy dissipation and velocity control. 
                  13.5.3 Overbank flooding protection. Downstream overbank flood and property protection shall be provided by controlling (attenuating) the post-development peak discharge rate to the pre-development rate for the 25-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event. If control of the one-year, 24-hour storm under section 13.5.2 is exempted, then peak discharge rate attenuation of the 2-year through the 25-year return frequency storm event must be provided. 
                  13.5.4 Extreme flooding protection. Extreme flood and public safety protection shall be provided by controlling and safely conveying the 100-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event such that flooding is not exacerbated. 
                  13.5.5 Structural stormwater controls. All structural stormwater management facilities shall be selected and designed using the appropriate criteria from the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. All structural stormwater controls must be designed appropriately to meet their intended function. For other structural stormwater controls not included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual, or for which pollutant removal rates have not been provided, the effectiveness and pollutant removal of the structural control must be documented through prior studies, literature reviews, or other means and receive approval from Paulding County Community Development Department before being included in the design of a stormwater management system. In addition, if hydrologic or topographic conditions, or land use activities warrant greater control than that provided by the minimum control requirements, the Paulding County Community Development Department may impose additional requirements deemed necessary to protect upstream and downstream properties and aquatic resources from damage due to increased volume, frequency, and rate of stormwater runoff or increased nonpoint source pollution loads created on the site in question. 
                  Applicants shall consult the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual for guidance on the factors that determine site design feasibility when selecting and locating a structural stormwater control. 
                  13.5.6 Stormwater credits for nonstructural measures. The use of one or more site design measures by the applicant may allow for a reduction in the water quality treatment volume required under section 13.5.1. The applicant may, if approved by the Paulding County Community Development Department, take credit for the use of stormwater better site design practices and reduce the water quality volume requirement. For each potential credit, there is a minimum set of criteria and requirements which identify the conditions or circumstances under which the credit may be applied. The site design practices that qualify for this credit and the criteria and procedures for applying and calculating the credits are included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. 
                  13.5.7 Drainage system guidelines. Stormwater conveyance facilities, which may include but are not limited to culverts, stormwater drainage pipes, catch basins, drop inlets, junction boxes, headwalls, gutter, swales, channels, ditches, and energy dissipaters shall be provided when necessary for the protection of public right-of-way and private properties adjoining project sites and/or public rights-of-way.

                  ARTICLE I. - [PURPOSES] 

                  Sec. A. - Purposes. 
                  This ordinance is designed and intended to balance the interests of the residents of Paulding County, telecommunications providers, and telecommunications customers in the siting of telecommunications facilities within unincorporated Paulding County so as to protect the health, safety, and integrity of residential neighborhoods, and to foster, through appropriate zoning and land use controls, a competitive environment for telecommunications carriers that does not unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent personal wireless services. This ordinance shall not prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services. This ordinance is intended to promote Paulding County as a proactive county in the availability of personal wireless telecommunications service. To that end, this ordinance shall: 
                  (1)  Provide for the appropriate location and development of telecommunications facilities within unincorporated Paulding County; 
                  (2)  Protect Paulding County's built and natural environment by promoting compatible design standards for telecommunications facilities; 
                  (3)  Minimize adverse visual impacts of telecommunications facilities through careful design, siting, landscape screening and innovative camouflaging techniques; 
                  (4)  Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower or antenna failure through engineering and careful siting of telecommunications tower structures and antennas; 
                  (5)  Maximum use of any new and existing telecommunications towers through collocation so as to minimize the need to construct new towers and minimize the total number of towers throughout the county; 
                  (6)  Maximum and encourage use of alternate telecommunication tower structures as a primary option rather than construction of additional single-use towers; and 
                  (7)  Encourage and promote the location of new telecommunications activities in areas which are not zoned for residential use. 
                  ARTICLE II. - [DEFINITIONS]

                  (8)  Tower: any structure that is designed and constructed primarily for the purpose of supporting one or more antennas, including self-supporting lattice towers, guy towers, or monopole towers. The term includes radio and television transmission towers, microwave towers, common-carrier towers, cellular telephone towers, alternative tower structures, and the like. 
                  ARTICLE III. - APPLICABILITY; STANDARDS; APPLICATION PROCEDURE 

                  Sec. A. - Applicability. 
                  (1)  District height limitations. The requirements set forth in this ordinance shall govern the location of towers that exceed, and antennas that are installed at a height in excess of, the height limitations specified for each zoning district. The height limitations applicable to buildings and structures shall not apply to towers and antennas. 
                  (2)  Public property. Antennas or towers located on property owned, leased, or otherwise controlled by the governing authority shall be exempt from the requirements of this ordinance, provided a license or lease authorizing such antenna or tower has been approved by the governing authority. 
                  (3)  Amateur radio, receive-only antennas. This ordinance shall not govern any tower, or the installation of any antenna, that is under 70 feet in height and is owned and operated by a federally licensed amateur radio station operator or is used exclusively for receive-only antennas. 
                  (4)  Preexisting towers and antennas. Any tower or antenna for which a permit has been properly issued prior to the effective date of this ordinance shall not be required to meet the requirements of this ordinance, other than the requirements of article III, section B(4) and (5). Any such towers or antennas shall be referred to in this ordinance as "preexisting towers" or "preexisting antennas." 
                  Sec. B. - Standards applicable to all towers and antennas. 
                  No tower or antenna shall be located in Paulding County except as set forth in this ordinance. The following standards shall apply to all towers and antennas, unless the governing authority reduces the standards if the goals of this ordinance would be better served thereby: 
                  (1)  Principal or accessory use. Antennas and towers may be considered either principal or accessory uses. A difference [different] existing use or an existing structure on the same lot shall not preclude the installation of an antenna or tower on such lot. For purposes of determining whether the installation of a tower or antenna complies with district development regulations, including but not limited to setback requirements, lot coverage requirements, and other such requirements, the dimensions of the entire lot shall control, even though the antennas or towers may be located on leased parcels within such lots. Towers that are constructed and antennas that are installed in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance shall not be deemed to constitute the expansion of a nonconforming use or structure. 
                  (2)  Inventory of existing sites. Each applicant for an antenna and/or tower shall provide to the community development department an inventory of its existing towers that are either within the geographic area of Paulding County or within one-half mile of the border thereof, including specific information about the location, height, and design of each tower (pursuant to section C of this article). The community development department may share such information with other applicants applying for administrative approvals or special use permits under this ordinance or other organizations seeking to locate antennas within this the jurisdiction of the governing authority, provided, however, that the community development department is not, by sharing such information, in any way representing or warranting that such sites are available or suitable. 
                  (3)  Aesthetics; lighting. The guidelines set forth in this paragraph shall govern the locations of all towers, and the installation of all antennas, governed by this ordinance; provided, however, that the governing authority may waive these requirements if it determines that the goals of this ordinance are better served thereby. The determination whether a proposed tower or antenna meets these requirements shall be within the discretion of the Paulding County Board of Commissioners. This list is not an exclusive list of the aesthetic issues the governing authority may consider; these are merely guidelines. The governing authority may consider any factor that serves the goals and purposes of this ordinance. 
                  (a)  Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, be painted a neutral color, so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness. 
                  (b)  At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures shall use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and built environment. 
                  (c)  If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobstrusive as possible. 
                  (d)  Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the governing authority may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views. 
                  (e)  In designing a tower facility, the aesthetics of the tower shall be considered and the least visually obstrusive design shall be implemented. 
                  (4)  Federal requirements. All towers must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed, then the owners of the towers and antennas governed by this ordinance shall bring such towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six months of the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a more stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal agency. Failure to bring towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at the owner's expense. Any such removal by the governing authority shall be in the manner provided in O.C.G.A. §§ 41-2-8—41-2-17. 
                  (5)  Building codes; safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity of towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries Association, as amended from time to time. If, upon inspection, the governing authority concludes that a tower fails to comply with such codes and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to the owner of the tower, the owner shall have 30 days to bring such tower into compliance with such standards. If the owner fails to bring such tower into compliance within said 30 days, the governing authority may remove such tower at the owner's expense. Any such removal by the governing authority shall be in the manner provided in O.C.G.A. §§ 41-2-8—41-2-17. 
                  (6)  [ Location and development.] Site location and development shall preserve the preexisting character of the surrounding buildings and land uses and the zoning district as much as possible. Personal wireless telecommunication towers shall be integrated through location and design to blend in with existing characteristics of the site to the extent practical. 
                  (7)  [ Vegetation and topography. ] Existing on-site vegetation shall be preserved or improved, and disturbance of the existing topography shall be minimized, unless such disturbance would result in less visual impact of the site to the surrounding area. 
                  (8)  [ Design of related structures. ] At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower and related facilities to the natural setting and built environment. 
                  (9)  [ Number of towers per lot. ] Placement of more than one tower on a lot shall be permitted, provided all setback, design, and landscape requirements are met as to each tower. Structures may be located as close to each other as technically feasible, provided tower failure characteristics of the towers on the site will not lead to multiple failures in the event that one fails. 
                  (10)  [ Maximum height. ] The maximum height for all tower facilities in the county, unless otherwise exempt from these standards as set forth in article III herein, located within all agricultural, residential and commercial zoning categories shall be 195 feet. The maximum height for all tower facilities in the county, unless exempt from these standards as set forth in article III herein, located within all industrial zoning categories shall be 250 feet. 
                  (11)  [ Setback for towers.] Towers must be set back a distance equal to the height of the tower from any residential property line and all public rights-of-way, plus 100 feet. 
                  (12)  [ Setback for accessory facilities; towers in yards.] Towers, guys, and accessory facilities must satisfy the minimum zoning district setback requirements for front, side, and rear yards. In no case shall a tower be located in the required front yard, back yard, or side yard in a residential district. 
                  (13)  [ Historic and scenic views; visual clutter. ] Towers shall not be sited where they will negatively affect historic or scenic view corridors as designated by the governing authority or any state or federal law or agency or where they will create visual clutter. 
                  (14)  [ Fencing. ] Towers shall be enclosed by decay-resistant security fencing installed along the perimeter of the compound not less than six feet in height and shall be equipped with an appropriate anticlimbing device or other similar protective device designed to prevent tower access. 
                  (15)  [ Landscaping. ] The following requirements shall govern the landscaping surrounding towers: 
                  (a)  Tower facilities shall be landscaped with a buffer of plant materials that effectively screen the view of the tower compound from adjacent properties. The standard buffer shall consist of a landscaped strip at least ten feet wide outside the required fence. 
                  (b)  In locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, as determined by the community development department, the landscaping requirement may be reduced or waived altogether. 
                  (c)  Existing mature tree growth and natural land forms on the site shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. In some cases, such as towers sited on large, wooded lots, natural growth around the property perimeter may provide an adequate buffer at the discretion of the community development department. 
                  (16)  [ Design for multiple users. ] Any tower proposed at a height greater than 100 feet, up to 120 feet, shall be designed and intended to accommodate at least three users. Furthermore, for every additional 20 feet of height, said tower shall be designed to accommodate an additional user.

                  (a)  As a part of the consideration for the county's granting to the licensee the rights and privileges of this franchise, the licensee shall pay to the county four (4) per cent of the annual gross receipts of the licensee which are collected from customers in the county, as those limits may from time to time be extended. Installation charges and repair charges shall not be considered as a part of the gross receipts. All other income shall be considered as a part of gross receipts. 
                  The first monies due hereunder shall accrue to the county on the first anniversary date of this grant. Within thirty (30) days thereafter and from then on the following thirty (30) days of each month, the licensee shall pay into an escrow account monthly the sums due under this franchise. The county may draw such funds as needed for the operation of the county, but shall draw them once annually. 
                  (b)  The licensee shall keep complete records of accounts showing dates and payments received. The duly authorized agent appointed by the county shall have the right, power, and authority to inspect and audit the current records of gross revenues of the licensee at any reasonable time. The county shall have the right, at its own expense, to audit the records of gross revenue of the licensee for any annual anniversary. The gross revenue records of the licensee for any annual period shall be closed to the county after three (3) years from the said annual anniversary or after an audit of such records has been made. 
                  (c)  Nothing herein shall be construed as requiring the licensee to pay the county any portion of the revenue derived from the sale of community television service by the licensee to customers residing outside of the county. However, upon the annexation to the county of any territory not now within the county boundaries, the portion of the licensee's facilities that may be located within such annexed territory and upon the roads, highways, or public grounds thereof, shall thereafter be subject to all of the terms of this franchise as though it were an extension made thereunder. 
                  7.  Assignment. 
                  (a)  All of the rights and privileges and all of the obligations, duties, and liabilities created by this franchise shall pass to and be binding upon the successors of the county and the successors and assigns of the licensee, and the same shall not be assigned or transferred without a written notice to and approval of the county. 
                  8.  Requirements to render service. 
                  After installing the basic facilities, the licensee will render regular daily service during customary hours of television broadcasting. 
                  9.  Quality service. 
                  The licensee will undertake to use its best efforts to render satisfactory service to each paid voluntary subscriber within the county. In the event that the licensee, after receiving the initial installation fee from a customer, fails or refuses to render any service within a reasonable time, considering the state of construction and/or conditions beyond the control of the licensee, the county may by written notice, require that the initial installation charge be refunded to the customer. To insure compliance with this provision, the licensee shall post a good and sufficient bond, to be approved by the commissioner, conditioned upon the licensee making the refunds as described above pursuant to the order of the county. The amounts of such bond shall never exceed the sum of $25,000.00 and such bond shall not be required in any amount for any purpose after the expiration of two (2) years from the receipt by the licensee of the first initial connection charge and provided further that in lieu of surety on said bond, the licensee may make such bond without surety and it may pledge as security a deposit of funds of the licensee in any bank or savings and loan association in the county, which deposit shall at all times equal the total potential liability of the licensee under the terms of the bond, not exceeding, however, the total sum of $25,000.00. Before collecting any funds from customers the licensee shall post a bond or establish an account as aforesaid in the amount of $5,000.00. Thereafter, installation fees collected shall be deposited to the account or a similar amount added to the bond until the amount of the bond or the amount of the deposit equals $25,000.00. All interest accruing on any such deposit shall inure to the licensee. 
                  10.  As part of the consideration for this license, the licensee will furnish to the county six (6) free television outlets for such purposes as the county deems expedient. 
                  11.  This license is a nonexclusive license. 
                  12.  The licensee shall at all times operate in compliance with any applicable regulations of the Federal Communications Commission, now in effect or hereafter adopted, regulating the operation of community antenna systems. 
                  13.  Licensees do not obligate themselves to construct these facilities but merely request the right to do so, after the necessary feasibility studies and analysis of other pertinent preliminary data. If licensees have not begun actual construction of these facilities within thirty-six (36) months from this date, this franchise agreement shall be null and void and have no effect. In the event construction of the facilities referred to in this ordinance are prevented by reason of FCC regulations or state or federal law, the time construction is thus prevented will not count in the thirty-six (36) months referred to in this paragraph.

For the purpose of complying with the above, the licensee shall carry property damage and public liability insurance in some responsible insurance company or companies qualified to do business in the State of Georgia, in the following amounts: 
                  (1)  Property damage—$50,000.00 as to any one accident. 
                  (2)  Liability due to injury or death of persons—$300,000.00 as to any one person and $500,000.00 as to any one accident. 
                  In each of said policies the county shall be named as an insured and a copy of each policy or a certificate of insurance shall be delivered to and retained by the county. The licensee shall annually show evidence of advance payments on the aforesaid insurance policy and failure to so do can constitute a breach of this ordinance. 
                  (b)  The county shall notify the licensee within thirty (30) days after the presentation of any claim or demand, either by suit or otherwise, made against the county on account of any negligence as aforesaid on the part of the licensee. 
                  3.  Service and rates. 
                  (a)  The licensee shall maintain and operate its system and render efficient service to residents throughout the county during the term of this franchise. The licensee shall not, as to rates, charges, service facilities, rules and/or regulations, make or grant any preference or advantage to any person nor subject any person to any prejudice or disadvantage; provided, however, this shall not be deemed to prohibit the establishment of a graduated scale of charges and classified rate schedules to which any customer coming within such classification shall be entitled. Rates shall be reasonable and shall be the same for such classifications of customers as are served from identical facilities. All services to be provided hereunder shall be the option of the individual citizen of the county. Nothing herein contained shall be construed as to require the licensee, without adequate compensation, to serve any subscriber so far removed from the licensee facilities that a new pole or poles will be required to furnish said service. 
                  4.  Interference with traffic. 
                  (a)  The facilities, including all structures, lines, and equipment of the licensee, shall be so located or relocated and so erected so as to cause minimum interference with traffic over said streets, alleys, bridges, and public places, and with the reasonable egress and ingress to abutting property. Existing poles, posts, and other structures of the county or of any telephone company or other public utility which may be available to the licensee under the terms hereof or for leasing or licensing, at reasonable terms, shall be used to the extent practicable in order to minimize interference with travel. When any portion of a street is excavated by the licensee in the location or relocation of any of its facilities, the portion of the street or sidewalk so excavated shall, within a reasonable time and as early as practicable after such excavation, be replaced by the licensee at its expense with similar materials and in as good condition as it was at the time of such excavation. If the repairs are not promptly made by the licensee, the county, after reasonable notice to the licensee, may make such repairs as it may deem necessary and charge the same to the licensee. 
                  (b)  In the event that at any time during the period of this franchise the county shall lawfully elect to alter or change any street, alley, easement, or other public way requiring the relocation of the facilities of the licensee, then in such event the licensee, upon reasonable notice by the county, shall remove, relay, and relocate the same at the expense of the licensee. 
                  (c)  The licensee shall, on the request of any person holding a building moving permit issued by the county, temporarily raise or lower its lines to permit the moving of the buildings. The person holding such permit shall be required to give the licensee reasonable notice of the time and place of the proposed move. The licensee shall not be required to raise or lower its lines at an unreasonable time or at a time that would impose an undue hardship on the licensee. The expense of such temporary removal shall be paid by the person requesting the same and the licensee shall have the authority to require such payment in advance. 
                  (d)  The licensee shall have the authority to trim trees upon and overhanging all streets, alleys, easements, sidewalks, and public places of the county as so to prevent the branches of such trees from coming into contact with the facilities of the licensee. The county assumes no liability for such trimming and the licensee will indemnify the county therefor. 
                  (e)  All poles, lines, structures, and other facilities owned by the licensee, in, on, over, and under the streets, sidewalks, alleys, easements, and public grounds or places of the county shall be kept by the licensee at all times in a safe and substantial condition. 
                  (f)  The poles used for the licensee's distribution system shall be those erected and maintained by the utility companies serving the county when and where practicable, provided mutually satisfactory rental agreements can be entered into with the said utility companies. In the event that additional poles need be erected, they will be erected in such manner and at such places as approved and specified by the county. 
                  (g)  The licensee's poles, wires, cables, conductors, and appliances in each and every location shall be located, erected, attached, connected, constructed, and maintained in strict conformity with all of the provisions of the National Electrical Safety Code, sixth edition, and any amendments or revisions of said code and in compliance with any rules or orders now in effect or that hereafter may be issued or adopted by the county, its duly authorized officers and agents or any other authority having jurisdiction. 
                  5.  Term of franchise. 
                  This franchise shall take effect and be in full force from and after the date of the passage of this ordinance and the same shall continue in full force and effect for a term of twenty (20) years. 
                  (a)  Licensee shall be and is hereby given an option to renew this franchise for an additional twenty-year period under the same terms and conditions as set out herein upon the giving of written notice to the county thirty (30) days prior to the time period covered by this ordinance. 
                  (b)  At the expiration of the term of this franchise, the county shall have the right to purchase all of the property used under the term of this franchise or negotiate a new franchise agreement, whichever the county deems more desirable. 
                  6.  Consideration of franchise. 
                  (a)  As part of the consideration for the county's granting to the licensee the rights and privileges of this franchise, the licensee shall pay to the county four (4) per cent of the annual gross receipts of the licensee which are collected from customers in the county. Payment shall be made annually on or before February fifteenth for the preceding year or portion thereof and shall be accompanied by a certified statement of gross revenue derived by the licensee from the operation of the system. This statement shall be audited by a certified public accountant and reports shall be certified by the same accountant. 
                  (b)  Nothing herein shall be construed as requiring the licensee to pay to the county any portion of the revenue derived from the sale of community television service by the licensee to customers residing outside the county or within the incorporated areas of the county. 
                  7.  Assignment. 
                  (a)  All of the rights and privileges and all of the obligations, duties, and liabilities created by this franchise shall pass to and be binding upon the successors of the county and the successors and assigns of the licensee, and the same shall not be assigned or transferred without a written notice to and approval of the county. 
                  8.  Requirements to render service. 
                  After installing the basic facilities, the licensee will render regular daily service during customary hours of television broadcasting. 
                  9.  Quality service. 
                  The licensee will undertake to use its best efforts to render satisfactory service to each paid voluntary subscriber within the county. In the event that the licensee, after receiving the initial installation fee from a customer, fails or refuses to render any service within a reasonable time, considering the state of construction and/or conditions beyond the control of the licensee, the county may by written notice, require that the initial installation charge be refunded to the customer. To insure compliance with this provision, the licensee shall post a good and sufficient bond conditioned upon the licensee making the refunds as described above pursuant to the order of the county. The amounts of such bond shall never exceed the sum of $25,000.00 and such bond shall not be required in any amount for any purpose after the expiration of two (2) years from the receipt by the licensee of the first initial connection charge and provided further that in lieu of surety on said bond, the licensee may make such bond without surety and it may pledge as security a deposit of funds of the licensee in any bank or savings and loan association in the county, which deposit shall at all times equal the total potential liability of the licensee under the terms of the bond, not exceeding, however, the total sum of $25,000.00. Before collecting any funds from customers the licensee shall post a bond or establish an account as aforesaid in the amount of $5,000.00. Thereafter, installation fees collected shall be deposited to the account or a similar amount added to the bond until the amount of the bond or the amount of the deposit equals $25,000.00. All interest accruing on any such deposit shall inure to the licensee. 
                  10.  As part of the consideration for this license and request from the county, licensee shall provide six (6) cost free connections at such locations as the county and licensee might mutually agree upon. The licensee shall also provide at least one educational television channel to its subscribers. 
                  11.  This license is a nonexclusive license. 
                  12.  The licensee shall at all times operate in compliance with any applicable regulations of the Federal Communications Commission, now in effect or hereafter adopted, regulating the operation of community antenna systems. 
                  13.  Licensees do not obligate themselves to construct these facilities but merely request the right to do so after the necessary feasibility studies and analysis of other pertinent preliminary data. If licensees have not begun actual construction of these facilities within thirty-six (36) months from this date, this franchise agreement shall be null and void and have no effect. In the event construction of the facilities referred to in this ordinance are prevented by reason of FCC regulations or state or federal law, the time construction thus prevented will not count in the thirty-six (36) months referred to in this paragraph. 
                  14.  The effective date of this ordinance shall be the date of its passage.

                  (d)  The poles used for licensee's distribution system shall be those erected and maintained by the utility companies serving the county when and where practicable, provided mutually satisfactory rental agreements can be entered into with said utility companies. In the event that additional poles need be erected, they will be erected in such manner and at such places as approved and specified by the county.

                  A certificate of insurance shall be delivered to and retained by the county. The licensee shall annually show evidence of advance payments on the aforesaid insurance policy and failure to so do can constitute a breach of this ordinance.

                  This franchise shall take effect and be in full force from and after the date of the passage of this ordinance and the same shall continue in full force and effect for a term of fifteen (15) years from the date of this modification.

                  The licensee will undertake to use its best efforts to render satisfactory service to each paid voluntary subscriber within the county. In the event that the licensee, after receiving the initial installation fee from a customer, fails or refuses to render any service within a reasonable time, considering the state of construction and/or conditions beyond the control of the licensee, the county may by written notice, require that the initial installation charge be refunded to the customer. To insure compliance with this provision, the licensee shall furnish a performance bond or cash deposit for the amount of $10,000.00. The cash deposit or performance bond shall be released once the licensee has provided service to eighty (80) per cent of those customers desiring cable television who reside within the planned area of construction. The county commissioners will be furnished a copy of proposed construction areas within ten (10) days after approval of this ordinance. All interest accruing on any cash deposit shall insure to the licensee. 
                  The Paulding County comptroller will establish procedures to provide resolution of problems which cannot be resolved between the customer and licensee.

                  MODIFICATION OF CABLE TV FRANCHISE GRANTED SEPTEMBER 26, 1978 
                  Whereas, a franchise for cable television was granted by Paulding County to W. A. Foster, III, W. A. Foster, Jr., John Foster and Herman Watts on September 26, 1978; and 
                  Whereas, the commission of Paulding County consented to an assignment of said franchise from the above named individuals to Paulding Cablevision, Inc. on May 13, 1980; and 
                  Whereas, on July 22, 1980, the commission of Paulding County approved and enacted a modification to the cable TV franchise approving the assignment of said franchise to Paulding Cablevision Associates and modifying the franchise in certain other particulars; and 
                  Whereas, on March 10, 1981, the commission of Paulding County approved and enacted a modification to the cable TV franchise approving a collateral assignment of the right, title and interest of Paulding Cablevision Associates under the ordinance to Bank of the South, N.A.; and 
                  Whereas, the parties to said cable franchise agreement hereby desire to modify the terms thereof in certain particulars; 
                  Therefore, said cable TV franchise agreement is hereby modified in the following particulars: 
                  1.  The commission of Paulding County hereby consents to an assignment of said cable TV franchise agreement to Tele-Media Company of Paulding County. 
                  2.  Subparagraph (b) of paragraph 5 entitled "Term of franchise" in the cable TV franchise granted on September 26, 1978, shall be modified by deleting subparagraph (b) and adding the following new subparagraph (b): 
                  "(b) At the expiration of the term for which this franchise is granted or at the expiration of the twenty-year renewal period, whichever is later, or upon its cancellation, the county, at its election, shall have the option for a period of thirty (30) days to purchase and take over licensee's distribution system in its entirety (the 'option'). Upon the exercise of its option by the county and its service of an official notice of such action upon the licensee, the county shall have ninety (90) days in which to reach a definitive purchase agreement with the licensee. The transfer to the county of the possession and title to all the equipment and property, real and personal, of the distribution system shall not occur until the purchase price for the distribution system has been paid to the licensee, whereupon any grant conferred upon the licensee by this ordinance shall cease and determine. 
                  The following factors shall be taken into account in determining the purchase price of the distribution system as a going concern business (the 'purchase price'): (a) the original cost of the equipment and property, including buildings and real estate, of the licensee used or useful for the operation of the distribution system; (b) the then current highest market value of such equipment and property as used as an integral part of the distribution system; (c) the purchase price paid for the purchase of systems comparable to licensee's distribution system; and (d) the cash flow income derived or to be derived from licensee's distribution system. As used herein, 'cash flow income' shall mean that income after all expenses but before interest, depreciation and capital expenditures. The purchase price for licensee's distribution system shall not be less than the then current highest market value of licensee's distribution system or the original cost thereof, less reasonable accrued depreciation, whichever is the higher. During the aforesaid ninety (90) day period, if any disagreement shall arise between the licensee and the county with respect to the calculation of the purchase price for licensee's distribution system, the licensee and the county shall each appoint an appraiser and the two (2) appraisers shall in turn appoint a third appraiser. If the two (2) appraisers are unable to agree upon a third appraiser, one shall be appointed by the state court which has jurisdiction over disputes arising in Paulding County, Georgia. The three (3) appraisers so selected shall then proceed to appraise licensee's distribution system as a going concern business in accordance with the procedures set forth above and shall deliver such appraisals on or before the expiration of the aforesaid ninety (90) day period. The purchase price shall be determined by averaging the two (2) highest appraisals. The costs of such appraisals shall be shared equally by the county and the licensee." 
                  3.  Paragraph 7 entitled "Assignment" in the franchise agreement granted on September 26, 1978, shall be modified by inserting the following new subparagraph (b): 
                  "(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the county hereby authorizes Tele-Media Company of Paulding County to cease to do business as a limited partnership and to incorporate or to assign, alienate or transfer its rights hereunder or to permit its ownership interest or stock, as the case may be, to be assigned, alienated or transferred to Tele-Media Corporation or any of Tele-Media Corporation's subsidiaries or affiliates or to any other entity, provided that Tele-Media Corporation maintains control over the entity and over the day-to-day operations of the system. For the purposes of this paragraph, the term 'control' is not limited to majority ownership, but includes actual working control in whatever manner exercised." 
                  4.  Paragraphs 1 and 2 in said March 10, 1981 ordinance shall be modified to read as follows: 
                  "1. The county hereby approves of and consents to the financing of the system and approved of and consents to the collateral assignment of, grant of a security interest in, or other encumbrance of all or any part of the right, title, and interest of Tele-Media Company of Paulding County under and in the ordinance and all amendments or modifications thereto and in the franchise and system, including without limitation all of the assets, property, franchise rights and interests of Tele-Media Company of Paulding County, to any lender pursuant to one or more security agreements or other collateral documents, including without limitation, security deeds. 
                  2. In the event of the foreclosure pursuant to any collateral assignment, security agreements, or other document executed by Tele-Media Company of Paulding County pursuant to the foregoing paragraph, the county hereby approves and consents to the transfer and assignment of all right, title, and interest of Tele-Media Company of Paulding County under and in the ordinance and all amendments or modifications thereto and in the franchise and system, and any and all other assets or rights of Tele-Media Company of Paulding County, to any purchaser(s) or transferee(s) at a foreclosure sale or other disposition under any of such collateral assignment, security agreement or other document, or for the lender, its successors, assigns, or transferees to hold and own such rights, titles and interests upon the enforcement of any security interests, and to the operation of the system pursuant to and in accordance with the ordinance as amended and modified by such purchasers, transferees or security interest holders or their transferees." 
                  5.  All other provisions contained in said cable TV franchise agreement granted to W. A. Foster, Jr., W. A. Foster, III, John E. Foster and Herman Watts on September 26, 1978, as amended, which are not modified herein shall remain in full force and effect as contained in said franchise agreement.

                  AN ORDINANCE FOR PAULDING COUNTY

Nothing herein shall be construed as in any way limiting or confining the operation of the community television system contemplated hereby from being expanded by the licensee as to provide community television service to adjacent or contiguous municipalities or communities. 
                  (c)  Wherever used in the ordinance, the word "television" shall mean a system for simultaneous transmission of audio signals and transmission of audio signals and transient visual images by means of electrical impulses. 
                  (d)  The poles used for licensee's distribution system shall be those erected and maintained by the utility companies serving the county when and where practicable, provided mutually satisfactory rental agreements can be entered into with said utility companies. In the event that additional poles need be erected, they will be erected in such manner and at such places as approved and specified by the county. Said poles must meet county and state requirements with respect to their specifications, size, and length, but in any event, the cable itself must be at least 14 feet above ground. 
                  2.  Responsibility for damages. 
                  (a)  The county shall, in no way, be liable or responsible for any accident or damage that may occur in the construction, operation, or maintenance by the licensee of its facilities hereunder, and the licensee does agree hereby to indemnify the county and hold it harmless against any and all liability, loss, cost, damage or expense, which may accrue to the county by reason of the neglect or default of the licensee in the construction, operation, or maintenance of its facilities hereunder. The licensee shall be solely responsible for ascertaining widths of right-of-way on county streets and alleys.

                  In each of said policies the county shall be named as an insured and a copy of each policy or a certificate of insurance shall be delivered to and retained by the county. The licensee shall annually show evidence of advance payments on the aforesaid insurance policy and failure to so do can constitute a breach of this ordinance. 
                  (b)  The county shall notify the licensee within thirty (30) days after the presentation of any claim or demand, either by suit or otherwise, made against the county on account of any negligence as foresaid on the part of the licensee.

                  (a)  The licensee shall maintain and operate its system and render efficient service to residents throughout the county during the term of this franchise. The licensee shall not, as to rates, charges, service facilities, rules and/or regulations, make or grant any preference or advantage to any person nor subject any person to any prejudice or disadvantage; provided, however, this shall not be deemed to prohibit the establishment of a graduated scale of charges and classified rate schedules to which any customer coming within such classification shall be entitled. Rates shall be reasonable and shall be the same for such classifications of customers as are served from identical facilities. All services to be provided hereunder shall be the option of the individual citizen of the county. Nothing herein contained shall be construed as to require the licensee, without adequate compensation, to serve any subscriber so far removed from the licensee facilities that a new pole or poles will be required to furnish said service. However, licensee shall expand and provide services and community television facilities by extension of existing transmission lines upon the application of twenty-five (25) customers per mile from the terminal point of existing transmission lines and facilities.

                  (a)  The facilities, including all structures, lines, and equipment of the licensee, shall be so located and relocated and so erected so as to cause minimum interference with traffic over said streets, alleys, bridges, and public place, and with reasonable egress and ingress to abutting property.

When any portion of a street is excavated by the licensee in the location or relocation of any of its facilities, the portion of the street or sidewalk so excavated shall, within a reasonable time and as early as practicable after such excavation, be replaced by the licensee at its expense with similar materials and in as good condition as it was at the time of such excavation. If the repairs are not promptly made by the licensee, the county, after reasonable notice to the licensee, may make such repairs as it may deem necessary and charge the same to the licensee. 
                  (b)  In the event that at any time during the period of this franchise the county shall lawfully elect to alter or change any street, alley, easement, or other public way requiring the relocation of the facilities of the licensee, then in such event the licensee, upon reasonable notice by the county shall remove, relay, and relocate the same at the expense of the licensee. 
                  (c)  The licensee shall, on the request of any person holding a building moving permit issued by the county, temporarily raise or lower its lines to permit to moving of the buildings. The person holding such permit shall be required to give the licensee reasonable notice of the time and place of the proposed move. The licensee shall not be required to raise or lower its lines at an unreasonable time or at a time that would impose an undue hardship on the licensee. The expense of such temporary removal shall be paid by the person requesting the same and the licensee shall have the authority to require such payment in advance. 
                  (d)  The licensee shall have the authority to trim trees upon and overhanging all streets, alleys, easements, sidewalks, and public places of the county so as to prevent the branches of such trees from coming into contact with the facilities of the licensee.

                  (f)  The poles used for the licensee's distribution system shall be those erected and maintained by the utility companies serving the county when and where practicable provided mutually satisfactory rental agreements can be entered into with the said utility companies. In the event that additional poles need be erected, they will be erected in such manner and at such places as approved and specified by the county. 
                  (g)  The licensee's poles, wires, cables, conductors, and appliances in each and every location shall be located, erected, attached, connected, constructed, and maintained in strict conformity with all of the provisions of the National Electrical Safety Code, Sixth Edition, and any amendments or revisions of said code and in compliance with any rules or orders now in effect or that hereafter may be issued or adopted by the county, its duly authorized officers and agents or any other authority having jurisdiction. 
                  5.  Term of franchise. 
                  This franchise shall take effect and be in full force from and after the date of the passage of this ordinance and the same shall continue in full force and effect for a term of twenty (20) years.

Upon the exercise of its option by the county and its service of an official notice of such action upon the licensee, the county shall have ninety (90) days in which to reach a definitive purchase agreement with the licensee. The transfer to the county of the possession and title to all the equipment and property, real and personal, of the distribution system has been paid to the licensee, whereupon any grant conferred upon the licensee by this ordinance shall cease and determine [terminate]. The following factors shall be taken into account in determining the purchase price of the distribution system as a going concern business (the purchase price): 
                  (a)  The original cost of the equipment and property, including buildings and real estate, of the licensee used or useful for the operation of the distribution system; 
                  (b)  The then current highest market value of such equipment and property as used as an integral part of the distribution system; 
                  (c)  The purchase price paid for the purchase of systems comparable to licensee's distribution system; and 
                  (d)  The cash flow income derived or to be derived from licensee's distribution system. As used here cash flow income shall mean that income after all expenses but before interest, depreciation and capital expenditures. 
                  The purchase price for licensee's distribution system shall not be less than the then current highest market value of licensee's distribution system or the original cost thereof, less reasonable accrued depreciation, whichever is the higher. During the aforesaid ninety (90) day period, if any disagreement shall arise between the licensee and the county with respect to the calculation of the purchase price for licensee's distribution system, the licensee and the county shall each appoint an appraiser and the two appraisers shall in turn appoint a third appraiser. If the two appraisers are unable to agree upon a third appraiser, one shall be appointed by the state court which has jurisdiction over disputes arising in Paulding County, Georgia. The three appraisers so selected shall then proceed to appraise licensee's distribution system as a going concern business in accordance with the procedures set forth above and shall deliver such appraisals on or before the expiration of the aforesaid ninety (90) day period. The purchase price shall be determined by averaging the two highest appraisals. The cost of such appraisals shall be shared equally by the county and licensee. 
                  6.  Consideration of franchise. 
                  (a)  As part of the consideration for the county's granting to the licensee the rights and privileges of this franchise the licensee shall pay to the county four percent of the annual gross receipts of the licensee collected for its basic service from customers in the county for providing community television system hookups and services and monthly subscription fees. Payment shall be made annually on or before February 15 for the preceding year or portion thereof and shall be accompanied by a certified statement of gross revenue derived from its basic service by the licensee from the operation of the system. This statement and report shall be reviewed by a certified public accountant.

If licensees have not begun actual construction of these facilities within 36 months of this date, this franchise agreement shall be null and void and have no effect. In the event construction of the facilities referred to in this ordinance are prevented by reason of FCC Regulations or state or federal law, the time construction thus prevented will not count in the 36 months referred to in this paragraph.
