PREFACE

         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Crawfordville, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1974 Code, as updated through July 7, 2009, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1974 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Michael E. Raabe, Code Attorney, and Ellen K. Torof, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to J. H. Milner, Mayor, and James T. Jones, City Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

                  --- (1) --- 
                  Editor's note—Printed herein is the Charter of the city, as adopted by 1975 Ga. Laws (Act No. 107), page 2986). Amendments to the Charter are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original act. Obvious misspellings have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes, a uniform system of headings, catchlines and citations to state statutes has been used. The title, enactment, severability, repealer, transitional, ratification, publication and effective date provisions have been omitted, and where a section has been amended or repealed by a later provision, only the current language has been printed. Additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets.

                  ARTICLE II. - CITY COUNCIL 

                  Sec. 2.01. - Election of mayor and councilmen. 
                  On the second Wednesday in October 1975, and quadrennially thereafter there shall be held an election for the purpose of electing a mayor and four councilmen. For the purpose of electing councilmen, positions on the city council shall be numbered one through four, respectively.

                  Candidates elected to office in said elections shall take office on the 1st Tuesday in November following their election and shall serve for a term of office of four years and until their successors are duly elected and qualified. The mayor and council shall have the power to provide the exact manner in which, and place where, elections shall take place; to require the preservation of good order and to prevent disturbance or interference with the free right to vote. The mayor shall appoint three freeholders or one justice of the peace and two freeholders of the city, to manage all elections. Each manager, before entering on his duties, shall take the following oath before some judge or justice of the peace: "I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully and impartially conduct the election for which I am appointed manager, and will prevent all illegal voting, to the best of my ability and power, so help me God." The mayor shall provide, at the city's expense, all necessary material for use of managers in elections. 
                  The mayor and council may prescribe, by ordinance, how votes may be challenged; how the returns of all elections shall be made and the results declared; and also how contests of any election shall be conducted, and to prescribe all rules and regulations for the proper conduct of all elections in said city. 
                  Editor's note— O.C.G.A. § 21-2-9 controls the dates of elections. Elections have been moved to the first Tuesday in November. Elected officers take office on the first day of January in the year following the election. The conduct of elections has been placed under the Taliaferro County Supervisor of Elections pursuant to Resolution No. 2007-02, 3-6-2007. 
                  Sec. 2.02. - City council. 
                  The mayor and four councilmen shall compose the city council, in which is vested all corporate, legislative and other powers of the city, except as otherwise provided in this Act. The council shall be the final judge of the election and qualifications of its members, also of the amount and manner of compensating them for their services, provided that any increase in council compensation shall not take effect until after the first city election following the adoption of the compensation ordinance. The council shall meet on the first Tuesday of each month. The council shall meet in special session on written notice, which has been served on the other members personally or left at their residences at least twelve hours in advance of the meeting, or notice of meeting is waived in writing. Notice of a special meeting shall not be required if the mayor and all councilmen are present at the time the special meeting is called to order. Only the business stated in the written call may be transacted at a special meeting, except by unanimous consent of all members of the council. The council shall exercise its powers in public meetings. A majority of the council shall constitute a quorum. The council may, by ordinance, adopt rules and bylaws to govern the conduct of its business; including procedures and penalties for compelling the attendance of absent members. The council may subpoena and examine witnesses, may order the production of books and papers, punish for refusal to obey an order or subpoena, or for disorderly or contemptuous behavior in the presence of the council. 
                  Sec. 2.03. - Mayor as presiding officer. 
                  The mayor shall preside at meetings of the council, shall have a vote in all instances, but no veto power; shall be the ceremonial head of the city, shall sign ordinances and resolutions on their final passage; shall sign deeds, bonds, and contracts when authorized by the council to do so; shall be the officer to accept process against the city; and shall perform other duties imposed by this Act and ordinances not inconsistent with this Act. 
                  (2001 Ga. Laws, page 3723)
                  Sec. 2.04. - Vice mayor. 
                  The council at the first regular meeting, after the newly elected council members have taken office following each annual election, shall elect from its membership a vice mayor for a term of four years. In the event that no decision is reached at such first regular meeting, the council shall, within five ballots to be taken within ten days following such meeting, elect the vice mayor; otherwise the council members who received the highest number of votes, when he or she was last elected, shall become vice mayor. The vice mayor shall perform the duties of the mayor during the mayor's absence or inability to act, in which case a new vice mayor shall be elected by majority vote of the council. 
                  (2001 Ga. Laws, page 3723)
                  Sec. 2.05. - Vacancy in office of mayor or councilmember. 
                  A vacancy shall exist if the mayor or a councilmember resigns, dies, moves his or her residence from the city, or has been continuously disabled for a period of six months, so as to prevent him or her from discharging the duties of his or her office, or if he or she accepts any federal, state, county, or other municipal office or position of employment except as a magistrate or member of the National Guard or other reserve components of the U. S. Armed Forces; or if he or she is convicted of malfeasance or misfeasance in office, or of a felony, or violation of this Act; or any violation of the election laws of the state. In the event of a vacancy in the office of mayor, the vice mayor shall fill out the unexpired term in the office of mayor if there shall be six months or less remaining to be served in such term. If, however, there shall be more than six months remaining to be served in such term, a special election shall be called to be held in the city to elect a person to fill out the balance of the unexpired term in the office of mayor. In the event of a vacancy in the office of a councilmember, if there shall be six months or less remaining in the term to be served by such councilmember, the mayor and council shall immediately appoint, by majority vote among themselves, another person to serve for said remaining term of six months or less. If, however, there shall be more than six months remaining to be served in the term of said councilmember, a special election shall be called by the mayor and council to be held in the city to elect person to fill out such unexpired term. In the interim period between the occurrence of the vacancy and the election of a new councilmember the mayor and council shall appoint an interim appointee to serve until the election is held. Such interim appointee may, if he or she desires, be a candidate in such election. 
                  (2001 Ga. Laws, page 3723)
                  Sec. 2.06. - City clerk. 
                  The mayor and council shall appoint a city clerk, who shall be responsible for keeping and preserving the city seal and all records of the council; attending meetings of the council and keeping a journal of its proceedings at such meetings, including the names of members present and absent, the decision on each question, each motion considered, and the title of each resolution or ordinance considered; preparing and certifying copies of official records in his office, for which fees may be prescribed by ordinance; and performing such other duties as may be required by the council or mayor. Salary of the city clerk and his term of office shall be as prescribed by the mayor and council. 
                  Sec. 2.07. - City legislation.

                  There may be an appeal in any case from the recorder's or mayor's court to the mayor and council, which appeal must be in writing and entered within two days after the judgment complained of is pronounced; and provided, further, that the defendant gives bond, with security, to abate the final judgment of the case, said bond and security to be approved by the arresting officer or chief of police. The said mayor and council shall as early thereafter as is practicable, hear and determine the said case so appealed, and shall investigate the case as fully as if the same had never been tried, that is, de novo. They shall have the power, if they find the defendant guilty, to decrease the fine or sentence imposed by the recorder's court, or to increase it at their discretion; and the judgment of the mayor and council may be reviewed by certiorari to the Superior Court of Taliaferro County, as is provided for in sections 19-203 to 19-216, both inclusive, of the Code of Georgia of 1933, and any Act amendatory thereof.

If the offense charged in the warrant be one against the laws or ordinances of the city, the arresting officer shall carry the case before the recorder's court and none other, and the same there be disposed of as other cases of arrest not made under warrant. All warrants issued by the recorder, or those acting in his stead, shall be directed to the Chief of Police of Crawfordville, any policeman or marshal thereof, and to all and singular the sheriffs, deputy sheriffs and constable of this State, and any one of said officers shall have the same authority to execute said warrant as the sheriffs of this State have to execute criminal warrants.

                  Any police officer of the City of Crawfordville shall have authority to release any person arrested for a violation of any law or ordinance of said city, or law over which the recorder may have jurisdiction, upon such person giving bond, with security, payable to the City of Crawfordville in an amount and surety to be approved by the policeman or as directed by the city recorder, conditioned for the appearance of such person before the recorder's court at the time and place specified in said bond and from time to time until he or she shall have been tried for the offense for which charged. 
                  If any person so released under appearance bond shall fail to appear for trial at the time named therein, such bond shall be forfeited; and a rule nisi shall be issued requiring him or the surety upon such bond to show cause before said court, at a time not less than ten days from the date of such rule, why such bond shall not be absolutely forfeited. Copies of such rule shall be served upon such person or persons to whom it shall be directed at least five days before the return days thereof, provided service may be made personally or by mailing a written notice to such person or persons at their last known address. At the time such rule is made returnable and no sufficient cause to be shown, the forfeiture of said bond shall be final and absolute, and execution shall issue for the full amount thereof, and all costs, in the same amounts as are applicable in such cases in the superior courts, against the principal and sureties thereon or such of them as shall have been served. Such execution shall be signed by the Clerk of the City of Crawfordville and the recorder and shall be directed as warrants are directed, set out hereinabove, and the same when so issued shall be a lien upon all property, real or personal of such parties, and binding effect upon such property and of the defendant and surety therein as if the same were issued upon judgments in the superior courts, and shall be levied by any officer to whom it shall be directed; provided, however, that any police officer of said city may require cash bonds for the appearance of such arrested person or persons, and upon their failure to appear at the trial thereof, said cash bond may be regarded as a fine and so assessed by said recorder and paid into the treasury of the city, in the discretion of the city recorder, or those acting in his stead.

The pages of a supplement shall be so numbered that they will fit properly into the Code and will, where necessary, replace pages that have become obsolete or partially obsolete; and the new pages shall be so prepared that, when they have been inserted, the Code will be current through the date of the adoption of the latest ordinance included in the supplement. 
                  (b)	In preparing a supplement to this Code, all portions of the Code that have been repealed shall be excluded from the Code by their omission from reprinted pages.

                  (2)	Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles.

                  (4)	Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case may be, or to "sections ____________ to ____________" (inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code that embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code). 
                  (5)	Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meanings of ordinance sections inserted into the Code; 
                  but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code. 
                  Sec. 1-10. - Altering Code.

Each day any violation of this Code or of any ordinance shall continue shall constitute a separate offense.

If, in his discretion, such employee determines that identity theft or attempted identity theft is likely or probable, such employee shall immediately report such red flags to the city clerk and mayor. If, in his discretion, such employee deems that identity theft is unlikely or that reliable information is available to reconcile red flags, the employee shall convey this information to the city clerk and mayor, who may in their discretion determine that no further action is necessary. If the city clerk and mayor, in their discretion determine that further action is necessary, a city employee shall perform one or more of the following responses, as determined to be appropriate by the city clerk and mayor:

                  Freeboard means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed. 
                  Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, adjacent to the proposed foundation of a building. 
                  Historic structure means any structure that is:

                  Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement. An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, used solely for the parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a basement, is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of other provisions of this Code. 
                  Manufactured home means a building, transportable in one or more sections, built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and similar transportable structures placed on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer and intended to be improved property. 
                  Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.

                  National Geodetic Vertical Datum or (NGVD), as corrected in 1929, means a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
                  New construction means, for the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the start of construction commenced after the effective date of the initial FIRM and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, the term "new construction" means structures for which the start of construction commenced after September 12, 2000, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
                  New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed after September 12, 2000. 
                  North American Vertical Datum or (NAVD) has replaced the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 in existing and future FEMA Flood Modernization Maps. 
                  Recreational vehicle means a vehicle, which is: 
                  (1)	Built on a single chassis;

                  Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (Note: Accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance requirements.) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, or a gas or liquid storage tank.

                  Substantial improvement. 
                  (1)	The term "substantial improvement" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the "start of construction" of the improvement. Note: The market value of the structure should be: The appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. The term "substantial improvement" includes structures, which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. For the purposes of this definition, the term "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  (2)	The term "substantial improvement" does not, however, include:
                  a.	Those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project; or 
                  b.	Any alteration of a historic structure provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions means where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. 
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  Sec. 22-2. - Penalties for violation. 
                  Failure to comply with the provisions of this chapter or with any of its requirements, including conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants of variance or special exceptions shall constitute a violation. Any person who violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than $1,000.00 or imprisoned for not more than 30 days, or both, and in addition, shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Each day such violation continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the city from taking such other lawful actions as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.

                  Sec. 22-3. - Findings of fact. 
                  (a)	The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation, which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (b)	These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities.

                  Sec. 22-4. - Statement of purpose. 
                  It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)	Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)	Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)	Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
                  (4)	Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and 
                  (5)	Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.

                  ARTICLE III. - PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

                  Sec. 22-64. - General standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard, the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)	New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure; 
                  (2)	New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage; 
                  (3)	New construction or substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
                  (4)	Elevated buildings. All new construction or substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater, as follows: 
                  a.	Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
                  1.	Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
                  2.	The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and
                  3.	Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both directions; 
                  b.	So as not to violate the lowest floor criteria of this chapter, the unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area; and 
                  c.	The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms; 
                  (5)	All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding; 
                  (6)	Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces; 
                  (7)	New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system; 
                  (8)	New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters; 
                  (9)	On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding; and 
                  (10)	Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure, which is not compliant with the provisions of this chapter, shall be undertaken only if the nonconformity is not furthered, extended or replaced.

                  Sec. 22-65. - Specific standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard, the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)	New construction and/or substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and/or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 22-64(4), pertaining to elevated buildings. All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  (2)	Nonresidential construction. New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in an A1-30, AE, or AH zone may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth in this section and in section 22-44(7). 
                  (3)	Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
                  a.	All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on:
                  1.	Individual lots or parcels;
                  2.	In new and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions;
                  3.	In expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions; or
                  4.	On a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as the result of a flood; 
                  must have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  b.	Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
                  1.	The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or 
                  2.	The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
                  c.	All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. 
                  d.	All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either:
                  1.	Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days;
                  2.	Be fully licensed and ready for highway use (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick-disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions); or 
                  3.	Meet all the requirements for new construction, including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsections (3)a—c of this section. 
                  (4)	Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 22-7 are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights; therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  a.	Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
                  b.	Only if subsection (4)a of this section is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this article.

                  (1)	When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 22-7, then the land development officer shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of this article. Only if data are not available from these sources, then subsections (2) and (3) of this section shall apply. 
                  (2)	No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 20 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in more than a one-foot increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
                  (3)	In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. (Note: Require the lowest floor to be elevated one foot above the estimated base flood elevation in A-zone areas where a limited detail study has been completed.) Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with the standards of subsection 22-64(4), pertaining to elevated buildings. 
                  (4)	All heating and air conditioning equipment and components, including ductwork, and all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. 
                  (5)	The land development officer shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file.

                  (b)	The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the land development officer in the enforcement or administration of this chapter.

                  (d)	Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (e)	Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (f)	Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (g)	In reviewing such requests, the planning commission shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this chapter.

                  (1)	A variance shall be issued only when there is:
                  a.	A finding of good and sufficient cause;
                  b.	A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  c.	A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  (2)	The provisions of this chapter are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore, any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of a historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (3)	Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (4)	The land development officer shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (i)	Upon consideration of the factors listed in this section and the purposes of this chapter, the planning commission may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

                  2.	As a result of such unusual circumstance or conditions, there is an unnecessary hardship or practical difficulty that renders it difficult to carry out the provisions of this Title. 
                  3.	The authorization of such variance will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to property in the vicinity or zoning district in which property is located, and the variance will be in harmony with the general purposes and intent of the provisions of this Title. 
                  4.	The variance approved is the minimum variance that will make possible the legal use of the land, building or structure. 
                  5.	The variance does not permit a use of land, building or structure which is not permitted by right in the zoning district in which the proposed development is located.

                  Sec. 8.2. - Nonconforming situations. 
                  Within the zoning districts established by this Article, there exist buildings, structures and uses that could not be built or established under the provisions herein but were lawful when previously built or established. This Article recognizes the legitimate interests of those who have lawfully established buildings, structures or uses which are nonconforming by permitting such nonconformities to be continued. This Article also recognizes how nonconforming buildings, structures and uses can inhibit Crawfordville's ability to promote orderly growth and development, and includes measures intended to facilitate the conversion of such situations to a state of conformity with current land development practices. 
                  Sec. 8.2.1. - Nonconforming lots.

                  Sec. 8.2.2. - Expansion of nonconforming buildings and structures. 
                  A nonconforming building or structure, as defined in Article I of this Article [Appendix] may be expanded, enlarged, or extended if such expansion, enlargement, or extension is for a use that conforms to the requirements for the zoning district in which the building or structure is located. Any such expansion, enlargement, or extension of a nonconforming building or structure shall meet the minimum yard, setback, buffer, and any other dimensional requirements for the district in which said nonconforming building or structure is located. 
                  Sec. 8.2.3. - Nonconforming uses. 
                  A use of land, building, or structure which, at the time of the enactment or amendment of this Article, does not comply with the use provisions for the zoning district in which it is located as established in Article VI [of this appendix], may be continued subject to the following conditions: 
                  1.	The nonconforming use shall not be changed to another nonconforming use. A change in tenancy or ownership shall not be considered a change to another nonconforming use, provided that the use itself remains unchanged; 
                  2.	A nonconforming use shall not be re-established after discontinuance for one year. Vacancy and/or non-use of the building, regardless of the intent of the owner or tenant, shall constitute discontinuance under this provision. If a business registration is required for said nonconforming use and the business registration pertaining to said use has lapsed in excess of six months, said lapse of business registration shall constitute discontinuance; 
                  3.	The nonconforming use shall not be expanded, enlarged or extended, in land area or in floor space or volume of space in a building or structure, except for a use which complies with the use district in which said use is located; or, 
                  4.	The nonconforming use shall not be rebuilt, altered or repaired after damage exceeding 50 percent of its replacement cost at the time of damage as determined by the building official, except for a use that conforms with the use district in which said use is located, and provided such rebuilding, alteration or repair is completed within one year of such damage. 
                  5.	The right to continue a nonconforming use is conditional and may be continued for only so long as the nonconforming activity is conducted lawfully and does not produce a condition that violates city codes. The use of a property in any manner that creates a violation of city code shall construe abandonment of the use and shall terminate the right to continue the nonconforming use. Such abandonment must not have to continue for one year as stated in Sec. 8.2.3.2.

                  ARTICLE IX. - OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING 

                  Sec. 9.1. - Applicability. 
                  Within all zoning districts except the C-1 District and MHP District, there shall be provided minimum off-street parking spaces with adequate means of ingress and egress from a public street or alley by a motor vehicle of standard size. Such off-street parking requirements shall be met at the time of erection of any principal building or structure, or at any time any principal building or structure is enlarged or increased in capacity by adding dwelling units, guest rooms, floor space or seats. 
                  Sec. 9.2. - Required spaces. 
                  Required off-street parking spaces for all uses, unless located within the C-1 and MHP Districts as established in Sections 9.2.1 and 9.2.2, shall be subject to the provisions provided in Table 3. In some cases a specific land use which is allowed under the provisions of this Article and identified in Article VII, Table 1 may be proposed that is not referenced within Table 3. In such instances, it shall be the responsibility of the Land Development Officer to determine the most applicable land use which matches the intended use for the purpose of applying required off-street parking requirements. 

                   
                  Sec. 9.2.1. - C-1 District off-street parking requirements. 
                  It is the intention of the C-1 District to promote a pedestrian-friendly development pattern where buildings are placed close to the street, parking is obscured and pedestrian movement is not obstructed by multiple curb cuts leading to motor vehicle parking areas. Such a pattern is consistent with, and seeks to propagate, the built environment which currently exists in downtown Crawfordville where many building sites are small and have limited vehicular access. In addition, many of the public streets in the area include on-street parking facilities which can serve some parking needs that can not be met in areas of contemporary development. Due to these special considerations, application of minimum off-street parking requirements for buildings, structures and uses within the C-1 District shall be considered on a case-by-case basis. When considering whether off-street parking is to be required for a building, structure or use proposed for the C-1 District, and the amount, the Land Development Officer shall consider at least the following: 
                  1.	Is there adequate space on the site to provide for off-street parking in conformance with all other design provisions in this Article, and will the percentage of the site to be used for off-street parking constitute a greater percentage of the site than the principal structure; 
                  2.	Will access to off-street parking cause a disruption to pedestrian mobility in the area; 
                  3.	Will existing buildings of historic significance have to be removed in order to provide off-street parking areas; 
                  4.	Are on-street parking spaces accessible to the building site and will they be adequate to meet some or all of the parking needs generated by the use; 
                  5.	Will the lack of off-street parking result in a condition that inhibits traffic flow in the vicinity of the site; and, 
                  6.	Does the provision of off-street parking detract from the aesthetics of the historic downtown area? 
                  When conditions allow, all other standards for parking set forth in this Article shall be met within the C-1 district. 
                  Sec. 9.2.2. - MHP District off-street parking requirements. 
                  Off-street parking for uses within the MHP District shall be provided in accordance with the provisions of section 12.6.4.c [of this appendix].

                  2.	Parking spaces for other uses shall be provided on the same lot or not more than 300 feet distance, measured along the nearest pedestrian walkway. 
                  3.	Parking requirements for two or more uses of the same or different types may be satisfied by the allocation of the required number of spaces for each use in a common parking facility, provided, that the total number of spaces is not less than the sum of the individual requirements and that the requirements of location are complied with. 
                  4.	Parking spaces for dwelling structures shall be located back of the building line.
                  5.	Areas reserved for off-street parking or loading shall not be reduced in area or changed to any other use unless the permitted use which it serves is discontinued or modified, or unless equivalent parking or loading is provided on another approved site or parking structure to the satisfaction of the Land Development Officer. 
                  6.	Lighting facilities shall be so arranged that light is reflected away from adjacent properties. 
                  7.	Along lot lines of a parking area which abut a residential district, a dense planting of trees and shrubs shall be established on a strip of land not less than eight (8) feet in width adjacent to the districts, and such planting shall not be less than six (6) feet in height and a substantial bumper rail of wood, metal, or concrete shall be installed on the inside of the planting strip except where topography or other conditions would make the bumper rail unnecessary.

                  Sec. 9.6. - Parking area design. 
                  Off-street parking spaces shall be provided within a parking area meeting the following design parameters: 
                  1.	Parking stalls shall have a minimum width of nine (9) feet and length of 18 feet.
                  2.	There shall be provided adequate interior driveways to connect each parking space with a public right-of-way.

                  Sec. 9.8. - Right-of-way. 
                  No sign, whether permanent or temporary, shall be placed within the public right-of-way. Signs and planting strips shall be arranged so that they do not obstruct visibility for drivers or pedestrians. 
                  Sec. 9.9. - Off-street loading requirements.
