PREFACE 
</p>

         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE                   This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Oxford, Georgia. 
                  Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1997 Code, as supplemented through April 5, 2009, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the City Council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1997 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
                  The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
                  Chapter and Section Numbering System 
                  The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
                  Page Numbering System 
                  The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

                   
                  Indexes 
                  The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves that stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
                  Looseleaf Supplements 
                  A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
                  Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
                  Acknowledgments 
                  This publication was under the direct supervision of Sandra S. Fox, Senior Code Attorney, and Paula Freeman, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
                  The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Bob Schwartz, City Manager, and Ms. Lauran Willis, City Clerk, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication.

                  Section 2. All ordinances of a general and permanent nature enacted on or before June 17, 2013, and not included in the Code or recognized and continued in force by reference therein, are repealed.

Each act of violation and each day upon which any such violation shall continue or occur shall constitute a separate offense. The penalty provided by this section, unless another penalty is expressly provided, shall apply to the amendment of any Code section, whether or not such penalty is reenacted in the amendatory ordinance. In addition to the penalty prescribed above, the City Council may pursue other remedies such as abatement of nuisances, injunctive relief and revocation of licenses or permits. 
                  Section 5. Additions or amendments to the Code when passed in such form as to indicate the intention of the City Council to make the same a part of the Code shall be deemed to be incorporated in the Code, so that reference to the Code includes the additions and amendments.

                  SUPPLEMENT HISTORY TABLE 
                  The table below allows users of this Code to quickly and accurately determine what ordinances have been considered for codification in each supplement. Ordinances that are of a general and permanent nature are codified in the Code Book and are considered "Includes." Ordinances that are not of a general and permanent nature are not codified in the Code Book and are considered "Omits." 
                  By adding to this table with each supplement, users of this Municipal Code will be able to gain a more complete picture of the Code's historical evolution.

                  F.  Changes in appropriations. Mayor and Council, by resolution, may make changes in the appropriations contained in the current operating budget at any regular meeting or any special or emergency meeting called for such purpose, but any additional appropriations may be made only from an existing unexpended surplus.

Mayor and Council shall have power to accept, with or without amendments, or reject the proposed program and proposed means of financing.

                  (2)  Mayor and Council shall adopt by resolution the final capital improvements budget for the ensuing fiscal year not later than the thirty-first day of December of each year.

                  (2)  Mayor and Council may quitclaim any rights it may have in property not needed for public purposes upon report by the Mayor and adoption of a resolution, both finding that the property is not needed for public or other purposes and that the interest of the City has no readily ascertainable monetary value. 
                  (3)  Whenever in opening, extending, or widening any street, avenue, alley, or public place of the City, a small parcel or tract of land is cut off or separated by such work from a larger tract or boundary of land owned by the City, Mayor and Council may authorize the Mayor to execute and deliver in the name of the City a deed conveying the cut-off or separated parcel or tract of land to an abutting or adjoining property owner or owners in exchange for rights-of-way of the street, avenue, alley, or public place when such exchange is deemed to be in the best interest of the City.

                  (9)  Ordinances, resolutions, regulations, contracts and inter-local agreements. Unless otherwise provided in this Code, all ordinances, resolutions, contracts, and inter-local agreements of the City shall be prepared, approved, introduced, and adopted in the following manner:

                  c.  Introduction and adoption. 
                  1.  Every proposed ordinance shall be introduced in writing and in the form required for final adoption. No ordinance shall contain a subject which is not expressed in its title. The enacting clause shall be "the council of the City hereby ordains…." and every ordinance shall so begin. 
                  2.  An ordinance may be introduced by any member of the City Council and be read at a regular or special meeting of the City Council.

                  4.  All ordinances shall have two separate readings. 
                  5.  No ordinance shall relate to more than one subject, which shall be clearly expressed in its title, and no ordinance, or section thereof, shall be amended or repealed unless the new ordinance contains the title of the ordinance or section amended or repealed, and when practicable all ordinances shall be introduced as amendments to this Code. 
                  6.  An ordinance, resolution, or contract shall be deemed, adopted, or rejected by the City Council in accordance with the rules which the City Council shall establish. Such ordinances adopted by the City Council shall have the full force and effect of law. 
                  d.  Effective date. Except where applicable in subsection (9)e of this section, no ordinance shall take effect until five days after the date of its publication, except a public emergency ordinance necessary for the protection of public health, public safety, public property, or the public peace, may be made effective upon adoption. 
                  e.  Emergencies. To meet a public emergency affecting life, health, property, or public peace, the City Council may convene on call of the Mayor or three members of the City Council and may promptly adopt an emergency ordinance, but such ordinance shall not levy taxes; grant, renew, or extend a franchise; regulate the rate charged by any public utility for its services; or authorize the borrowing of money except for loans to be repaid within 30 days. An emergency ordinance shall be introduced in the form prescribed for ordinances generally, except that it shall be plainly designated as an emergency ordinance and shall contain, after the enacting clause, a declaration stating that an emergency exists and describing the emergency in clear and specific terms. An emergency ordinance may be adopted, with or without amendment, or rejected at the meeting at which it is introduced, but the affirmative vote of at least three members of the City Council shall be required for adoption. It shall become effective upon adoption or at such later time as it may specify. Every emergency ordinance shall automatically stand repealed 30 days following the date upon which it was adopted, but this shall not prevent reenactment of the ordinance in the manner specified in this section if the emergency continues to exist. An emergency ordinance shall also be repealed by adoption of a repealing ordinance in the same manner specified in this Section for adoption of emergency ordinances. 
                  (10)  Recording vote. Whenever any member shall request it the yeas and nays of the members present shall be recorded on the minutes on any question taken. 
                  (11)  Questions of order. The presiding officer shall decide all questions of order, but any councilmember who is dissatisfied with the decision may appeal to the City Council in the manner provided by Robert's Rules of Order for appealing from decisions of presiding officers. 
                  (12)  Elections. All elections by the City Council shall be by ballot, and a majority vote of the whole City Council shall be necessary to an election.

                  (a)  The flood hazard areas of the City are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (b)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities.

                  Substantial improvement. 
                  (1)  The term substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the start of construction of the improvement. The market value of the structure should be the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or, in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. The term substantial improvement includes structures which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
                  (2)  For the purposes of this definition, the term substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  (3)  The term substantial improvement does not, however, include those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to ensure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the Code Enforcement Official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project, or any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions exist when the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this article, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article. 
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  State waters means any and all rivers, streams, creeks, branches, lakes, reservoirs, ponds, drainage systems, springs, wells and other bodies of surface or subsurface water, natural or artificial, lying within or forming a part of the boundaries of the state which are not entirely confined and retained completely upon the property of a single individual, partnership or corporation. 
                  Structural erosion and sedimentation control practices means practices for the stabilization of erodible or sediment-producing areas by utilizing the mechanical properties of matter for the purpose of either changing the surface of the land or storing, regulating or disposing of runoff to prevent excessive sediment loss. Examples of structural erosion and sediment control practices are riprap, sediment basins, dikes, level spreaders, waterways or outlets, diversions, grade stabilization structures, sediment traps and land grading, etc. Such practices can be found in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia, published by the state soil and water conservation commission. 
                  Surface mining shall have the meaning provided in O.C.G.A. § 12-4-72 of the Mineral Resources and Caves Act. 
                  Trout streams means all streams or portions of streams within the watershed as designated by the game and fish division of the state department of natural resources under the provisions of the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, O.C.G.A. § 12-5-20 et seq. Streams designated as primary trout waters are those supporting a self-sustaining population of rainbow, brown or brook trout. Streams designated as secondary trout waters are those in which there is no evidence of natural trout reproduction, but are capable of supporting trout throughout the year. First order trout waters are streams into which no other streams flow except springs. 
                  Vegetative erosion and sedimentation control measures means measures for the stabilization of erodible or sediment-producing areas by covering the soil with permanent seeding, sprigging or planting, producing long-term vegetative cover; or temporary seeding, producing short-term vegetative cover; or sodding, covering areas with a turf of perennial sod-forming grass. Such measures can be found in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia, published by the state soil and water conservation commission. 
                  Watercourse means any natural or artificial watercourse, stream, river, creek, channel, ditch, canal, conduit, culvert, drain, waterway, gully, ravine or wash in which water flows either continuously or intermittently and which has a definite channel, bed and banks, and including any area adjacent thereto subject to inundation by reason of overflow or floodwater. 
                  Wetlands means those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas.

                  Sec. 14-133. - Best management practices required. 
                  (a)  Best management practices as set forth in this section shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f) a part of the Georgia Water Quality Control Act. As used in this subsection, the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
                  (b)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the EPD pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), part of the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This subsection shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale, unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  (c)  Failure to properly design, install or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the EPD pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), part of the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (d)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
                  (e)  The local issuing authority may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in this section, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c).

                  The rules and regulations, ordinances or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq., for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities, shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" published by the state soil and water conservation commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regarding and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  (7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in runoff water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this subsection, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in this section; 
                  (15)  Except as provided in subsection (16) of this section, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the groundwater table year round; for which groundwater is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow, unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to the Metropolitan River Protection Act, O.C.G.A. § 12-5-440 et seq., shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this subsection. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
                  1.  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
                  2.  Stream crossings for sewer lines; 
                  (16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as trout streams pursuant to Georgia Water Quality Control Act, O.C.G.A. § 12-5-20 et seq., except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
                  1.  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
                  2.  Stream crossings for sewer lines.

                  (a)  Generally. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this chapter and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the City. However, the owner or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
                  (b)  Application requirements. 
                  (1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the City without first obtaining a permit from the Environmental Protection Division (EPD) to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
                  (2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to EPD and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. The plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in section 14-180. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of sections 14-133 and 14-134 will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by a sufficient number of copies as may be specified of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10 (Ga. Comp. Rules and Regs. 391-3-7-.10). 
                  (3)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit.

                  ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

                  Sec. 28-1. - Complete streets. 
                  Purpose. All new or renovated transportation infrastructure in the City should adhere to the concept of "complete streets." Complete streets achieve safety, comfort and convenience for all modes of travel, including pedestrians, bicycles, and automobiles. The following is a checklist of elements that should be incorporated into all new developments or transportation projects in the City: 
                  (1)  Offer a full range of travel modes. 
                  (2)  Provide sidewalks, either separated by a park strip or with the required width to provide pedestrian safety on all new roads. 
                  (3)  Include bicycle lanes on new major roadways and retrofit existing major roadways during reconstruction projects. 
                  (4)  Connect to other transportation networks or roadways. 
                  (5)  Provide safe pedestrian crossings at key intersections. 
                  (6)  Provide full accessibility to all people. 
                  (7)  Contribute to the pleasant and convenient pedestrian atmosphere of the City.

                  Sec. 28-2. - Traffic calming. 
                  Traffic calming devices are roadway design elements intended to slow or reduce motor vehicle traffic in order to enhance livability and improve safety for pedestrians and cyclists. Types of traffic calming devices include the following: 
                  (1)  Speed humps. Speed humps are raised sections of pavement, constructed along a street, which cause drivers to reduce their speed. 
                  (2)  Chicane. A chicane is a series of two or more staggered curb extensions on alternating sides of the roadway. 
                  (3)  Median. Medians are raised islands placed at the center of a roadway that separate two directions of traffic. 
                  (4)  Roundabouts. A roundabout is a type of circular junction in which road traffic must travel in one direction around a central island. Signs usually direct traffic entering the circle to slow down and yield to drivers already in the circle. 
                  (5)  Traffic circle. Traffic circles are raised islands, placed at intersections, around which traffic circulates. Traffic circles prevent drivers from speeding through intersections by impeding straight-through movement and forcing drivers to slow down to yield.

                  Sec. 28-3. - Basketball goals and courts. 
                  (a)  Basketball goals attached to the principal residential structure or erected adjacent to and abutting the driveway of the principal residential structure shall be allowed in the front yard but not within the right-of-way of a public street or sidewalk. No such basketball goal shall be erected in such a manner that the play area for the basketball goal is located within any portion of a public right-of-way. 
                  (b)  No goal, including portable goals, shall be placed in the public street or right-of-way, nor will a goal, including a portable goal, be placed so that the public street or sidewalk is the court or playing surface for the basketball goal. 
                  (c)  Any basketball goal or portable goal located within the public street or right-of-way is declared a nuisance. After giving notice of the violation to the owner of the basketball goal, the City shall have the authority to issue a citation and remove the nuisance basketball goal upon non-compliance within three days.

                  Sec. 28-25. - Access management standards. 
                  (a)  Location. Driveways shall be located where there are no sharp horizontal curves or steep vertical grades. Driveways shall meet state department of transportation standards for points of access. Driveways shall not be located on auxiliary, acceleration and deceleration lanes, or their tapers. 
                  (b)  Width. Ingress-egress openings, commonly referred to as "curb cuts", shall not be less than 24 feet nor more than 40 feet in width for two-lane entrances for nonresidential uses, unless approved by the City Council. 
                  (c)  Distance from intersections. Driveways shall be no closer than 25 feet measured from the right-of-way of intersecting collector streets to the center line of the drive, and no closer than 50 feet measured from the right-of-way of an intersection involving a major or minor arterial to the center line of the drive. 
                  (d)  Offset. Either the centerline of opposing streets shall align, or shall be offset a minimum of 25 feet. This condition shall not apply where a permanent median exists without a break for these streets. 
                  (e)  Curb radius. To ensure safe turn movements, turning radii for commercial drive curb cuts should be at least 20 feet for curb cuts along arterial and collector streets. 
                  (f)  Entrance, exit and parking design. All parking facilities, except those serving single-family detached dwellings, shall be designed so that all existing movements onto a public street are in a forward motion. 
                  (g)  Right turn only. Site plans for all commercial and institutional uses on minor arterial and major arterial streets will be required to have exit points that are designated right turn only exiting movements onto a public street. 
                  (h)  Sight distance. No fence, wall, sign, hedge or planting or similar improvement will be permitted to obstruct the sight lines or visibility of motorists or pedestrians at any intersection of public or private streets or at any driveway intersection with a public or private street. For purposes of this section, obstructions shall be defined in terms of height as elevations between 30 inches and 12 feet above any roadway or driveway, as applicable. 
                  (i)  Area regulated; measurement. Unless otherwise specified by the Zoning Administrator, the area regulated shall be two triangular areas formed by the street right-of-way lines, or such lines extended, and lines connecting such right-of-way lines at points 25 feet from the intersections of the right-of-way lines. In such cases as right-of-way lines do not exist or cannot be determined, the measurements shall be made from points 15 feet from the centerline of the existing road or ten feet from the existing pavement or roadbed, whichever is greater. 
                  (j)  ADA requirements. Sidewalks and curb ramps shall meet Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 USC 12010 et seq., requirements at all intersections and driveway entrances. New public and private driveways shall be brought in compliance with applicable Americans with Disabilities Act standards. 
                  (k)  Acceleration and deceleration lanes. Acceleration and deceleration lanes shall be designed in accordance with state department of transportation standards. Acceleration and deceleration lanes shall not be required within the confines of an historic district. 
                  (l)  Joint and cross access. 
                  (1)  Major traffic generators. Adjacent commercial or office properties classified as major traffic generators (i.e. shopping plazas, office parks), shall provide a cross access drive and pedestrian access to allow circulation between sites. 
                  (2)  Techniques. A system of joint use driveways and cross access easements shall be established in the town center district and the building site shall incorporate a continuous service drive or cross access corridor extending the entire length of each property served to provide for driveway separation consistent with the curbcut standards. Stub-outs and other design features to make it visually obvious that the abutting properties may be tied in to provide cross-access via a service drive. 
                  (m)  Speed. Within parking lots, a design speed of ten miles per hour and sufficient width to accommodate two-way travel aisles designed to accommodate automobiles, service vehicles, and loading vehicles. 
                  (n)  Unified access and circulation system plan. A unified access and circulation system plan that includes coordinated or shared parking areas in the town center district is encouraged wherever feasible. 
                  (o)  Shared parking. Shared parking areas shall be permitted to reduce required parking if peak demand periods for proposed land uses do not occur at the same time periods (e.g. bank and movie theater). 
                  (p)  Documentation. Pursuant to this section, property owners shall: 
                  (1)  Access easement. Record an easement with the Newton County Probate Court allowing cross access to and from other properties served by the joint use driveways and cross access or service drive. 
                  (2)  Access agreement. Record an agreement with the deed that remaining access rights along the thoroughfare will be dedicated to the City and pre-existing driveways will be closed and eliminated after construction of the joint-use driveway. 
                  (3)  Maintenance agreement. Record a joint maintenance agreement with the deed defining maintenance responsibilities of property owners. 
                  (q)  Reduction in separation distance. The Planning Commission may reduce required separation distance of access points where they prove impractical, provided that joint access driveways and cross access easements are provided wherever feasible in accordance with this section, the site plan incorporates a unified access and circulation system in accordance with this section, and the property owner shall enter a written agreement with the City to be recorded with the deed that pre-existing connections on the site will be closed and eliminated after construction of each side of the joint use driveway.

                  DIVISION 2. - PROCEDURE 

                  Sec. 30-47. - General platting procedures. 
                  The procedure for the formal review and approval of a subdivision plat consists of one recommended stage and three required stages. These are the pre-application review stages recommended, preliminary plat stage (required), final plat stage (required), and recording and dedication (required), respectively. 
                  (1)  Pre-preliminary plat stage. Whenever the subdivision of a tract of land is proposed, the subdivider is urged to consult early and informally with the Planning Commission. The subdivider may submit sketch plans and data showing existing conditions within the site and in its vicinity, and the proposed development layout of the subdivision. The purpose of the pre-preliminary plat stage is to facilitate the subsequent preparation of plans and plats by clarifying matters relating to the proposed subdivision, and this chapter. 
                  (2)  Preliminary plat stage. Prior to making any street improvements or installing any utilities or selling any lots, the developer shall submit to the Planning Commission, for review and recommendation to the Mayor and City Council, a preliminary plat of the proposed subdivision prepared in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. The developer also shall furnish copies of such preliminary plat to all utility companies serving the area. Approval of the Mayor and City Council shall be indicated on the face of the preliminary plat. 
                  (3)  Final plat stage. After completion of the required improvements, or proper arrangements for same, of all or part of the area shown on the preliminary plat as approved by the Mayor and City Council and before selling any lots or constructing any structure thereon, a final plat, together with the required certificates, shall be submitted to the Planning Commission for review and recommendation to the Mayor and City Council. The developer also shall furnish copies of such final plat to all utility companies serving the area. 
                  (4)  Recording and dedication stage. After the final plat is approved and duly signed by the Mayor and City Council, the final plat and appropriate documents become the instrument to be recorded in the office of the clerk of the Superior Court of Newton County, Georgia. After recording, the appropriate deeds and documents shall be presented to the City Clerk for dedication and acceptance by the City in accordance with section 30-52. 
                  (5)  Exception of minor subdivisions. Subdivisions which do not involve the platting, construction, or opening of new streets, sewers, or water facilities, or improvement to existing streets shall be defined as minor subdivisions, and as such, are subject to only the requirements of the final plat stage and the recording and dedication stage. Subdivisions so defined shall be submitted to the Planning Commission for review and recommendation to the Mayor and City Council in the form of a final plat and the final plat shall comply in all respects to this chapter. 
                  (Code 1997, § 41-401) 
                  Sec. 30-48. - Preliminary plat procedures. 
                  (a)  Preliminary plat submission. At least 15 days prior to the Planning Commission's first regularly scheduled monthly meeting at which the subdivider desires Planning Commission action, the subdivider shall submit to the City Clerk: 
                  (1)  A letter requesting review and approval of a preliminary plat and giving the name and address of a person to whom the notice of hearing and approval or disapproval by the Mayor and City Council on the preliminary plat shall be sent; and 
                  (2)  Three copies of the preliminary plat and supporting data. At such time, the Planning Commission may direct the subdivider to furnish additional copies to the review agencies having appropriate technical expertise or proper authority, for consideration and comment. 
                  (b)  Official date of submission. The official date of submission of the plat shall be the date of the next regularly scheduled monthly meeting of the Planning Commission after timely submission of the preliminary plat to the City Clerk. 
                  (c)  Preliminary plat review. The Planning Commission shall review the preliminary plat for conformance to this chapter, the city zoning ordinance and other relevant regulations and shall consider the comments or suggestions of the appropriate review agencies requested to review the preliminary plat. The Planning Commission shall indicate on the plat, or by a written memorandum attached thereto, any comments and suggested changes that are necessary to meet the intent of this chapter or to serve the best interests of the City. 
                  (d)  Hearing. No plat shall be acted upon by the Planning Commission without affording the subdivider a hearing thereon. The hearing will be held at the next regularly scheduled monthly meeting of the Planning Commission after submission of the preliminary plat to the City Clerk, notice of the time and place of which shall be sent by first class mail not less than five days before the date fixed therefor. 
                  (e)  Recommendation to the Mayor and City Council. Not more than 45 days after the hearing on the preliminary plat, the Planning Commission shall make a recommendation for approval or disapproval to the Mayor and City Council. 
                  (f)  Action on the preliminary plat. Not more than 30 days after receipt of the recommendation from the Planning Commission, the Mayor and City Council may take any one of the following actions: 
                  (1)  Issue a certificate approving the plat; 
                  (2)  Issue a certificate conditionally approving the plat with the conditions of approval noted on the plat or attached thereto; or 
                  (3)  Disapprove the plat or any portion thereof, in which case the City Clerk shall notify the subdivider in writing, stating the reasons therefor. 
                  Action of the Mayor and City Council shall be noted on two copies of the preliminary plat and on the original if approved. The original shall be returned to the applicant and one copy retained by the City Clerk. The other copy will be retained and made a part of the City's records. In the case of conditional approval, once the subdivider has satisfactorily completed or complied with the conditions indicated, the Mayor and City Council shall issue a certificate of approval of the preliminary plat. 
                  (g)  Approval of preliminary plat. Approval of a preliminary plat is only tentative, pending submission of the final plat, and shall be effective and binding upon the City for a period not to exceed two years and thereafter expire and be null and void except to the extent that work on the subdivision has progressed, unless a request for an extension of time has been submitted to the Planning Commission and is subsequently approved by the Mayor and City Council. 
                  (h)  Improvements authorized. Approval of the preliminary plat is authorization to proceed with installation of any required improvements, subject to the approval of agencies having the proper authority, and the preparation of the final plat, or unit division or phase thereof as provided in section 30-49(1)d.

                  Sec. 30-80. - Access. 
                  Access to every subdivision shall be provided over a public street and every lot within a subdivision shall be served by a publicly dedicated street, or a private street meeting the standards of a public street and approved. 
                  (Code 1997, § 41-503) 
                  Sec. 30-81. - Conformance to city land use plan. 
                  Proposed subdivisions shall conform to the adopted city land use plan and development policies in effect at the time of submission to the Planning Commission. When features of the adopted city land use plan, such as schools or other public building sites, parks, major streets, or other land for public uses, are located in whole or in part in a proposed subdivision, such features shall be either dedicated or reserved by the subdivider for acquisition within a reasonable time by the appropriate public agency. 
                  (Code 1997, § 41-504) 
                  Sec. 30-82. - Reservation or dedication of public use areas. 
                  (a)  Reservation of plan features. Where the features of the comprehensive plan, such as school sites, parks, playgrounds, and other public spaces are located in whole or in part in a proposed subdivision, such features shall be reserved by the subdivider; provided, however, that no more than ten percent of the total area of the subdivision shall be required for reservation to fulfill the requirements of this section. Whenever the land required for such plan features is not purchased, acquired, optioned or condemned by the appropriate public agency within a two year period from the date of recording the subdivision or by the time that at least 75 percent of the lots are built on and occupied, whichever is sooner, the subdivider may claim the original reservation and cause it to be subdivided in a manner suitable to the subdivider, subject to the provisions of this chapter. Whenever a public body responsible for land acquisition executes a written release, stating that the reserved land is not to be acquired, the Mayor and City Council shall waive the reservation requirements. 
                  (b)  Reservation omissions. The Mayor and City Council shall not approve any plats of subdivision when such planned features, as specified by the city land use plan, are not incorporated into the plat, and the reservation requirements for such features have not been waived. 
                  (c)  Unnecessary or unsuitable reservations. Whenever the Mayor and City Council finds that proposed reservation of land or dedication of land for public use is not required or suitable for such public use, it may require the rearrangement of lots to include such land. 
                  (Code 1997, § 41-505) 
                  Sec. 30-83. - Conformity to city regulations. 
                  In all subdivisions, due regard shall be shown for all natural features, such as large trees, and watercourses, and for historical spots and similar community assets which, if preserved, will add attractiveness and value to the property and the city's regulations regarding tree protection and maintenance, soil erosion and wetlands protection shall be applicable.

                  DIVISION 2. - STANDARDS AND SPECIFICATIONS 

                  Sec. 30-114. - Streets. 
                  All streets which shall hereafter be established in connection with the development of a subdivision shall comply with the following design standards: 
                  (1)  Continuation of existing streets. Wherever topography will permit, the arrangement of streets in a subdivision shall provide for the alignment and continuation or projection of existing streets into adjoining areas. Existing streets shall be continued at the same or greater width, but in no case less than the required width. 
                  (2)  Street names . Streets or roads that are extensions of, or obviously in alignment with, existing named streets, shall bear the name. The names of new streets and roads shall be subject to the approval of the Mayor and City Council and shall not duplicate or be similar in sound to existing names, irrespective of the use of the suffix street, avenue, circle, way, boulevard, drive, place or court. 
                  (3)  Development along major highway or railroad right-of-way. Where a subdivision abuts or contains a major arterial highway, a limited access highway, or a railroad right-of-way, the Mayor and City Council may require a street approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way, either as a marginal access or at a suitable distance for an appropriate use of the intervening land, with double fronting lots, reverse frontage, and a non-access reservation suitably planted, if applicable. In such cases, due regard should be given to requirements for approach grades and future grade separations in determining distances, and lots should have access only from the access street. 
                  (4)  Intersections . The centerlines of no more than two streets shall intersect at any one point. Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles, and no street shall intersect any other street at an angle of less than 60 degrees. The angle of intersection is to be measured at the intersection of the street centerlines. 
                  (5)  Street jogs. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 125 feet shall not be permitted. 
                  (6)  Cul-de-sacs or dead-end streets. Local streets or courts designed to have one end permanently closed shall be provided with a turnaround at the closed end, having a minimum right-of-way of at least 120 feet in diameter and pavement with a minimum outside diameter of 100 feet. 
                  (7)  Half streets. Half streets are prohibited. Whenever a street is planned adjacent to the proposed subdivision tract boundary, the entire street right-of-way shall be platted within the proposed subdivision. 
                  (8)  Alleys. Alleys or service drives may be required at the rear of all lots used for multifamily or commercial developments, but shall not be provided in one and two family residential developments unless the alley or service drive is to provide secondary access to a lots whose natural grade is more than six feet above the finished street grade, or unless the subdivider produces evidence satisfactory to the Mayor and City Council of the need for an alley or service drive. 
                  (9)  Minor streets. Minor streets are streets which are constructed so as to provide secondary access only. No more than six lots may abut any such street, and no such street may exceed 1,000 feet in length. Such streets may not be used as through streets and should be permitted only when lots abut an arterial or collector street. 
                  (10)  Street rights-of-way and pavement widths. 
                  a.  The right-of-way shall be the perpendicular distance across a street from property line to property line. In commercial subdivisions, specifications for street and right-of-way width, thickness of base and approved street materials shall be set by the Mayor and City Council or their designee, and shall be in accordance with state department of transportation requirements for load limits and traffic volume. Minimum street rights-of-way and pavement widths shall be as follows: 
                  b.  Street rights-of-way and pavement widths are described in the following chart: 

                   
                  *As shown or represented in the City major thoroughfare plan or on the official map. 
                  **Pavement width is measured from the back of the curb to the back of the curb. 
                  (11)  Additional right-of-way on proposed streets. The right-of-way width in the above table is minimum, and in areas of cut or fill the right-of-way must be increased two feet for each one foot of material removed for the cut or added for the fill. This additional right-of-way must be added to the side or sides where the cut or fill takes place. The minimum allowable degree of slope on a back slope shall be one and five tenths to one and on a fill slope the degree of slope shall be two to one. 
                  (12)  Additional width on existing streets. In subdivisions that adjoin existing streets, the subdivider shall dedicate additional right-of-way to meet the above minimum street width requirements as follows: 
                  a.  The entire right-of-way shall be provided where any part of the subdivision is on both sides of the street. 
                  b.  When the subdivision is located on one side of an existing street, one-half of the required right-of-way measured from the centerline of the existing roadway, shall be provided. 
                  (13)  Reserve strips. Reserve strips or non-access reservations which control access to streets, alleys, and public grounds should be avoided, but if permitted shall be at least five feet wide and shall be dedicated to the City. 
                  (14)  Street grades. All street grades shall conform to the state department of transportation geometric design standards for each class of road as follows: 
                  a.  Major thoroughfares, to conform to Class IV roads. 
                  b.  Collector streets, to conform to Class V roads. 
                  c.  All other streets, to conform to Class VI roads. 
                  (15)  Horizontal curvature. The minimum radii of centerline curvature shall conform to the state department of transportation's geometric design standards for each class of roads as follows: 
                  a.  Major thoroughfares to conform to Class IV roads. 
                  b.  Collector streets to conform to Class V roads. 
                  c.  All other streets to conform to Class VI roads. 
                  (16)  Tangents. The tangents between reverse curves shall conform to the state department of transportation's geometric design standards for each class of road as follows: 
                  a.  Major thoroughfares to conform to Class IV roads. 
                  b.  Collector streets to conform to Class V roads. 
                  c.  All other streets to conform to Class VI roads. 
                  (17)  Vertical alignment. Vertical alignment, stopping sight distance, measured between points 4½ feet above the centerline of the street, shall conform to the state department of transportation's geometric design standards for each class of road as follows: 
                  a.  Major thoroughfares to conform to Class IV roads. 
                  b.  Collector streets to conform to Class V roads. 
                  c.  All other streets to conform to Class VI roads. 
                  (18)  Curb-line radii. Property lines at street intersections shall be rounded with a curb radius of 20 feet; where the angle of intersection is less than 90 degrees, the Planning Commission may require a greater radius. The Planning Commission also may permit comparable cut-offs or chords in place of rounded comers. 
                  (19)  Right-of-way radius . The right-of-way radius at street intersections shall parallel the curb line radius. 
                  (20)  Steep slope development. Street design and construction in areas of steep slopes in the City are subject to variance from the uniform standards established in this chapter if deemed necessary by the Planning Commission and the Mayor and City Council to carry out the intent and purpose of this chapter. If such variance is required, the Mayor and City Council or its designee shall establish appropriate design and construction standards on an individual subdivision basis.

                  Sec. 30-115. - Lots. 
                  All lots which shall hereafter be established in connection with the development of a subdivision shall comply with the following design standards in addition to the appropriate provisions of the city zoning ordinance: 
                  (1)  Lot lines. Insofar as practical, side lot lines shall be perpendicular or radial to street lines. 
                  (2)  Jurisdictional limits of lot lines. Lots shall not be divided by city or county boundary lines. 
                  (3)  Lot frontage arrangements. The subdividing of the land shall be such as to provide each lot with direct abutting access to an existing public street or to an approved street contained within the proposed subdivision. Each lot must front for at least 40 feet upon an approved street or road. 
                  (4)  Adequate building sites. Each lot shall contain an adequate building site not subject to flooding and outside the limits of any existing easements or building setback lines required by this chapter and any existing ordinance as is appropriate. 
                  (5)  Double or reverse frontage lots . Double and reverse frontage, unless required by the Mayor and City Council, shall be prohibited except where essential to provide separation of residential development from traffic arteries or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography, orientation, and property size. A planting screen reservation of at least five feet in width, and across which there shall be no right of access, may be required along the line of lots abutting such a traffic artery or other disadvantageous use. 
                  (6)  Commercial lots. Size, shape, and arrangements of commercial lots, where platted and classified as a subdivision, as herein defined, shall be subject to review of the Planning Commission and the approval of the Mayor and City Council. Where public water or sewer is not available, minimum lot size and minimum coverage shall be based on lot area needed for proper sewerage disposal or water supply. In no case shall the building setback on all streets be closer than 15 feet from the front property line of the lot, and within such space no permanent surface structures or facilities shall be constructed. 
                  (7)  Lot remnants. Lot remnants shall be prohibited. Such remnant areas shall be added to adjacent lots, rather than remain as unusable parcels. 
                  (8)  Easements. Easements shall be required in subdivisions for the following purposes: 
                  a.  Utility easements. When it is found to be necessary and desirable to locate public utility lines in other than street right-of-ways, easements shall be shown on the plat for such purposes. Such easements shall not be less than 12 feet in width and where possible, shall be centered on rear or side lot lines. 
                  b.  Watercourse and drainage easements. Where a proposed subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainage way, or stream, appropriate provisions shall be made to accommodate stormwater and drainage through and from the proposed subdivision. Such easement shall conform substantially with the lines of the watercourse and be of sufficient width or construction, or both, as to be adequate for the purpose.

                  DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

                  Sec. 30-144. - Performance and specifications. 
                  A well designed subdivision means little to a prospective lot buyer until he can see actual physical transformation of raw land into lots with all necessary improvements provided. Likewise, a well designed subdivision is not an asset to the community until the necessary improvements have been installed. Every subdivider shall be required to make the improvements outlined in this article in accordance with the specifications herein or otherwise adopted by the Mayor and City Council.

                  Sec. 30-145. - Grading. 
                  All streets, roads, and alleys shall be graded by the subdividers in such a manner that pavements and other improvements (sidewalks and curb and gutter, if provided or required) can be constructed to the required cross section. The minimum width of grading shall be the pavement width, as specified in section 30-114(10), plus six feet on each side measured from the back of curb or pavement edge. Deviation from the above will be allowed only when due to special topographical conditions. 
                  (1)  Preparation. Before grading is started the entire right-of-way area shall be first cleared of all stumps, roots, brush, and other objectionable materials and all trees not intended for preservation. 
                  (2)  Cuts. All tree stumps, boulders, and other obstructions shall be removed to a depth of two feet below the subgrade. 
                  (3)  Rock. When encountered, rock shall be scarified to a depth of 12 inches below the subgrade. 
                  (4)  Fill. All suitable material from roadway cuts may be used in the construction of fills, approaches, or at other places as needed. Excess materials, including organic materials, soft clay, etc., shall be removed from the roadway. The fill shall be spread in layers not to exceed 12 inches loose and compacted. The filling of utility trenches and other places not accessible to the roller shall be mechanically tamped. 
                  (5)  Subgrade. The subgrade shall be properly shaped, rolled and uniformly compacted to conform with the lines, grades, and typical cross sections as shown on drawings if required, and approved by the Mayor and City Council after review by the designated review agency. Unsuitable material shall be excavated and replaced with acceptable compacted material.

                  Sec. 30-146. - Storm drainage. 
                  An adequate drainage system, including necessary open ditches, pipes, culverts, intersectional drains, drop inlets, bridges, etc., shall be provided for the proper drainage of all surface water according to curb and gutter plans and specifications as required, and approved by the Mayor and City Council after review by the designated review agency. Cross-drains shall be provided to accommodate all natural waterflow, and shall be of sufficient length to permit full width roadway and the required slopes.

                  ARTICLE V. - CONSERVATION SUBDIVISIONS 

                  Sec. 30-203. - Purpose and intent. 
                  (a)  It is the purpose of this article to ensure conservation of open space within a new residential development. A conservation subdivision design preserves open space while maintaining the prorated density of residential units over the entire development. The overall density of each development is maintained by allowing smaller residential lots in neighborhoods that preserve aesthetically and ecologically important areas. The design process identifies and sets aside conservation areas prior to the delineation of transportation and residential layouts. Open space areas include wetlands, stream buffer zones, woodlands, farmlands, playing fields, and meadows, depending on the resources of the land. 
                  (b)  The purposes of conservation subdivisions are as follows: 
                  (1)  Preserve important areas of land for ecological, recreational, and agricultural purposes in perpetuity. 
                  (2)  Preserve and protect exceptional terrain, scenic views, or sites of historic interest. 
                  (3)  Protect water resources such as streams, wetlands, and aquifers. 
                  (4)  Prevent flooding, erosion, and water pollution. 
                  (5)  Preserve wildlife habitat and indigenous vegetation. 
                  (6)  Promote interconnected greenways and corridors. 
                  (7)  Promote contiguous open space with adjacent jurisdictions. 
                  (8)  Encourage interaction in the community by clustering houses and orienting them closer to the street, providing public gathering places and encouraging use of parks and community facilities as focal points in the neighborhood. 
                  (9)  Encourage street design that reduces traffic speed and reliance on arterial roads. 
                  (10)  Promote construction of multi-use trails both within the subdivision and connected to neighboring communities, businesses, and facilities. 
                  (Code 1997, § 19-101; Ord. of 12-5-2011(04), § 1) 
                  Sec. 30-204. - General regulations. 
                  (a)  Applicability of regulations. The conservation subdivision designation is available by right in the following zoning districts: Rural Residential (RR), single-family residential-low density district (R-30), single-family residential-low to medium density district (R-20), and single-family residential-medium density district (R-15). An applicant shall comply with all other provisions of the zoning code and all other applicable laws. 
                  (b)  Ownership of development site. The tract of land to be subdivided may be held in single or multiple ownership. If held in multiple ownership, however, the site shall be developed according to a single plan with common authority and common responsibility. 
                  (c)  Housing density determination. The maximum number of lots in the conservation subdivision shall be determined by either of the following two methods, at the discretion of the applicant: 
                  (1)  Calculation. The maximum number of lots is determined by dividing the area of the tract of land by the minimum lot size specified in the underlying zoning. In making this calculation, the following shall not be included in the total area of the parcel: 
                  a.  Slopes over 25 percent of at least 5,000 square feet contiguous area; 
                  b.  The 100-year floodplain; 
                  c.  Bodies of open water over 20,000 square feet contiguous area; and 
                  d.  Wetlands that meet the definition of the Army Corps of Engineers pursuant to the Clean Water Act. 
                  (2)  Yield plan. The maximum number of lots is based on a conventional subdivision design plan, prepared by the applicant, in which the tract of land is subdivided in a manner intended to yield the highest number of lots possible.

                  Sec. 36-197. - Findings of fact. 
                  The Mayor and City Council find that discharges into the City's separate storm sewer that are not composed entirely of stormwater runoff contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters. Nonstormwater discharges occur due to spills, dumping and improper connections to the City's separate storm sewer system from residential, industrial, commercial and institutional establishments. Impacts of such discharges adversely effect public health and safety, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of land and water, and can be minimized through the regulation of spills, dumping and discharges into the City's storm sewer system and proper management of post-development stormwater runoff.

                  The following performance criteria shall be applicable to all stormwater management plans, unless otherwise provided for in this division: 
                  (1)  Water quality. All stormwater runoff generated from a site shall be adequately treated before discharge. It will be presumed that a stormwater management system complies with this requirement if: 
                  a.  It is sized to treat the prescribed water quality treatment volume from the site, as defined in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual; 
                  b.  Appropriate structural stormwater or nonstructural practices are selected, designed, constructed or preserved, and maintained according to the specific criteria in the GSMM; and 
                  c.  Runoff from hotspot land uses and activities identified by the City are adequately treated and addressed through the use of appropriate structural stormwater controls, nonstructural practices and pollution prevention practices. 
                  (2)  Stream channel protection. Protection of stream channels from bank and bed erosion and degradation shall be provided by using all of the following three approaches: 
                  a.  Preservation, restoration or reforestation (with native vegetation) of the applicable stream buffer; 
                  b.  24 hour extended detention storage of the one-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event. This requirement may be adjusted or waived by the City for sites that discharge directly into larger streams, rivers, wetlands, or lakes, or to a manmade channel or conveyance system where the reduction in these flows will not have an impact on upstream or downstream streambank or channel integrity; and 
                  c.  Erosion prevention measures such as energy dissipation and velocity control. 
                  (3)  Overbank flooding protection. 
                  a.  Downstream overbank flood and property protection shall be provided by controlling (attenuating) the post-development peak discharge rate to the pre-development rate for the 25-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event. If control of the one-year, 24-hour storm under subsection (2)b of this section is exempted, then peak discharge rate attenuation of the two-year through the 25-year return frequency storm event must be provided. 
                  b.  This requirement may be adjusted or waived by the City for sites where the post-development downstream analysis shows that uncontrolled post-development conditions will not increase downstream peak flows, or that meeting the requirement will cause greater peak flow downstream impacts than the uncontrolled post-development conditions. 
                  (4)  Extreme flooding protection. 
                  a.  Extreme flood and public safety protection shall be provided by controlling and safely conveying the 100-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event such that flooding is not exacerbated. 
                  b.  This requirement may be adjusted or waived by the City for sites where the post-development downstream analysis shows that uncontrolled post-development conditions will not increase downstream peak flows or that meeting the requirement will cause greater peak flow downstream impacts than the uncontrolled post-development conditions. 
                  (5)  Structural stormwater controls. All structural stormwater management facilities shall be selected and designed using the appropriate criteria from the GSMM. All structural stormwater controls must be designed appropriately to meet their intended function. For other structural stormwater controls not included in the GSMM, or for which pollutant removal rates have not been provided, the effectiveness and pollutant removal of the structural control must be documented through prior studies, literature reviews, or other means and receive approval from the City before being included in the design of a stormwater management system. In addition, if hydrologic or topographic conditions, or land use activities warrant greater control than that provided by the GSMM control requirements, the City may impose additional requirements deemed necessary to protect upstream and downstream properties and aquatic resources from damage due to increased volume, frequency, and rate of stormwater runoff or increased nonpoint source pollution loads created on the site in question. Applicants shall consult the GSMM for guidance on the factors that determine site design feasibility when selecting and locating a structural stormwater control. 
                  (6)  Stormwater credits for nonstructural measures. The use of one or more site design measures by the applicant may allow for a reduction in the water quality treatment volume required under GSMM. The applicant may, if approved by the City, take credit for the use of stormwater better site design practices and reduce the water quality volume requirement. For each potential credit, GSMM provides a minimum set of criteria and requirements which identify the conditions or circumstances under which the credit may be applied. The site design practices that qualify for this credit and the criteria and procedures for applying and calculating the credits are included in the GSMM. 
                  (7)  Drainage system guidelines. Stormwater conveyance facilities, which may include but are not limited to culverts, stormwater drainage pipes, catch basins, drop inlets, junction boxes, headwalls, gutter, swales, channels, ditches, and energy dissipaters shall be provided when necessary for the protection of public right-of-way and private properties adjoining project sites or public right-of-ways. Stormwater conveyance facilities that are designed to carry runoff from more that one parcel, existing or proposed, shall meet the following requirements: 
                  a.  Methods to calculate stormwater flows shall be in accordance with the GSMM; 
                  b.  All culverts, pipe systems and open channel flow systems shall be sized in accordance with the stormwater management plan using the methods included in the GSMM; and 
                  c.  Design and construction of stormwater conveyance facilities shall be in accordance with the criteria and specifications found in the GSMM.

                  (2)  All inspections shall be documented with written reports that contain the following information: 
                  a.  The date and location of the inspection; 
                  b.  Whether construction is in compliance with the approved stormwater management plan; 
                  c.  Variations from the approved construction specifications; and 
                  d.  Any other variations or violations of the conditions of the approved stormwater management plan. 
                  (3)  If any violations are found, the applicant shall be notified in writing of the nature of the violation and the required corrective actions. 
                  (b)  Final inspection and as built plans. Upon completion of a project, and before a certificate of occupancy shall be granted, the applicant shall be responsible for certifying that the completed project is in accordance with the approved stormwater management plan. All applicants are required to submit actual as built plans for any stormwater management facilities or practices after final construction is completed. The plan must show the final design specifications for ail stormwater management facilities and practices and must be certified by a state licensed professional engineer. The plans shall be submitted in hard copy and digital CAD or GIS format.

                  (a)  The boundaries of zoning districts and overlay districts created by this chapter are hereby established as shown on the official zoning map of the City. 
                  (b)  The official zoning map and all explanatory matter thereon accompany and are hereby made a part of this chapter. The official zoning map shall indicate the date of adoption and most recent amendment. The original of the official zoning map shall be kept in the office of the City Clerk. 
                  (c)  The official zoning map shall be considered the same as the official comprehensive zoning map as referenced in the City Charter. 
                  (d)  The official zoning map may be kept electronically in a geographic information system and such electronic data shall constitute an integral part of the official zoning map. 
                  (e)  The City may make copies of the official zoning maps available to the public for a reasonable fee.

                  Sec. 40-28. - Amendment of official zoning map. 
                  If, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, the City Council approves changes in the district boundaries or other subject matter portrayed on the official zoning map, such changes shall be made promptly after the amendment or change has been approved by the City Council.

                  Sec. 40-29. - Correction and update of property lines on official zoning map. 
                  (a)  The Zoning Administrator is authorized to correct or update property lines depicted on the official zoning map, as such changes to the tax records of the City are made through land subdivision and combination of lots, without a requirement to seek approval of the City Council, provided that such changes to property lines do not affect a zoning or overlay district boundary except as otherwise specifically provided in this section. 
                  (b)  In any instance where the property lines as shown on the official zoning map deviate from a boundary survey prepared by a registered land surveyor for the lot or tract in question, and such deviation is attributed by the Zoning Administrator to a drafting error or imperfection in the property parcel data base originally used in preparing the official zoning map, the Zoning Administrator is authorized to correct the official zoning map to show the boundaries of the zoning or overlay district to follow the boundaries as shown on the boundary survey. Any such correction shall be considered an administrative action, and additional approval or action by council shall not be necessary to correct the official zoning map.

                  This section shall govern administrative determinations by the Zoning Administrator in cases where there is uncertainty with regard to the zoning or overlay district boundaries shown on the official zoning map. Where such uncertainty exists, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  (1)  City limit lines. Where boundaries are indicated as approximately following the corporate limit line of the City, such corporate limit line shall be construed to be such boundaries. 
                  (2)  Property lines. Where boundaries are indicated as following property lines, such property lines shall be construed to be such boundaries. The boundaries shall be determined on the basis of the legal descriptions or boundary surveys associated with approved map amendments, where available. 
                  (3)  Stream and river beds. Where boundaries are indicated as approximately following the centerline of stream beds or river beds, or the outer edge of such stream bed or river bed, such centerline or edge of stream or river bed shall be construed to be such boundaries. 
                  (4)  Abandonment. Where a public street or other right-of-way is officially vacated or abandoned, and the street or right-of-way is also a zoning district or overlay district boundary, the regulations applicable to the property to which it reverted shall apply to such vacated or abandoned public street or right-of-way. 
                  (5)  Administrative determination. In any case where the exact location of a boundary cannot be determined by the foregoing methods, the Zoning Administrator shall determine the location of the boundary. Any such administrative determination is subject to appeal as an administrative decision in accordance with article IX of this chapter.

Buffer requirements established by this chapter, where applicable, supersede these minimum required yards. In the case where a build-to line is established, the build-to line provisions of this chapter supersede and replace any front building setback lines, the latter of which shall only be deemed applicable in the absence of an established build-to line. 
                  (b)  No lot shall be reduced in size, and no principal building shall hereafter be constructed, so that the front, side, or rear yards of the zoning district in which the lot and building are located are not maintained.

                  DIVISION 3. - AGRICULTURAL DISTRICT (AG) 

                  Sec. 40-105. - Purpose and intent. 
                  (a)  AG zoning districts are intended to implement the rural character areas established on the future development map of the city comprehensive plan, community agenda and as described in the community agenda. The prevailing land use pattern in this zoning district is agriculture, forestry, and very low density residential uses mostly incidental to farm operations as the principal use. The maximum density established for this district (one unit per three acres) is the most that can be permitted while still maintaining desired character. 
                  (b)  Sanitary sewer service is generally not available to land in this zoning district, and public water may or may not be available. Conventional suburban subdivisions even at low densities are considered incompatible with desired agricultural and rural residential character.

                  (a)  RR zoning districts are intended to implement the estate/rural residential and rural character areas established on the future development map of the city comprehensive plan, as provided in the community agenda. Sanitary sewer service is generally not available to land in this zoning district, and public water may or may not be available. The RR zoning district establishes a minimum lot size of 60,000 square feet (one unit per 1.38 acres) and a minimum lot width of 150 feet. A minimum house size (heated floor area per dwelling unit) of 2,000 square feet is established for new construction (not applicable to reconstruction if a natural disaster or fire occurs). 
                  (b)  The overall intent of this zoning district is to preserve rural and estate residential character, and provide for very low-density rural residential uses. Areas designated as RR zoning are inappropriate for urban development. Future development in this district must observe policies and guidelines for preserving rural character.

                  Sec. 40-250. - Purpose and intent. 
                  (a)  The R-7.5 zoning district establishes a minimum lot size of 7,500 square feet (0.172 acre). The minimum lot width established for this district is 50 feet. A minimum house size (heated floor area per dwelling unit) of 1,200 square feet is established for new construction; however, the average (mean) house size for the district must be equal to or greater than 2,000 square feet. Public water service and sanitary sewer are available and required for new lots platted in this zoning district. 
                  (b)  Generally, R-7.5 districts are within a five-minute walking distance (approximately one quarter mile radius) of the city's town center (TC zoning district). This district does not have an established development pattern, and it is applied to undeveloped areas in the City where higher density, single-family development is encouraged. In order to provide for a diversity of housing opportunities, while maintaining high-quality development standards, this district requires multiparcel development or the subdivision of an existing parcel to provide a variety of lot sizes and house sizes, within the minimum lot size and average (mean) house size standards specified above. In the R-7.5 zoning district, new development must adhere to principles of traditional neighborhood development, including pedestrian orientation and street connectivity.

                  Sec. 40-285. - Purpose and intent. 
                  (a)  The RTH zoning district is established to permit single-family attached dwellings on small lots under fee simple ownership (also called fee simple townhouses). This district establishes a minimum lot size of 2,400 square feet (0.055 acre) and a minimum lot width of 24 feet for fee simple townhouse lots, but townhouse development is also subject to a maximum density threshold of 12 lots (dwellings) per acre. This means that some lots (i.e., those at the end of a building containing attached townhouses) will have to be larger in order to meet the overall density maximum. A house size (heated floor area per dwelling unit) of 1,000 square feet is established for fee simple townhouse dwellings and fee simple homes constructed on zero-lot line lots. Public water service is available. Sanitary sewer is also available and required for new lots platted in this zoning district. 
                  (b)  Rezoning to the R-TH zoning district within established R-7.5 zoned areas may be considered appropriate, in order to provide more affordable housing opportunities, subject to site development and architectural design review. This district is not considered appropriate within established R-30, R-20, and R-15 zoned neighborhoods, nor is it considered appropriate for designation in the Historic Oxford character area established on the future development map of the city comprehensive plan, as described in the community agenda, nor is it considered appropriate in the town neighborhood character area, except for those portions zoned R-7.5 within the residential Infill Development Overlay Zoning District. In the R-TH zoning district, new development must adhere to principles of traditional neighborhood development, including pedestrian orientation and street connectivity.

                  Sec. 40-345. - Purpose and intent. 
                  (a)  The Institutional Campus (IC) District provides opportunity for large public or private, nonprofit institutional uses, including college/university campuses, primary and secondary schools, medical facility complexes, recreational complexes, and similar campus-oriented institutions, to develop and function as holistic campus areas with unique needs and characteristics. 
                  (b)  The IC district shall apply to public and private institutional uses in the following circumstances: 
                  (1)  Total land area under the ownership, management, or control of a single legal entity and its ancillaries is equal to or greater than five acres, and individual parcels are contiguous, or proximate (when bisected by public streets or thoroughfares). 
                  (2)  Multiple principal buildings are located on a single parcel, or on adjacent or proximate parcels, and support a common institutional purpose (i.e., education or recreation). 
                  (3)  Total population of the legal entity's employees, students, members, or patrons is equal to or greater than 500. The Planning Commission may recommend that the City Council apply this district in other circumstances as deemed necessary and appropriate. 
                  (c)  The primary intent of this division is to enable the City to plan for significant development anticipated within the IC District, and, in cooperation and coordination with the institutions within the IC district, ensure infrastructure, utilities, land use, transportation and public safety issues (and other issues that may arise) are adequately addressed. Given the holistic nature and significant scale of institutions within the IC district, development proposals and land uses must be considered in light of the cumulative effect on public facilities, infrastructure and services as well as public health, safety and welfare. Therefore, institutions within the IC district are required to create and maintain a future development plan consistent with the City comprehensive plan. 
                  (d)  The future development plan is programmatic in nature, presenting anticipated needs for development or use of buildings and land within the district, as a holistic campus environment, over a ten year planning horizon. The future development plan provides input necessary for the City to maintain its comprehensive plan in accordance with state minimum standards and procedures. 
                  (e)  The future development plan shall identify options for arrangements of buildings and spaces, and their respective uses, and may be updated and resubmitted at any time, to provide flexibility in its execution and to account for uncertainty within the planning horizon. The future development plan shall be updated, if necessary, when applications for development permits for new projects are submitted, and a development permit shall not be issued if the future development plan has not been reviewed and accepted by the City Council.

                  Sec. 40-424. - Purpose and intent. 
                  The City has undertaken an effort to revitalize its historic core by creating a conceptual center master plan, shown in this section. The town center master plan shows the potential build-out of parcels within the study area. For the purposes of implementing the development of the town center, it will also serve as the regulating plan for the town center district code. A regulating plan defines the desired physical form and sets development parameters such as land use, street type, building height, siting and setbacks, and parking placement. It will serve as a guide for city officials, property owners, and development professionals as they conceive and implement improvements and development projects within the town center area. 
                  Conceptual Town Center Design 
                  (Code 1997, § 40-414; Ord. of 2-6-2012, § 1(40-414)) 
                  Sec. 40-425. - Regulating framework. 
                  (a)  Town center district build-to-lines. The build-to line is better for "place making" than the standard zoning practice of setting minimum setbacks. It provides uniformity along a street front and lends to pedestrian scale by requiring buildings to be placed at the build-to line (shown in red) in the town center district (area shown in brown), the setback is from the build-to line rather than the right-of-way. 

                  Town Center District 


                  (b)  Description. The town center district code provides a template for establishing a mixed-use, main street character. It is intended to provide the west side of Emory Street (State Route 81) with a consistent ground-floor retail corridor that is both attractive and pedestrian friendly. The ground floor of buildings in this district should be commercial/retail use, with upper floors use for office, retail or residential uses. 

                  (1)  Setbacks from build-to-line or property line. The following table shall be the setbacks from build-to-line or property line: 

                   
                  Shopfront and mixed-use buildings may extend their front setback requirements up to ten feet in order to comply with the outdoor dining requirements. If this is exercised, the extended area may only be used for the purposes of outdoor dining. 
                  (2)  Outdoor dining. Outdoor eating areas are permitted in the town center district where a sidewalk area (private plus public) of at least 12 feet in continuous width is provided. A clear area of at least five feet wide must be provided in the public sidewalk for passage by pedestrians, patrons and servers.

                  Sec. 40-428. - Public space standards. 
                  (a)  Streets in the City are to be inviting public space and integral components of community design. All streets should connect to help create a comprehensive network of public areas to allow free movement of automobiles, bicyclists and pedestrians. In order for this street network to be safe for motorists and pedestrians, all design elements must consistently be applied to calm automobile traffic. 
                  (b)  Streets should be designed to suit their functions. Many streets, especially local ones, have purposes other than vehicular traffic. The following street designs are provided for non-state-maintained streets within the municipal limits. 
                  (c)  Designs should permit comfortable use of the street by motorists, pedestrians, and bicyclists. Pavement widths, design speeds, and the number of motor travel lanes should be minimized to enhance safety for motorists and non-motorists alike. The specific design of any given street must consider the building types which have frontage and the relationship of the street to the overall town street network. 
                  (d)  The illustrations on the following page present typical examples of ways in which street cross-sections can be assembled. Lane measurements represent the width of travel lanes; adding two feet for standard curb and gutter is required.

                  Sec. 40-429. - Complete streets. 
                  All new or renovated transportation infrastructure in the city's town center should adhere to the concept of complete streets. Complete streets achieve safety, comfort and convenience for all modes of travel, including pedestrians, and bicyclists in addition to automobile traffic. The following is a checklist of elements that should be incorporated into all new developments or transportation projects in the town center district: 
                  (1)  Offer a full range of travel choices. 
                  (2)  Provide sidewalks either separated by a park strip or with ample width to provide pedestrian safety on all new roads. 
                  (3)  Include bicycle facilities on new major roadways and retrofit existing major roadways with reconstruction projects. 
                  (4)  Connect to a network that offers choice. 
                  (5)  Provide safe pedestrian crossings at intersections. 
                  (6)  Provide full accessibility to all, including kids, seniors, and people with disabilities. 
                  (7)  Contribute to the pleasant and convenient pedestrian atmosphere of the downtown area.

                  Sec. 40-431. - Street standards. 
                  (a)  Intersections. 
                  (1)  Segments of straight streets should be interrupted by intersections designed to: 
                  a.  Disperse traffic flow and reduce speeds, thereby eliminating the creation of de facto collector streets with high speed, high volume traffic; and 
                  b.  Terminate vistas with a significant natural feature, a building, a small park, or other public space. 
                  (2)  Other traffic calming measures such as neckdowns, chicanes, mid-block diverters, intersection diverters, curb bulbs, and related devices will be considered on a case by case basis, based on safety and appropriateness in the proposed location. 
                  (b)  Access management. Access management should be a critical component of thoroughfare design, land subdivision and property development, especially along major thoroughfares. Access management techniques should be used in the town center district wherever possible to keep the area's thoroughfares functioning safely and efficiently. Good access management on major roads should employ one or more of the following: 
                  (1)  Shared driveways or alleyways with inter-parcel access between adjacent commercial properties. 
                  (2)  Minimizing of curb cuts to reduce ingress/egress along major roads. 
                  (3)  Adequate throat length to accommodate stacking of vehicles merging into a thoroughfare from a driveway. 
                  (4)  Landscaped medians to control left turns or U-turns between intersections. 
                  (5)  Road connectivity and circulation increasing the number of alternative routes. 
                  (6)  Alternatively, the following characteristics are contrary to good access management, and should be avoided if at all possible: 
                  a.  Continuous two-way left turn lanes. 
                  b.  Multiple curb cuts for one development or adjacent group or row of businesses. 
                  c.  Individual parking lots for each business or parcel. 
                  (c)  Off-street parking standards. 
                  (1)  Off-street parking areas should be designed to minimize breaks in the pedestrian environment along the public street and create safe and comfortable passage for pedestrians. The following standards shall apply in the City: 
                  a.  Parking lots shall be placed behind buildings; side of the building parking will be permitted only as indicated by building type and shall be measured along the build-to line. Off-street parking is not permitted in front of the primary building facade, except where specified in an adopted street section. 
                  b.  Uninterrupted areas of parking lot shall be limited in size. Large parking lots shall be broken by buildings or landscape features. 
                  c.  Parking lots are to be treated as enclosed rooms for cars, with enclosure provided by tree planting or building walls. For small lots (30 spaces or less), landscaping shall be required at the perimeter; for large lots (more than 30 spaces), landscaping shall include one canopy tree and ten shrubs planted for every ten parking spaces. 
                  d.  Parking lots shall be designed to allow pedestrians to safely move from their vehicles to the building. On small lots, this may be achieved by providing a sidewalk at the perimeter of the lot. On larger lots, corridors within the parking area should channel pedestrians from the car to the perimeter of the lot or to the building. These corridors may be delineated by a paving material which differs from that of vehicular areas and planted to provide shade. Small posts or bollards may be included. 
                  e.  To maintain pedestrian comfort and calm the speed of entering traffic, driveways to parking areas should be no wider than 24 feet. Driveways connecting to state roads shall meet the requirements of the state department of transportation. 
                  f.  To the extent practicable, adjoining parking lots serving non residential buildings shall be inter-connected. 
                  g.  All commercial driveway and parking areas shall be paved with asphalt, concrete, or brick pavers except for areas used for overflow, special events, and peak parking. 
                  (2)  Amount required. While it is expected that on-street parking will contribute substantially to every day parking needs, sufficient off-street parking must also be provided to serve the particular needs of the buildings. The following minimum requirements apply: 
                  a.  Residential. 
                  1.  One bedroom dwelling unit: one space. 
                  2.  Dwelling units with more than one bedroom: 1.5 spaces. 
                  b.  Commercial: one space per 500 square feet. 
                  c.  Office: one space per 500 square feet. 
                  d.  Civic: one space per 300 square feet. 
                  e.  Hotels and inns: one space per room plus one space per 500 square feet of ancillary use. 
                  (3)  Exceptions. 
                  a.  Within the town center district boundaries, existing buildings which were legally constructed without the provision of on site parking, and infill housing on existing lots of record may meet requirements with on-street parking and will be construed conforming as to parking. 
                  b.  Where vehicular access is provided between adjoining non residential sites and the peak operating hours of adjoining uses do not overlap, the uses may share up to 50 percent of required parking spaces. Shared use of parking shall be guaranteed by a contract or other legally binding agreement. 
                  (d)  Sidewalk standards. 
                  (1)  Sidewalks are required on both sides of public streets, except low traffic local roads and alleys. 
                  (2)  Along the west side of Emory Street, sidewalks should be a minimum of eight feet in width in the town center district. 
                  (3)  Sidewalks shall be a minimum be six feet in width in the town center district. 
                  (e)  Street lighting standards. 
                  (1)  The purpose of street lighting is to ensure public safety and welfare and to protect the night sky. 
                  (2)  Street lights shall in all cases use fully shielded fixtures except that decorative street light fixtures shall be designed with caps so that light does not shine upward at more than a 135-degree angle measured above straight down (three-quarters of the way between straight down and straight to the top) from the pole or mounting wall. The Planning Commission may approve the use of decorative light fixtures as an alternative to fully shielded fixtures, where such fixtures would enhance the aesthetics without causing light pollution. 
                  (f)  Street tree standards. 
                  (1)  The purpose of this section is to regulate the protection, installation, and long-term management of trees and shrubs within the City. The regulation of street trees along public and private streets within the City ensures a pedestrian-friendly environment along with providing distinct aesthetic, economic, and environmental significance. 
                  (2)  Street trees are required to be within a minimum four-foot planting strip located between the existing street and proposed sidewalk. 
                  (3)  Street tree planting shall be provided as follows: 
                  a.  Large maturing canopy trees shall be planted at a spacing not to exceed 40 feet on center except that spacing may be altered slightly to accommodate driveways. 
                  b.  Small maturing canopy-like trees shall be planted 30 feet on center where existing overhead utility lines prohibit the use of large maturing canopy trees. 
                  (g)  Public open space. 
                  (1)  A plaza is an open area adjacent to a civic or commercial building. Plazas function as public gathering spaces and may incorporate a variety of non-permanent activities, such as vendors and display stands. Plazas are always paved in brick or another type of paver, or crushed stone. Plazas shall be level, stepped, or gently sloping (less than five percent grade). 
                  (2)  Plazas may not have trees or planted materials. However, trees may form the geometric frame of the plaza space or for the structure the plaza services. Spacing shall be a minimum of ten feet on center and 30 feet on center maximum.

                  Sec. 40-461. - Purpose and intent. 
                  (a)  This zoning district is not intended to apply if one or more of the city zoning districts specified in this article will accommodate the existing or proposed development on the property to be annexed. It is recognized, however, that unincorporated land annexed by the City in the future may consist of uses which are not permitted in any of the city zoning districts established in this division. Therefore, this zoning district is created as a flexible zoning district intended to facilitate application of a variety of zoning regulations to annexed lands which are not otherwise accommodated by the city's base zoning districts. This zoning district is not initially mapped in the City, but may be applied at the time a given property is proposed for annexation into the City if the other city zoning districts established in this article do not accommodate or facilitate the development on land to be annexed. 
                  (b)  Adoption by reference of the Newton County Zoning Ordinance and its base zoning districts provides the flexibility needed to annex property into the City with zoning regulations that are the same as those applicable in the unincorporated County at the time of annexation, but which are otherwise not established and applied within the city limits as they exist on the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived.

                  Sec. 40-462. - Adoption of the County zoning ordinance. 
                  (a)  For purposes of assigning zoning in the City to land annexed after the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, the City adopts the Newton County Zoning Ordinance. A copy of the county zoning ordinance as adopted and as amended on the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived shall be adopted by reference as if fully set forth herein, and the City Administrator shall maintain a copy of the ordinance in the permanent records of the City. 
                  (b)  Procedurally, the public hearing and other provisions of this chapter shall govern the public hearing requirements for rezoning, as opposed to those procedures of the county zoning ordinance. The city's adoption of the county zoning ordinance is intended only to facilitate use limitations by base zoning district, specific use standards, and property development standards for specific properties at the time of annexation. However, any other provisions of the county zoning ordinance, such as definitions and general provisions, that are necessarily and reasonably related to the application of these selected provisions of county's zoning ordinance shall be applicable and interpreted to apply to property annexed by the City, except as otherwise specifically modified per this section.

                  Sec. 40-463. - Zoning application requirements. 
                  (a)  An applicant for annexation shall first determine whether an city zoning district specified in this chapter, other than the Newton County Annexed District established in this section, will accommodate the existing or proposed development on the land to be annexed. If it is determined that another zoning district will accommodate the existing or proposed development, the annexation applicant shall file a rezoning request for one of the city's base zoning districts, rather than this Newton County Annexed District. 
                  (b)  If it is determined the applicant's existing or proposed development cannot be accommodated by the city's base zoning districts established in this chapter, then the applicant shall propose a zoning district or zoning districts from the base zoning districts specified in article 2 of the county's zoning ordinance that will accommodate the existing or proposed development on the property to be annexed.

                  Sec. 40-464. - Permitted and conditional uses. 
                  Permitted and conditional uses shall be as specified in article 5 of the county's zoning ordinance for the county base zoning district proposed by the applicant, except as may be modified in this subsection. Unless otherwise specifically indicated in the rezoning application and approved by the City Council, the permitted and conditional uses in the county base zoning district applied for and approved as applicable to the annexed land shall govern the property once annexed into the city limits. An applicant for annexation and rezoning may propose and the City Council may approve modifications to the permitted and conditional uses specified for one or more base zoning districts in the county zoning ordinance, as a part of the application for rezoning at the time of annexation.

                  Sec. 40-465. - Specific use standards. 
                  When the application for annexation and rezoning involves a use for which specific use standards are applicable per article 5 of the county zoning ordinance, those use standards shall be applicable to the uses upon their establishment or continuance in the City, except as may be modified in this subsection. Unless otherwise specifically indicated in the rezoning application and approved by the City Council, the specific use standards of article 5 of the county zoning ordinance shall govern the use of property once annexed into the city limits. An applicant for annexation and rezoning may propose and the City Council may approve modifications to the applicable specific use standards articulated in article 5 of the county zoning ordinance, as a part of the application for rezoning at the time of annexation.

                  Sec. 40-466. - Dimensional requirements. 
                  Dimensional requirements shall be as specified in the property development standards section of the base county zoning district applied for, as articulated in the county zoning ordinance, except as may be modified in this section. Unless otherwise specifically indicated in the rezoning application and approved by the City Council, the property development standards in the county base zoning district applied for and approved as applicable to the annexed land shall govern the property once annexed into the city limits. An applicant for annexation and rezoning may propose and the City Council may approve modifications to the applicable property development standards articulated in one or more applicable base zoning districts in the county zoning ordinance, as a part of the application for rezoning at the time of annexation.

                  There are no design criteria specifically applied in this zoning district in advance, since a wide variety of development may be approved for annexation per this section. However, the City may apply any design principles and guidelines articulated in this chapter as conditions of rezoning approval, at the time of annexation and rezoning in Oxford.

                  DIVISION 16. - RESIDENTIAL INFILL OVERLAY DISTRICT 

                  Sec. 40-488. - Purpose and intent. 
                  (a)  This division establishes an overlay district superimposed on certain residentially zoned parcels of land in the City which are anticipated to be developed with residences. Small-scale projects on small sites require successful melding into the fabric, architecture, function, and circulation of an existing neighborhood. Infill residential development should not overpower nearby buildings or disrupt other uses. Infill residential dwellings should be similar in height and setbacks to neighboring dwellings. Bulk and scale should be similar to and consistent with the surrounding neighborhood. The overall design strategy for a residential infill dwelling or development should focus on compatible integration with the surrounding area. 
                  (b)  The residential infill overlay district is intended to ensure that new dwellings in the city's residential neighborhoods and the replacement of residential dwellings will not differ dramatically in size, footprint, mass, or height, or change the dominant character of the existing residential neighborhoods. This division contains regulations that are designed to ensure that residential infill development is compatible with existing development and that new residential construction or substantial rehabilitation of detached dwelling units fit within the existing community character in a compatible manner. This division provides detailed design guidance for residentially zoned but vacant properties within the overlay district to encourage quality site design and construction in accordance with the city's comprehensive plan. 
                  (c)  This division is also applied in recognition of the fact that many lots within the residential infill overlay district, while large enough for additional dwellings and lots, pose significant design challenges given the irregular shape of the tract, the lack of sufficient lot frontage on a public street, substantial area within a 100-year floodplain, or other peculiarities and conditions which present practical difficulty in meeting conventional zoning requirements such as minimum lot sizes and minimum lot widths. Furthermore, this division recognizes that conventional zoning regulatory constraints may work against good design, raise roadblocks against innovation, or prevent projects that are otherwise consistent with the character of existing communities or consistent with the city's adopted principles and objectives for residential development. 
                  (d)  In addition, difficult sites and uncertain outcomes and timeframes can reduce developers' economic interest in undertaking infill projects. And, through sensitive design, infill can introduce a new type of housing into the community. A balanced mix of well-designed housing types, sizes and prices for all income levels can be accomplished with similar housing styles on the same street and phase of construction, if economies of scale allow. Infill can inject new life into communities and help neighborhoods become more connected and sociable places, and ultimately increase property values, without altering existing neighborhood and community character. 
                  (e)  Accordingly, significant design flexibility is provided for designers of residential infill development projects and discretion is provided to the City Planning Commission in order to help infill developers meet the challenges that their properties pose while ensuring that density at lot yields are possible in view of the city's objectives for quality infill housing. 
                  (Code 1997, § 40-501; Ord. of 2-6-2012, § 1(40-501)) 
                  Sec. 40-489. - Applicability and exemption. 
                  (a)  This division shall apply to any application for development permit within the boundaries of the residential infill overlay district as shown on the official zoning map of the City, except as specifically exempted in this section. It also applies at the time of preliminary plat approval, if required by chapter 30, pertaining to subdivisions, or final plat application if no final plat is required per that chapter. 
                  (b)  When this division applies, no plat of subdivision, including combination plats and boundary line adjustments, shall be approved unless compliance with this chapter is first demonstrated. No development permit for a proposed development to which this division applies shall be approved until compliance with this chapter is demonstrated. No building permit for a new dwelling within the residential infill overlay district shall be issued unless compliance with this division is demonstrated. 
                  (c)  This division shall not apply to applications for building permits for accessory structures 400 square feet or less in area. This division shall not apply to a remodel of an existing dwelling or a permit proposal which would increase the existing ground floor area of a dwelling by less than 250 percent. 
                  (Code 1997, § 40-502; Ord. of 2-6-2012, § 1(40-502)) 
                  Sec. 40-490. - Combination of review and approval processes. 
                  (a)  In considering the compatibility and appropriateness of residential development within the residential infill overlay district, it is important that the City consider not only the proposed lot lines and lot platting configurations, but also the specific residential development proposed on the lots. The process for acting on infill residential development projects is accomplished by filing information required for both site design and architectural review and information required for applications for plat approval. 
                  (b)  Therefore, within the overlay district boundary, the process of site design and architectural review for individual developments may be combined with the subdivision platting process required by this Code. At the option of the development applicant, an applicant may submit a conceptual lot platting plan and defer the plat approval process until a later date, but if so, the applicant is still responsible for submitting information required by this chapter with respect to proposed lot boundaries as a part of the site design and architectural review process, so that subdivision lot design and specific residential development proposals can be considered as a whole.

                  Sec. 40-491. - Existing dwellings and infill development comparison. 
                  (a)  The City reviews residential infill development proposals in the context of the surrounding neighborhood. Therefore, in addition to the requirements specified for submission of applications for site design and architectural review, an applicant for development permit or subdivision plat approval in the residential infill overlay district shall submit the following information for existing residential dwellings on abutting residential properties and across the street from the lot on which the residential infill development project is proposed. An applicant may exclude lots abutting the proposed residential infill development project which are developed for institutional uses, such as schools and churches, or other nonresidential uses. 
                  (1)  Number of stories and approximate height. 
                  (2)  Size (gross square feet) in area. 
                  (3)  Front, side, and rear setbacks. 
                  (4)  Lot coverage (amount of lot covered by building). 
                  (5)  Orientation of the dwelling in relation to the street. 
                  (6)  Major architectural features (style, materials, etc.). 
                  (7)  Driveway placement, width, and materials. 
                  (8)  Location of parking (garage, carport, open, yard location, etc.). 
                  (9)  Typical accessory buildings and structures, if any. 
                  (b)  The applicant may submit this information in a combination of forms, including an aerial photograph, tax map, survey plats, photographs, and written narrative, provided all required information is submitted. The applicant must also describe the proposed development and describe systematically how proposed residential dwellings will compare with the existing dwellings in the area. This should be done in the form of a comparison chart in a written narrative.

                  Sec. 40-492. - Lot size averaging. 
                  Where unique site specific conditions exist, such as an irregular shape or other unique conditions, an infill developer or subdivider may propose and the City Planning Commission may approve a flexible development incentive called lot size averaging. This incentive allows development applicants to reduce one or more lots below the minimum lot size established for the zoning district in which the residential infill development project is located. In order to apply this provision, the proposed residential infill development project must meet the following requirements: 
                  (1)  The average lot area of all lots within the subdivision meets the minimum lot size for the zoning district in which the project is located. 
                  (2)  No lot shall be reduced to less than 80 percent of the required minimum lot size for the applicable zoning district. 
                  (3)  For purposes of calculating average lot size, abutting undivided and undeveloped property under the ownership of the infill subdivider at the time of infill subdivision shall not be included in such calculation.

                  Where unique site specific conditions exist, such as an irregular shape or other unique conditions, an infill developer or subdivider may propose and the City Planning Commission may approve a flexible development incentive called lot width variations. In order to apply this provision, individual lots in the proposed residential infill development project may be decreased as follows: 
                  (1)  To no less than 80 feet in the R-30 or R-20 zoning districts; 
                  (2)  To no less than 60 feet in the R-15 zoning district; and 
                  (3)  To no less than 45 feet in the R-7.5 zoning district.

                  Where unique site specific conditions exist, such as an irregular shape or other unique conditions, an infill developer or subdivider may propose and the City Planning Commission may approve a flexible development incentive called building setback adjustments. In order to apply this provision, required minimum building setbacks/required yards for individual lots in the proposed residential infill development project may be decreased as follows: 
                  (1)  Where a build-to line does not apply and the front building setbacks of the zoning district are applicable, such front building setbacks may be reduced by up to five feet from the established minimum. 
                  (2)  Rear building setbacks of the zoning district may be reduced by up to five feet from the established minimum. 
                  (3)  No principal building setback reduction shall be allowed for side yards pursuant to this section, although the variance process shall provide a potential remedy.

                  Sec. 40-495. - Requirements when floodplain exists. 
                  If the tract to be developed as a residential infill development project contains 5,000 square feet or more of land within the designated 100-year floodplain, or if more than 20 percent of the lot lies within the 100-year floodplain, then an infill developer or subdivider may propose and the City Planning Commission may approve flexible development regulations as follows, subject to the following requirements: 
                  (1)  The overall maximum density for the zoning district in which the infill development tract is located cannot be exceeded, but such density calculation may include all land within the 100-year floodplain. 
                  (2)  Minimum lot sizes for the zoning district in which the infill development tract is located may be reduced to as little as 70 percent of the applicable minimum lot size requirement. 
                  (3)  Minimum lot widths for the zoning district in which the infill development tract is located may be reduced to as little as 65 percent of the applicable minimum lot width requirement, except that no lot shall be reduced below a minimum lot width of 45 feet. 
                  (4)  All, or a substantial portion (as determined by the Planning Commission) of that part of the tract containing 100-year floodplain shall be designated and protected via fee simple title or via conservation easement as open space, and each lot and dwelling within the infill residential development project shall have pedestrian access provided to such designated and protected open space.

                  Sec. 40-496. - Street connectivity east of Emory Street (SR 81). 
                  (a)  It is the intention of the City that as residential infill development occurs on tracts east of Emory Street (SR 81), that a continuous connector road be provided so that connectivity among all such tracts can be provided and thus avoid reliance on the state highway for access and connections among developments. Accordingly, each residential infill development project proposed east of Emory Street (SR 81) will be evaluated for and required to provide a road right-of-way from the south and north property lines through the entire tract to be subdivided and development. 
                  (b)  The specifications for the road right-of-way to be dedicated will be as described in chapter 30, pertaining to subdivisions, for local streets, or as may be modified by the City Planning Commission during the process of site design and architectural review for the proposed residential infill project. Any right-of-way dedicated for purposes of this required connector road may be included in calculations of maximum density permitted for the proposed residential infill development project. 
                  (c)  A residential infill development project that does not provide for property line to property line access in a north-south direction and adequate access in an east-west direction shall be grounds for disapproval by the City Planning Commission of site design and architectural review and any subdivision plat for the proposed project.

                  Any residential infill development project with property frontage on Emory Street (SR 81) shall be limited to one street exit/entrance onto Emory Street (SR 81), or one shared driveway in the case where a new road is not proposed. Where the tract to be developed also has frontage on a side public street in addition to frontage on Emory Street (SR 81), the Planning Commission may limit access for the residential infill development project to the side public street and preclude access to Emory Street (SR 81).

                  All exterior wall materials of dwellings within infill residential development projects shall consist of brick masonry, stone masonry, wood clapboards, fiber cement, or weather boarding, and appropriate architectural accents as approved by the City Planning Commission as a part of site design and architectural review. Standing-seam or corrugated metal walls or vinyl siding shall not be permitted on any facade or building wall. Architectural treatments shall occur on all four sides of the building. Roof materials shall be asphalt composition, wood shake, tile, or standing seam metal.

                  Sec. 40-499. - Stormwater treatment and ponds. 
                  Designers should make every effort to employ low impact development methods for stormwater management as specified or approved by the City Planning Commission. In cases where bio-retention or other low impact development methods cannot be employed or will necessitate a detention (dry) or retention (wet) pond, any such pond within the boundaries of an infill residential development project shall meet the following requirements: 
                  (1)  It shall not be located adjacent to a city street or subdivision frontage. 
                  (2)  It shall be located no closer than 15 feet to an exterior property line. 
                  (3)  It shall be sloped so that fencing is not required. 
                  (4)  It shall be landscaped subject to the approval of the Zoning Administrator.

                  Sec. 40-500. - Additional design criteria for approval. 
                  The following design criteria will be considered by the City Planning Commission in the process of consideration applications for site design and architectural review of residential infill development projects within the residential infill overlay district: 
                  (1)  Connectivity. Infill should achieve connectivity between on site and off-site transportation systems, streetscapes, and open space networks. Sidewalks need to be provided which connect to the existing or planned adjacent sidewalk system, and streets need to connect to the adjacent existing or planned street pattern. 
                  (2)  Circulation. If the infill development is large enough, new streets should be laid out as an interconnected, multi-modal network (usually in a grid or modified grid pattern) to maintain continuity of the existing community's circulation system. New street systems should meet the needs of bicyclists, strollers, wheelchairs, pedestrians and motor vehicles. The overall transportation strategy should favor walkability over automobile travel. Access control may be an important component; curb cuts should be minimized whenever possible. Closed street systems and cul-de-sacs shall be avoided. Blocks should be short to increase turning opportunities and heighten pedestrian orientation. 
                  (3)  Alley garages. Garages accessed by alleys can enhance the design and function of infill projects and therefore should be considered and implemented as appropriate. 
                  (4)  Teardowns. Replacement structures that differ dramatically in size, footprint, mass, or height change the dominant character of the neighborhood. Teardowns typically occur in areas with low-cost houses and valuable lots, particularly when smaller, poorly designed, or obsolete structures without modern amenities are not considered historic or quaint. The City Planning Commission may direct an applicant to alter the design of a proposed replacement residence where it is considered grossly out of scale or character with existing homes in the neighborhood. If the replacement structure is proposed to be taller or a larger number of stories than exists on abutting or nearby parcels in the neighborhood, the Planning Commission shall be guided by the following considerations in determining whether such additional height is appropriate and compatible, in addition to compatible neighborhood scale: privacy, light and shadow, views, and architectural compatibility.

                  (a)  Decisions on applications for wireless service; special use. Decisions on applications for wireless service facilities shall be made within a reasonable period of time, which means generally that such decisions shall be processed in roughly the same amount of time required for other special use applications. Applications that do not require a special use permit shall be acted upon by the Planning Commission within 30 days of the date the application is considered by the Planning Commission to be complete. 
                  (b)  Application for wireless telecommunication towers; supplemental information. Each application for a wireless telecommunication tower shall include the following, which are in addition to the information required for special use applications generally, if required: 
                  (1)  A recorded plat or boundary survey. 
                  (2)  A site plan, based on with topographical information. 
                  (3)  An elevation view, perspective drawing, or simulated photograph of how the proposed telecommunication tower will look from public rights-of-way and surrounding residential streets from which it will be visible once constructed. 
                  (4)  Supporting engineering calculations and information which provide evidence of need and document radio frequency range, coverage area, and tower height requirements. The application must specifically address whether there is a technically suitable space available on an existing tower or other location within the search area (i.e., the grid for the placement of the antenna), and such information shall specifically include the location of all existing towers within a one-mile radius of the site proposed. 
                  (c)  Performance and construction standards. Performance and construction standards include the following: 
                  (1)  Structural design. New communication towers or poles and antennae, and modifications to existing structures (including, without limitation, the addition of height, antennae or providers), shall be constructed in accordance with applicable federal, state and local regulations. 
                  (2)  Placement restrictions. Towers occupying a lot as a principal use shall meet, at minimum, the minimum lot size and setback requirements for the zoning district in which the lot is located. Towers shall be a minimum of 300 feet from any residential zoning district and a minimum of 500 feet from any single-family residence. The tower shall also be set back from property lines a distance equal to or greater than the tower height. All towers shall be located at least one-third of their height in feet from any public right-of-way. All accessory structures will meet the normal setbacks for the districts in which they are located. When the tower is on property leased, the setbacks shall apply to the lot of record, not the lease boundaries. 
                  (3)  Screening. The visual impacts of a communication tower at the ground level shall be mitigated by landscaping. All towers and accessory structures shall be surrounded on the ground by a minimum ten foot wide landscape strip or buffer that forms a hardy screen dense enough to interrupt vision and shield the base and accessory structures from public view and view from the surrounding properties. The buffer shall consist of evergreens that will reach a minimum height of at least eight feet within three years. 
                  (4)  Fencing. A black vinyl-coated chain link fence or wall not less than six feet in height from finished grade shall be provided around each communication tower or pole. Access to the tower or pole shall be through a locked gate. The tower or pole shall be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device, unless the Planning Commission waives this requirement for alternative tower structures. 
                  (5)  Height. 
                  a.  Through approval of a special use application, when one is required, the height of the tower may exceed the maximum height limit of the zoning district in which it is located, up to a height of 200 feet, subject to the limitations of this subsection. If a special use application is not required for erection of the tower, and if the tower is to be placed in an OCC, OCF or C zoning district in a manner that exceeds the maximum height for the zoning district, then the applicant may exceed the height limitation of the applicable zoning district only through a zoning variance process. Towers shall be the minimum height necessary to provide parity with existing similar tower-supported antenna. No tower, pole, or antenna, whether freestanding or attached to a building or structure, shall exceed 200 feet in height from ground level unless a zoning variance is obtained. 
                  b.  To prevail in any variance application to exceed established maximum height limitations of this subsection or the zoning district in which it is located, the applicant must successfully demonstrate why the prescribed maximum height is insufficient to provide adequate service, or that a taller tower will be in the community's interest by avoiding the construction of one or more additional towers at a new location. 
                  (6)  Color and materials. 
                  a.  Communication towers not required to be painted or marked by the Federal Aviation Administration shall have either galvanized steel finish or be painted non-contrasting color approved by the Mayor and City Council to minimize the equipment's visibility. 
                  b.  If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical or closely compatible with the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible. 
                  (7)  Signs and advertising. No advertising is permitted on a tower or antenna. However, towers shall have mounted in a conspicuous place a sign of at least one square foot in area but not more than four square feet in area, identifying the facility's owner and providing a means of contact in the event of an emergency. 
                  (8)  Co-location. Proposed communication antennas may and are encouraged to co-locate onto existing communication towers. New or additional special use approval is not required for the addition of an antenna to an existing approved tower or pole. All towers over 100 feet in height shall have structural capacity and ground or interior space to accommodate multiple users. Towers up to 160 feet shall accommodate at least three users, and towers over 160 feet shall accommodate at least five users.

                  A nonconforming use may be continued even though such use does not conform with the use provisions of the zoning district in which the use is located, except as otherwise provided in this section. 
                  (1)  Change of use. A nonconforming use shall not be changed to another nonconforming use. A change in tenancy or ownership shall not be considered a change to another nonconforming use, provided that the use itself remains unchanged. 
                  (2)  Discontinuance or abandonment. A nonconforming use shall not be re-established after discontinuance or abandonment for one year. Vacancy or non-use of the building, regardless of the intent of the owner or tenant, shall constitute discontinuance or abandonment under this subsection. If a business registration is required for the nonconforming use and the business registration pertaining to the use has lapsed for more than six months, the lapse of business registration shall constitute discontinuance. 
                  (3)  Expansion. A nonconforming use shall not be expanded, enlarged or extended, in land area or in floor space or volume of space in a building or structure, except for a use which complies with the zoning district in which the use is located. 
                  (4)  Repair. A nonconforming use shall not be rebuilt, altered or repaired after damage exceeding 50 percent of its replacement cost at the time of damage as determined by the Building Inspector, except for a use which conforms with the zoning district in which the use is located, and provided such rebuilding, alteration or repair is completed within one year of such damage.

It is the intent of this section to require the complete correction of nonconforming situations at the time of any building addition or significant modification of a use or development on a given parcel of land, if such nonconforming situation can physically be made to comply with the requirements of this chapter. It is the intent of this section to require the reduction in the extent of nonconforming situations at the time of any building addition or significant modification of a use or development on a given parcel of land, if such nonconforming situation cannot be physically be made to comply entirely with the requirements of this chapter. It is the intent of this section to provide authority to the Zoning Administrator to administer the provisions of this section in a manner that meets these intentions, and that the Zoning Administrator shall exercise that authority, subject to more specific guidance as provided in this section. 
                  (b)  Determination of nonconforming situations. For any proposed building or development, or modification of a building or development, it shall be the duty of the Zoning Administrator to identify the extent to which the improvements on land on which the building or development is proposed constitutes a nonconforming situation, as defined in section 40-3. The Zoning Administrator shall conduct a review and identify such nonconforming situations at the time plans for such proposed building or development are submitted for review, and at any earlier opportunity, if presented. In the event that one or more nonconforming situations are found to exist by the Zoning Administrator, they shall be documented and notice of the need to correct or reduce the nonconforming situations shall be provided by the Zoning Administrator to the building or development applicant. 
                  (c)  Correction of nonconforming situations. In determining the need to completely correct or reduce the noncompliance of nonconforming situations, the Zoning Administrator shall be guided by the following standards: 
                  (1)  Strict compliance. A standard of strict compliance (complete correction of all nonconforming situations) shall be applied by the Zoning Administrator where physical standards can clearly be made in the subject development proposal without significant alteration of the development as proposed. 
                  (2)  Reasonable progress toward compliance. In lieu of strict compliance, a standard of reasonable progress toward compliance shall be applied by the Zoning Administrator in cases where complete correction or compliance with the nonconforming situation would require undue hardship, practical difficulty, or might unreasonably reduce the size, scale, or other significant aspect of the development proposal to a point where strict compliance would jeopardize the building or development proposal. In applying a standard of reasonable progress toward compliance, the Zoning Administrator shall have authority to approve the building, development, or improvement even though it does not meet a standard of strict compliance, if the relief granted is the minimum necessary to effectuate the building, development, or improvement. 
                  (3)  Proportionality. Whenever something less than strict compliance is authorized by the Zoning Administrator, in determining the amount or extent of compliance required, he shall apply a standard of "proportionality," meaning that the scope, scale, extent and cost of requirements to correct nonconforming situations are more or less the same as the scope, scale, extent and cost of the improvement or development proposed. 
                  (4)  Development permit required. Where building size, setbacks, or other regulated conditions are to be modified in the correction of a nonconforming situation, a development permit approval by the Planning Commission, according to the provisions of this chapter, shall be required.

                  ARTICLE VI. - AMENDMENTS 

                  Sec. 40-636. - Procedures for calling and conducting public hearings. 
                  (a)  Applicability. Public hearings by the City Council required by this chapter with regard to rezoning requests (amendments to the official zoning map), amendments to an overlay district boundary, applications for conditional uses, applications for variances, and appeals of any administrative decision shall be called and conducted in accordance with the procedures of this section. If the City Planning Commission elects to hold a public hearing or is otherwise obligated to hold a public hearing per the requirements of this chapter, then the Planning Commission shall call and conduct its public hearings in accordance with this section, and this section shall in such cases be interpreted accordingly. Nothing in this section shall be construed as prohibiting a presiding officer or hearing body from conducting a public hearing in a fair, orderly, and decorous manner. 
                  (b)  Presiding officer. The presiding officer shall preside over the public hearing. In the case of the City Council, the Mayor shall preside, or in the absence of the Mayor, the Mayor Pro Tempore shall preside, or in the absence of both the Mayor and Mayor Pro Tempore, another member of the City Council shall be designated to preside over the public hearing. In the case of the City Planning Commission, if a public hearing is required or held, the chairperson of the commission shall preside, or in the absence of the chairperson, the vice-chairperson if designated, or if neither is present to preside, another member of the commission shall be designated to preside. 
                  (c)  Opening of public hearing. The presiding officer shall indicate that a public hearing has been called on one or more applications made pursuant to this chapter, shall summarize the processes required by this article (or call on the Zoning Administrator to summarize), and shall open the public hearing. Thereupon, the presiding officer shall call the first case and the City Council shall consider each application on an individual basis in succession as printed on the published agenda or as otherwise approved by the City Council; provided, however, that the presiding officer may at his discretion call and consider more than one application simultaneously when more than one application involves the same piece of property, or when proceedings would be efficiently completed by combining separately required public hearings and discussing more than one scheduled matter as a single group of applications. 
                  (d)  Report of zoning administrator. Upon opening the public hearing, the presiding officer may recognize the Zoning Administrator, who may provide a summary of the application and present any recommendations or results of investigations. Unless a member of the City Planning Commission is present and is authorized and willing to speak for the Planning Commission on the subject application, the Zoning Administrator may also summarize the recommendations made by the City Planning Commission. Any member of the City Council upon recognition by the presiding officer may ask questions of the Zoning Administrator or designee or other city or Planning Commission representative providing a report or recommendations. The Zoning Administrator or Planning Commission may be represented at the public hearing by written report in lieu of oral testimony. 
                  (e)  Identification of speakers. Prior to speaking, each speaker (including applicant, agent of applicant, and all others) must identify himself and state his current address for the record. The presiding officer may require a speaker to complete an information card supplying such information, prior to testifying. 
                  (f)  Applicant and those in favor of the application. When an individual application comes up for hearing, the presiding officer may ask for a show of hands of those persons who wish to appear in support of the application. If it appears that the number of persons wishing to appear in support of the application is in excess of those who may reasonably be heard, the presiding officer may request that a spokesperson for the group be chosen to make presentations. Following the report of the Zoning Administrator or designee, or Planning Commission spokesperson, if any, the presiding officer shall recognize the applicant or his agent, spokesperson, or each of them, who shall present and explain the application, followed by any other persons wishing to speak in favor of the application. It shall be the duty of the applicant to carry the burden of proof that approval of the proposed application will promote the public health, safety, morality or general welfare. There shall be a minimum time period of ten minutes per application at the public hearing for the applicant or agent and anyone in favor of the application to present data, evidence, and opinions. The City Council shall not be obligated to provide the full ten-minute period to the proponents if they elect not to use that much time, nor shall there be an obligation to provide a minimum of ten minutes per application in the event that more than one application involving the same property is heard simultaneously. An applicant or agent may reserve any remaining unused time from the allotted time period for rebuttal. Upon the completion of testimony or remarks by the applicant or applicant's agent and those speaking in favor of the application, any member of the City Council upon recognition by the presiding officer may ask questions of the applicant or agent of the applicant, or both, or any person speaking in favor of the application. 
                  (g)  Questions and opposing public comments on the application. At the conclusion of the applicant's presentation and any testimony by others in favor of the application, the presiding officer shall call for public comments from those who wish to ask questions, make comments or oppose the application. The presiding officer may ask for a show of hands of those persons who wish to ask questions, make comments, or speak in opposition to the application. If it appears that the number of persons wishing to ask questions, make comments, or speak in opposition to the application is in excess of those who may reasonably be heard, the presiding officer may request that a spokesperson for the group be chosen to make presentations, ask questions, or speak in opposition. There shall be a minimum time period of ten minutes per application at the public hearing for the opponents to present data, evidence, and opinions and ask questions. The City Council shall not be obligated to provide the full ten minutes per application to the opponents if they elect not to use that much time, nor shall there be an obligation to provide a minimum of ten minutes per application in the event that more than one application involving the same property is heard simultaneously. Upon the completion of testimony or remarks by those asking questions or speaking in opposition to the application, any member of the City Council upon recognition by the presiding officer may ask questions of those speakers. 
                  (h)  Response to questions. Upon the completion of testimony or remarks by those asking questions or speaking in opposition to the application, the presiding officer may: 
                  (1)  Ask the Zoning Administrator, if present, to answer questions posed by speakers; 
                  (2)  Ask such questions himself; 
                  (3)  Recognize a member of the City Council to make remarks or answer questions in response to such questions; or 
                  (4)  Defer questions to the applicant to be answered during rebuttal. 
                  (i)  Content of remarks. Each speaker shall speak only to the merits of the proposed application under consideration and shall address his remarks only to the City Council and not directly to the audience. Each speaker shall refrain from personal attacks on any other speaker or the discussion of facts or opinions irrelevant to the proposed application under consideration. The presiding officer may limit or refuse a speaker the right to continue, if the speaker, after first being cautioned, continues to violate this procedure. 
                  (j)  Applicant's rebuttal. Upon the conclusion of public testimony, if the ten minutes allotted to the applicant and those speaking in favor of the application has not been exhausted, the applicant or his agent, or both, shall be allowed the remaining time from the total ten minutes allotted to answer questions, rebut the testimony of speakers, or provide final comments and remarks. The time devoted to any such rebuttal shall be counted toward the total ten minutes allotted to the applicant if such a time limit is set by the presiding officer. Any member of the City Council, upon recognition by the presiding officer, may then ask questions of the applicant, his agent, or both. 
                  (k)  Equal time. In no event shall this section be interpreted to, and in no case shall the presiding officer, allow or permit an unequal amount of time to proponents and opponents with respect to testimony regarding an individual application. 
                  (l)  Close of hearing. After the foregoing procedures have been completed, the presiding officer will close the public hearing and indicate that the public hearing is closed. Upon the closing of the public hearing, the applicant or his agent and any member of the public shall no longer be permitted to address the City Council in any way, including hand waving or motions for attention; provided, however, that at any time considered appropriate the presiding officer may reopen the public hearing for a limited time and purpose. 
                  (m)  Decision. After the public hearing is closed, the City Council may either vote upon the application or may delay its vote to a subsequent meeting, subject to the limitations of this article, provided that notice of the time, date and location when such application will be further considered shall be announced at the meeting during which the public hearing is held. After hearing evidence, in making a decision, the City Council will apply the evidence to the criteria specified in this article for the application in question and other considerations and recommendations as may be considered appropriate. If the City Council determines from the evidence presented by the applicant that the proposed application promotes the health, safety, morals, and general welfare under applicable criteria, then the application shall be granted, subject to those reasonable conditions as may be imposed by the City Council on its own initiative or as recommended by the Zoning Administrator or the City Planning Commission. Otherwise, such application shall be denied.

                  (b)  Authority to initiate. An application to amend this chapter may be initiated by the City Council or the City Planning Commission. In addition, any person, firm, corporation, or agency may initiate by application to the Zoning Administrator a proposal to amend the text of this chapter, provided the individual, firm, corporation, or agency is the owner or owner's agent of property in the City and the amendment sought pertains in some way to the property within the City, and provided further that the applicant has attended a pre-application meeting with the Zoning Administrator to discuss the amendment proposal prior to filing. 
                  (c)  Application. Applications to amend the text of this chapter shall require submittal of an application fee, application form, and proposed text amendment in a form approved in advance by the Zoning Administrator. The Zoning Administrator shall waive the application fee required by this section when an application is initiated by the City Council or the Planning Commission. 
                  (d)  Referral to and recommendation by Planning Commission. Upon receipt of a completed application for a text amendment or within a reasonable time thereafter, the Zoning Administrator shall refer the text amendment to the City Planning Commission. The meeting at which the Planning Commission considers a text amendment shall be open to the public, but the Planning Commission meeting shall not be required to be an advertised public hearing and the Planning Commission shall not be obligated to but may hold a public hearing on the text amendment. The Planning Commission shall make a recommendation on the text amendment within 30 days of the meeting it is first scheduled to consider the text amendment, and its recommendation shall be submitted to the City Council. The Planning Commission may submit any additional report it deems appropriate. The applicant will be notified in writing by the Zoning Administrator of the recommendation within seven working days of the decision. The recommendation and any report shall upon publication be available upon request to the public. The recommendation of the Planning Commission shall have an advisory effect only and shall not be binding on the City Council. 
                  (e)  Notice of City Council public hearing. At least 15 but not more than 45 days prior to the date of the public hearing before the City Council, the Zoning Administrator shall cause to be published within a newspaper of general circulation within the territorial boundaries of the City a notice of the public hearing on the text amendment. The notice shall state the time, place, and purpose of the public hearing. 
                  (f)  City Council public hearing and action. The City Council shall hold a public hearing on the text amendment as advertised and after review and recommendation by the Planning Commission. In the event that the Planning Commission has not submitted its report and the public hearing has already been advertised, the City Council may elect to proceed with the advertised and scheduled public hearing, or it may reschedule and readvertise the public hearing for a day after which the Planning Commission's recommendation will be available. In rendering a decision on any such text amendment, the City Council shall consider all information supplied by the Zoning Administrator and the Planning Commission, any information submitted by the applicant, and any information presented at the public hearing. The City Council may approve or disapprove the proposed text amendment as written, or it may modify the proposed text amendment and approve it as modified. The applicant will be notified in writing by the Zoning Administrator of the decision within seven working days of the decision.

                  Sec. 40-783. - Development of regional impact. 
                  (a)  Applicability. This section shall apply when an applicant (industry, business, or developer) requests some type of local government action related to a project, such as, but not limited to, a request for rezoning, zoning variance, permit, hookup to a water or sewer system, master or site plan approval, or entering into a contract, and it appears that the proposed development (or, for multi-phased projects, the complete development) meets the thresholds of a development of regional impact, according to Rules of Georgia Department of Community Affairs, Chapter 110-12-3, Developments of Regional Impact, as may be amended from time to time. 
                  (b)  Jurisdiction. If a proposed development project is to be located in more than one jurisdiction and, in total, the proposed development meets or exceeds a DRI threshold, the local government in which the largest portion of the project is to be located is responsible for initiating the DRI review process. 
                  (c)  Procedures. The application procedures established in this article will be modified by this section in cases where a rezoning request, conditional use application, or other application described in this article fits the definition of the term "development of regional impact." Developments of regional impact will be processed according to procedures of the state department of Community Affairs as described in Rules of Georgia Department of Community Affairs, chapter 110-12-3, Developments of Regional Impact, as may be amended from time to time, including but not limited to the following: 
                  (1)  The City will not take any official legislative or administrative action to advance or further a DRI project until the review process identified under the DRI review procedure specified in Rules of Georgia Department of Community Affairs, chapter 110-12-3, Developments of Regional Impact, as may be amended from time to time, is completed. The City may undertake preliminary staff administrative functions associated with a proposed DRI including, but not limited to, project evaluation/assessment, site visits, and placing consideration of the application on a future agenda for formal action, if required. The City shall not take any official action related to such a project until the DRI review process is completed and the City has had adequate time to consider the DRI review comments. 
                  (2)  After the DRI review process is completed, the City may proceed with whatever action it deems appropriate regarding the proposed project, although it is encouraged to take the public finding and additional comments into consideration as it makes its decision. 
                  (3)  If the project receives a negative public finding from the regional commission and the City approves the project or takes action to advance the project, the City shall notify the regional commission and the state department of community affairs of its action and identify all local requirements it has placed on the development that could mitigate any negative findings identified in the DRI review process.

This section shall not preclude the Planning Commission or its site and design review committee, as applicable, from requiring information waived by the Zoning Administrator if, in its judgment, such information is needed to facilitate review.

                  (a)  Initial pre-application encouraged. Applicants with significant development proposals, such as construction of one or more new buildings, are strongly encouraged but not required to have a pre-application meeting with the Planning Commission to gain preliminary input and to ensure application completeness. The chairperson of the Planning Commission in consultation with the Zoning Administrator will determine for scheduling purposes whether the pre-application meeting will be scheduled before the Planning Commission. During the pre-application meeting, the Planning Commission members may ask questions of the applicant's intent and make suggestions with regard to site configuration, colors, building materials, landscaping, architectural design, and accessory structures, or other matters. Specific directions will be given to the applicant in preparing the application for site and design plan approval. 
                  (b)  Finding of completeness. A finding of completeness by the Zoning Administrator is required to process an application for site and design plan approval. Notice shall be provided to any applicant who has not submitted a complete application, and the notice shall describe the deficiencies that need to be corrected or omitted materials that need to be submitted in order to complete the application. 
                  (c)  Scheduling. As soon as practicable after the application has been determined complete, but not later than ten calendar days from the date the application was certified as complete, the Zoning Administrator shall schedule the application for initial review at the next meeting of the Planning Commission. The Planning Commission shall consider the complete application at its next regularly scheduled meeting if the Planning Commission's next regular meeting is scheduled within 14 calendar days from the date notice of a complete application is submitted by the Zoning Administrator. 
                  (d)  Meeting notice and public comment. Public notice of the meeting shall not be required to be advertised; however, at least 24 hours' notice of the date, time, and place of the meeting at which the application will be heard shall be posted the same as routinely provided for special meetings of the City Council or Planning Commission. The applicant will be notified as soon as the meeting is scheduled to act on the application. At any meeting in which a site and design plan application is considered, the Planning Commission may hear from the applicant and may also invite or permit testimony or questions from the public, but a formal public hearing is not required. 
                  (e)  Consideration. The Planning Commission shall take final action to approve, conditionally approve, or disapprove the application at the meeting the application is originally scheduled, unless the agenda item is continued at a later meeting at the request of the applicant, because of failure of the applicant to be represented, or upon mutual agreement between the Planning Commission and applicant.

                  (a)  In addition to considering each site and design plan application's consistency with the purposes of this article, the Planning Commission, as the case may be, shall review applications and take action based on one or more of the following policies and standards: 
                  (1)  Whether the design is in harmony with the general character of the neighborhood and surrounding area, considering factors such as mass, placement, height, changing land use patterns, and consistency of exterior architectural treatment. 
                  (2)  Whether design components are planned in such a fashion that they are physically and aesthetically related and coordinated with other elements of the project and surrounding environment to ensure visual continuity of design. 
                  (3)  Whether the resulting development and its design will protect adjacent properties from negative visual and functional impacts. 
                  (4)  Whether the design respects historical continuity as an integral part of community life in the City and protects and preserves structures and spaces which provide a significant link with the past. 
                  (5)  Consistency or inconsistency with design criteria specified for the zoning district in which the project is located. (See section 40-288, table 4.3 and section 40-467, table 4.6, for most zoning districts; also see division 16 of article II for the residential infill overlay district as applicable). 
                  (6)  Whether the design meets the transportation needs of the community and supports multi-modal transportation access. 
                  (b)  Specific grounds for disapproval, which shall not be considered limiting, may include character foreign to the area, arresting and spectacular effects, violent contrasts of material, a multiplicity or incongruity of details resulting in a restless and disturbing appearance, and the absence of unity and coherence in composition not in consonance with the density and character of the present structure or surrounding area.

                  (a)  If the application for site and design plan approval is denied, the applicant shall not be granted a development permit, building permit, or certificate of occupancy, as appropriate. The Planning Commission shall specify via the Zoning Administrator in writing to the applicant the reasons for denial. The Planning Commission may suggest alternative courses of action it thinks proper if it denies the application submitted. If he so desires, the applicant may make modifications to the plans and may resubmit the application at any time after doing so. 
                  (b)  If an application is denied by the Planning Commission, or if the conditions of approval are considered by the applicant to be onerous or burdensome, the applicant for site and design plan approval shall have 15 calendar days to file a written appeal of the commission's decision to the City Council. The City Council shall make a decision within 30 calendar days from the date of the meeting the initial appeal was considered unless such time is extended with the approval of the appealing party. Decisions shall be made based on the record presented to the Planning Commission, not on the basis of new information. 
                  (c)  All decisions of the City Council regarding appeals of decisions of the Planning Commission shall be final and shall in all instances be subject to judicial review in the manner prescribed by law. In reviewing a decision of the Planning Commission, the City Council may affirm the Planning Commission's decision, modify it, or remand the matter to the commission for further action. When a decision to approve is made by the City Council on appeal to approve a site and design plan application, the approval shall constitute final site and design plan approval for purposes of this article.

                  ARTICLE XII. - PERMITS AND CERTIFICATES 

                  Sec. 40-841. - Development permit. 
                  (a)  Required. A development permit shall be required for any proposed use of lands or buildings, and before any improvement, grading or alteration of lands or buildings commences to indicate and ensure compliance with all provisions of this chapter and other applicable regulations in this Code. Such development activities include, but are not limited to, clearing and grubbing, grading or land disturbance, and the construction of such improvements as streets, surface parking areas and drives, stormwater drainage facilities, sidewalks, or other structures permanently placed on or in the property. 
                  (b)  Separate requirements for phased applications. If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate development permit shall be required for each phase. 
                  (c)  Application. No person shall conduct any land-disturbing or development activity within the City without first applying for and obtaining a development permit from the Zoning Administrator to perform such activity. 
                  (d)  Application requirements. Applications shall be made in accordance with application requirements specified by the Zoning Administrator and this section. The application shall be checked for completeness at the time of submission. Incomplete applications will not be processed and will be returned to the applicant. All applications for a development permit shall be made to the Zoning Administrator and shall be accompanied by the following: 
                  (1)  Application on the form furnished by the Zoning Administrator. 
                  (2)  A fee as established by resolution of the City Council. 
                  (3)  A copy of the approved preliminary plat, if subdivision is required and preliminary plat approval has been obtained, or an application for preliminary plat approval if required. 
                  (4)  A sufficient number (as approved by the Zoning Administrator) of sets of plans drawn to scale, signed and stamped by one or more qualified professionals who have authority to produce such plans or portions thereof, with addresses and contact information. 
                  (5)  Plans requiring or involving stormwater management facilities shall require the submittal of plans containing information specified in the City stormwater management ordinance (article VI of chapter 36). Approval of a development permit containing information and requirements of article VI of chapter 36 shall constitute approval of the permit required by that chapter. 
                  (6)  Plans involving land within a floodplain or flood hazard area shall require the submittal of plans containing information specified in the city flood damage prevention ordinance (article II of chapter 14). Approval of a development permit containing information and requirements of article II of chapter 14 shall constitute approval of the permit required by that chapter. 
                  (7)  Plans requiring a land disturbance permit shall require the submittal of plans containing information specified in the city soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control ordinance (article III of chapter 14) unless specifically exempted by the Zoning Administrator from the submission of plans in accordance with the article. Approval of a development permit containing information and requirements of article III of chapter 14 shall constitute approval of the permit required by that article, subject to other applicable agency approvals required by the article. 
                  (8)  Plans involving land within a wetland shall require the submittal of plans containing information specified in the city wetlands protection ordinance (article IV of chapter 14). 
                  (9)  Plans shall demonstrate compliance as applicable with the city tree ordinance (chapter 38) as well as Tree Maintenance Guidelines and Standards as applicable. 
                  (10)  For subdivisions or other major developments, Development permit applications shall require the submission of plans and information specified in the city subdivision and land development ordinance (chapter 30) and shall demonstrate compliance therewith. 
                  (e)  Relationship to plat approval. An application for preliminary plat approval, when required by the subdivision and land development ordinance (chapter 30), may be processed independently of, or in conjunction with, an application for issuance of a development permit. Applicants are cautioned, however, that the preliminary plat approval is discretionary with regard to compliance with the comprehensive plan and design requirements, and therefore, proceeding simultaneously with preliminary plat and development permit applications may result in the revision of engineering plans if the layout of the preliminary plat of the proposed subdivision must be modified. 
                  (f)  Relationship to site and design plan review. It is anticipated and expected that applicants will proceed more or less simultaneously in pursuing site and design plan approval as required by article XI of this chapter; however, no development permit shall be approved until site and design plan review, if required, is accomplished. A development permit applicant, if not ready to submit architectural details for buildings or structures, may at his discretion divide the site and design plan review application process into a site application and building application, and seek only the site plan portion of the approval process required by article XI of this chapter, which shall be required to issue a development permit. 
                  (g)  Agency and zoning administrator review. The Zoning Administrator shall forward a copy of the development permit application, including the civil plans and drawings for the project, to other city departments and government agencies or others as appropriate, for their review and comment. The applicant may be required by the Zoning Administrator to secure development approval from other agencies if they are affected by (or have jurisdiction over) the development. Development approval may be required from but is not necessarily limited to the following, as applicable: the City Engineer, the City Street or Public Works Department, the Soil and Water Conservation District with jurisdiction, the county Fire Department, the county Health Department, the county Department of Planning, Development, or Building Inspections, the State Department of Transportation, the State Department of Natural Resources, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
                  (h)  Consolidation and submission of comments to applicant. Upon receipt of comments from other city departments and external agencies as appropriate, the Zoning Administrator shall provide all comments to the applicant for resolution and as appropriate shall indicate on one or more copies of the civil drawings or in writing all comments related to compliance with applicable city regulations and agency requirements. Thereafter, the applicant shall submit revised plans to reflect all such comments. 
                  (i)  Issuance. All development permits shall be issued by the Planning Commission who shall in no case grant any development permit for the use, construction or alteration of any land or building if the land or building as proposed to be used, constructed or altered would be in violation of any of the provisions of this chapter or other applicable regulations of the City. The applicant shall be responsible for compliance with all codes, regulations, and zoning requirements and for the satisfaction of all of the comments of reviewing city departments, external agencies, and the Planning Commission. Although review may have been achieved, if another city department or external agency requires approval or a permit, the owner shall also be responsible for obtaining such approval or permit from all other agencies affected by the project prior to issuance of the development permit by the Planning Commission. 
                  (j)  Denial. If the development permit is denied, the Planning Commission shall state in writing the reason for the denial and the applicant shall be notified of the denial. A record of all development permits shall be kept on file in the office of the Zoning Administrator which shall be a public record. 
                  (k)  Duration of validity. 
                  (1)  A development permit shall expire two years after its issuance, subject to the following provisions: 
                  a.  If the work described in any development permit has not been begun within one year from the date of issuance thereof, the permit shall expire; and 
                  b.  If the work described in any development permit has not been substantially completed within two years of the date of issuance thereof, the permit shall expire. 
                  (2)  Application processes shall begin anew for any expired development permit. 
                  (l)  Suspension or revocation. The development permit may be suspended or revoked by the City, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the permit, upon finding that the holder or his successor in title is not in compliance with the approved development permit or is in violation of any applicable regulations in this Code.

                  Sec. 40-842. - Building permit. 
                  (a)  The Building Inspector is hereby authorized to issue building permits in accordance with all provisions of this chapter and relevant chapters of this Code, but only after the Planning Commission has issued a development permit, or if no development permit is required, after a review of the building permit for compliance with the provisions of this chapter and applicable regulations of the City. 
                  (b)  No building or other structure shall be erected, moved, extended, occupied, or enlarged, or structurally altered, nor shall a building or structure's use be changed, nor shall any excavation, grading, or filling of any lot for the construction of any building or structure be commenced until the Building Inspector has issued a building permit for such work in conformity with the provisions of this chapter and all applicable building and related codes. 
                  (c)  Approval of a building permit shall require an application to the Building Inspector as specified in the minimum standard codes. If the building permit is denied, the Building Inspector shall state in writing the reason for the denial and the applicant shall be notified of the denial. A record of all building permits shall be kept on file in the office of the Building Inspector. 
                  (d)  Any building permit issued shall become invalid unless the work authorized by it shall have been commenced within 180 days of its date of issue, or if the work authorized by it is suspended or abandoned for a period of six months. 
                  (e)  See section 6-4 for applicable provisions with regard to administration and enforcement of building permits and minimum standard codes, including reference to chapter 1 of the International Building Code, which shall govern specific procedures and submission requirements.

                  Sec. 40-843. - Certificate of occupancy. 
                  (a)  A certificate of occupancy issued by the Building Inspector is required in advance of occupancy or use, any building or structure hereafter erected, or a change in the use of an existing building or structure. 
                  (b)  A certificate of occupancy, either for the whole or part of a building or use, shall be issued within 72 hours after the erection or structural alterations of such building, or part, or use established, is completed. A certificate of occupancy shall not be issued unless the proposed use of a building or land conforms to the applicable provisions of this chapter and applicable regulations of the City. 
                  (c)  If the certificate of occupancy is denied, the Building Inspector shall state in writing the reason for the denial and the applicant shall be notified of the denial. A record of all certificates shall be kept on file in the office of the Building Inspector. 
                  (d)  See section 6-4 for applicable provisions with regard to administration and enforcement of certificates of occupancy and minimum standard codes, including reference to chapter 1 of the International Building Code which shall govern specific procedures and submission requirements.

                  ARTICLE XIII. - ACCESS, PARKING AND LOADING 

                  Sec. 40-865. - Purpose and intent. 
                  The multiple purposes of this article are summarized as follows: 
                  (1)  Establish requirements for multi-modal access to development sites, including vehicular, truck service, and pedestrian, as appropriate; 
                  (2)  Establish on site circulation patterns conducive to safe pedestrian as well as vehicular and truck access; 
                  (3)  Establish minimum off-street parking and loading areas in proportion to the need created by each use, but considering reductions for the provision of alternative modes of travel; 
                  (4)  Reduce congestion in the streets and ensure that uses and functions of public right-of-ways are not interrupted; 
                  (5)  Establish certain maximum as well as minimum requirements for parking spaces to reduce development costs and ensure that excess impervious surfaces are not constructed, while providing for exceeding maximums when a demonstrated need exists; 
                  (6)  Promote flexible approaches to the provision of off-street parking, including in some cases, as appropriate, the use of on-street parking, shared parking arrangements, and smaller spaces for compact cars; 
                  (7)  Establish design and improvement specifications for the development of parking lots, loading areas, access aisles, and connections of parking lots to public streets; 
                  (8)  Ensure that parking areas will be compatible with abutting residential zoning districts. 
                  (Code 1997, § 40-1401; Ord. of 2-6-2012, § 1(40-1401)) 
                  Sec. 40-866. - Applicability. 
                  (a)  Except within the Town Center Zoning District (TC) and as otherwise specifically provided in this chapter, this article shall apply to: 
                  (1)  Any new building constructed; 
                  (2)  For new uses or conversions of existing, conforming buildings; 
                  (3)  For enlargements of existing structures; and 
                  (4)  When the occupancy of any building is changed to another use. 
                  (b)  This article shall not be construed so as to require additional parking spaces to be furnished for an existing building which is repaired, altered, maintained, or modernized, where no structural alterations are made and the size of the building is not increased.

                  Sec. 40-867. - Access. 
                  (a)  The entire parcel, rather than simply a particular project, shall be considered in formulating and approving access plans. 
                  (b)  All parking shall be provided with vehicular access to a street. Parking areas shall not thereafter be encroached upon or altered without approval of the Planning Commission. 
                  (c)  Loading areas shall be provided with access to a street or alley. Loading areas shall not thereafter be encroached upon or altered without approval of the Planning Commission. 
                  (d)  Off-street parking and loading spaces shall have access so that their use will not require backing movements or other maneuvering within a street right-of-way. 
                  (e)  There shall be no obstruction of a public sidewalk, including that portion of the sidewalk within a driveway apron, due to parking, loading, or other activity. The City Engineer may require that construction contractors make special provisions for maintaining safe passage along public sidewalks during construction.

                  Sec. 40-868. - Shared driveways and inter-parcel access. 
                  (a)  Applicability. This section shall apply to all new office, commercial, institutional, institutional campus and (if permitted) industrial developments and major building renovations and repaving projects of office, commercial, institutional, and (if permitted) industrial developments. 
                  (b)  Shared driveways. Shared driveways between two parcels along the common property line may be required by the Planning Commission during subdivision plat review or site and design plan approval. In such cases, the subdivider or each property owner shall grant an access easement to facilitate the movement of motor vehicles and pedestrians across the site. 
                  (c)  Inter-parcel access requirements. Inter-parcel access for vehicles between abutting and nearby properties shall be provided so that access to individual properties can be achieved between adjacent and nearby developments as an alternative to forcing all movement onto abutting highways and public roads, unless the Planning Commission during site and design plan approval determines that it is unnecessary to provide interparcel access due to the unlikelihood of patrons traveling among two or more existing or proposed uses on abutting or nearby sites. Where opportunities for shared access have been identified by the Zoning Administrator or Planning Commission, developments must provide shared access with adjoining properties to facilitate frontage roads or driveway connections between parcels. The property owner shall grant an access easement to facilitate the movement of motor vehicles and pedestrians from site to site. 
                  (d)  Locations. The location of vehicular connections across a property line shall be mutually determined and constructed by both property owners. Connection of parking areas for vehicular access shall be provided in the rear portion of the site, as approved by the Planning Commission. In cases where it is not possible to provide the connection in the rear, it may be provided in the front portion of the site. In the case of coordination problems or any factors preventing construction of an inter-parcel connection, the Planning Commission will determine the location of the inter-parcel connection to be constructed by property owners.

                  Sec. 40-869. - Visibility at intersections and driveways. 
                  (a)  No fence, wall, sign, hedge or planting or similar improvement will be permitted to obstruct the sight lines or visibility of motorists or pedestrians at any intersection of public or private streets or at any driveway intersection with a public or private street. For purposes of this section, obstructions shall be defined in terms of height as elevations between 30 inches and 12 feet above any roadway or driveway, as applicable. 
                  (b)  Unless otherwise specified by the Zoning Administrator, the area regulated shall be two triangular areas formed by the street right-of-way lines, or such lines extended, and lines connecting such right-of-way lines at points 25 feet from the intersections of the right-of-way lines. In such cases as right-of-way lines do not exist or cannot be determined, the measurements shall be made from points 15 feet from the centerline of the existing road or ten feet from the existing pavement or roadbed, whichever is greater.

                  Sec. 40-870. - Internal vehicular circulation. 
                  (a)  Efficient and easily recognized vehicular circulation routes within a development are vital and shall be provided. 
                  (b)  Internal vehicle circulation shall be designed or redesigned in a manner that avoids conflicts between through-traffic (i.e., traffic flowing into and out of the site) and local traffic (i.e., traffic through parking areas). 
                  (c)  Interior vehicular circulation shall be provided by: 
                  (1)  Visually orienting the driver with a regular, logical system of interior driveways and roadways; 
                  (2)  Identifying entrance drives with small entry signs; and 
                  (3)  Preventing vehicles from driving across or through designated parking areas by placing raised landscaped dividers or walkways between parking aisles.

                  Sec. 40-871. - Pedestrian facilities internal to site required. 
                  (a)  Required. Internal to each building site, any new development unless exempted from this section shall provide safe routes of pedestrian access between points of departure and destinations, in the form of an internal sidewalk system. Pedestrian access must be provided to individual developments and each establishment within the development. When multiple buildings are proposed on an individual site, they shall be linked with on site pedestrian walkways. 
                  (b)  Connections. The internal sidewalk system shall connect to the public sidewalk system along streets and highways, where it exists or is planned, or where required by the Planning Commission via site and design plan approval. The internal sidewalk system shall also connect to any sidewalk systems on abutting private properties or provide for such connections in their absence. 
                  (c)  Design. Pedestrian ways shall be well defined and take as direct a path as possible. The Planning Commission through site and design review may require that automobile access ways be separated from pedestrian access ways. Pedestrians shall in any event have the right-of-way over automobile travel within interior portions of development sites. 
                  (d)  Crossings. On any particular development site subject to this section, where pedestrian circulation crosses vehicular routes, a change in grade, materials, textures or colors, or appropriate striping or demarcation, shall be provided to emphasize the point of intersection between pedestrians and vehicles and improve its visibility and safety. For instance, brick pavers and other special paving materials can help to distinguish pedestrian walkway surfaces from vehicular access ways. 
                  (e)  Width specifications. All walkways internal to the site shall be a minimum of five feet wide, except for walkways serving individual single-family residences, which shall be a minimum of three feet wide. 
                  (f)  Applicability and exemption. This section shall not apply to the construction of any detached, single-family residence on an individual lot, but it shall apply to any lot that is contained within a final subdivision plat approved under chapter 30 and to any lots that are a part of a larger development which received site and design plan approval and which required sidewalks internal to each single-family lot.

                  Sec. 40-873. - Location of off-street parking areas. 
                  (a)  Requirement. All parking spaces required by this article shall be provided on the same lot with the main building or use which it serves, except as specifically provided in this section or as otherwise provided in the TC, Town Center zoning district or in accepted future development plans in Institutional Campus Districts. 
                  (b)  Exemption. The Planning Commission may permit some or all of the required parking spaces to be provided on another lot, a substantial portion of which must be within 800 feet of such building, structure, or use. Any applicant proposing to use off-street parking on another site to meet the on site parking requirements of this article shall submit evidence either of ownership or a valid agreement to lease the parking area off-site. Safe and convenient pedestrian access, such as a sidewalk or path, must exist or be provided from the structure or use to the off-site parking lot.

                  (a)  Before any parking lot or other parking improvement is constructed, or building permit is issued, the parking lot layout and area must be found by the Zoning Administrator to be in compliance with all requirements of this article and a parking plan must be approved by the Planning Commission via the site and design plan approval process (see article XI of this chapter). 
                  (b)  No permit shall be issued for any parking area until the plans and specifications have been submitted for review by the Zoning Administrator and site and design plan approval has been given by the Planning Commission. Such plans and specifications shall include the number of spaces provided and required, the location of entrances, exits, aisles, curbing where required, landscaping, screening, surface materials, and provisions for drainage. 
                  (c)  The Building Official shall not allow occupancy or use of a building until advised by the Zoning Administrator that parking facilities meet the requirements of this article.

                  The following minimum design requirements shall be adhered to and demonstrated with the submission of appropriate plans and specifications during the site and design plan approval process (article XI of this chapter) and development permitting (article XII of this chapter): 
                  (1)  Paving; variations. Parking and loading areas shall be paved with concrete, asphaltic concrete or asphalt, unless the Planning Commission via the site and design plan approval process (see article XI of this chapter) specifically approves another dust-free surface material be substituted in lieu of such paving. Porous pavement parking spaces and grass pavers may be substituted for standard dust free pavements subject to the approval of the City Engineer. Aggregate (gravel) surface may be considered appropriate in agricultural and rural areas. Water quality considerations and the character of the district in which the parking lot is proposed to be constructed may be considered by the Planning Commission in modifying parking lot pavement requirements during the required site and design approval process. 
                  (2)  Curbing and drainage. Parking and loading areas shall be properly graded if necessary but in all cases drained so as to prevent damage to abutting properties or public streets. Water quality effectiveness and character of the zoning district shall be considerations in determining curbing requirements by the Planning Commission via the site and design approval process (see article XI of this chapter). 
                  (3)  Circulation. Dead-end parking areas shall be prohibited unless design conditions prevent a connected design, and they can only be used if 90-degree parking design is used. 
                  (4)  Minimum parking space width. Off-street parking spaces shall be a minimum of ten feet in width. 
                  (5)  Minimum parking space length. Off-street parking spaces shall be a minimum of 20 feet in length except where compact parking is authorized by the Zoning Administrator, in which case parking space lengths can be reduced to 16 feet. 
                  (6)  Minimum aisle length. Parking driveway maneuvering aisle width requirements vary according to the width and length of parking spaces and the angle of parking. For a single row of 90-degree head-in parking, the minimum depth for a parking space plus the width of the aisle shall be 42 feet. For two rows of 90-degree head-in parking using the same aisle, the minimum depth for parking spaces plus the width of the aisle shall be 60 feet for ten-foot wide spaces (measured from back of curb to back of curb). 
                  (7)  Compact auto parking. Compact parking spaces may be used in parking areas when more than 20 parking spaces are required, provided that the areas for compact parking are clearly marked and not more than 20 percent of the number of parking spaces provided in the entire parking area is designated compact auto parking. 
                  (8)  Angled parking. The Planning Commission may authorize parking lot designs that utilize 75-, 60-, and 45-degree-angled parking spaces with one-way or two-way aisles. If such angled parking is used, parking lots shall comply with acceptable parking dimensional standards for aisle widths as specified by the Institute of Transportation Engineers or other reputable source approved by the Planning Commission. 
                  (9)  Maximum aisle length. Parking aisle length shall not exceed 100 feet without a break for circulation. 
                  (10)  Landscaped divider. One landscaped divider (i.e., planted area within in between and separating the vehicle parking spaces fronting one another) with a minimum width of nine feet shall be provided for every third parking aisle in a parking lot; provided, however, that the Planning Commission may vary this requirement via the site and design plan approval process in cases of short parking aisles or where alternative designs prevent random maneuvers which can endanger pedestrians. 
                  (11)  Lighting. Parking areas shall be appropriately lighted unless the Planning Commission via site and design plan approval determines that lighting would be incompatible with abutting properties. Lighting shall not create safety hazard, public nuisance, or other forms of light pollution, and shall minimize impact on natural darkness beyond the perimeter and above the site. Where lighting of parking lots is required or provided, light poles should be located in landscaped planter strips. Where this cannot be accomplished, light poles must be placed on a reinforced concrete pedestal to protect them from damage or being knocked over. 
                  (12)  Landscaping. Parking lots shall meet the requirements for parking lot landscaping as specified in the city tree ordinance (chapter 38), as well as tree maintenance guidelines and standards, as applicable. 
                  (13)  Signage. Where needed to promote proper circulation within off-street parking areas, directional signs shall be placed in appropriate locations as specified by the Planning Commission via site and design plan approval or the Zoning Administrator via development permit approval or parking plan approval.

                  Sec. 40-876. - Minimum and maximum on site parking spaces. 
                  (a)  Unless specifically provided otherwise in this article, on each lot where a building, structure, or use exists, each site shall be designed to provide and shall provide for off-street parking in the minimum (and not to exceed the maximum) amounts in table 40.1. 
                  (b)  No existing or future off-street parking area shall be reduced in capacity to less than the minimum required number of spaces, or increased to more than the maximum permitted number of spaces, or altered in design or function to less than the minimum standards, unless specifically provided for in this article. Parking lots that are removed for a use other than parking shall be replaced to meet the required parking spaces for that use. 
                  (c)  This section shall not be construed as requiring compliance of parking lots which lawfully existed on the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived; provided, however, that the Planning Commission shall ensure parking lots that do not comply with this article meet the requirements of this article or substantially comply when a new development permit is required or a building permit is required to add additional building space on the site. If substantial redesign of the parking lot is required to comply with this article in such cases of new development or building additions, the Planning Commission may accept substantial rather than complete compliance when the strict application of a requirement of this article would pose substantial practical difficulty. 
                  TABLE 40.1. MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM NUMBER OF OFF-STREET  PARKING SPACES REQUIRED 
                  Unless otherwise noted, the parking requirement shall be based on the gross square footage of the building or buildings devoted to the particular use specified.

                  Sec. 40-877. - Interpretations. 
                  (a)  Fractions. Where a fractional space results during the calculation of required parking, the required number of parking spaces shall be construed to be the next highest whole number. 
                  (b)  Parking space requirement not specified. Where the parking requirement for a particular use is not described in table 40.1 (section 40-876), and where no similar use is listed, the Planning Commission shall determine the number of spaces to be provided based on requirements for similar uses, location of the proposed use, the number of employees on the largest shift, total square footage, potential customer use, and other expected demand and traffic generated by the proposed use. At the discretion of a development applicant, a parking generation study prepared by a qualified professional may be submitted to aid the Planning Commission in making such a determination; if submitted, it shall be considered by the Planning Commission prior to making a determination. 
                  (c)  Computations for multiple floor uses within a building. In cases where a building contains some combination of residential use, office space, retail or wholesale sales area, or bulk storage area, the Planning Commission may authorize that the building space be divided into such floor space use areas and separate computations of floor areas (e.g., warehousing, retail, or office) in determining the off-street parking or loading space requirements of this article.

                  As provided in section 40-873, off-site, off-street parking may be used in combination to meet minimum parking space requirements; a reduction of required on site, off-street parking spaces on a given site may be permitted by the Planning Commission in cases where additional off-street, off-site, parking area in sufficient quantity and availability in conformity with this article compensates for the reduction. 
                  (Code 1997, § 40-1415; Ord. of 2-6-2012, § 1(40-1415)) 
                  Sec. 40-880. - Reduction for mixed or joint use of parking spaces. 
                  When more than one use is provided on a lot, and such uses operate more or less simultaneously, the total requirements for off-street parking spaces shall be the sum of the requirements for the various uses computed separately. The Planning Commission may authorize a reduction in the total number of required off-street parking spaces for two or more uses jointly providing parking facilities when their respective hours of need of maximum parking do not normally overlap, provided that the developer submits sufficient data to demonstrate that the hours of maximum demand for parking at the respective uses do not normally overlap. The required spaces assigned to one use may not be assigned to another use at the same time, except that one-half of the parking spaces required for churches, theaters or assembly halls whose peak attendance will be at night or on Sundays may be assigned to a use which will be closed at night or on Sundays.

                  ARTICLE XIV. - BUFFERS AND SCREENING 

                  Sec. 40-898. - Purpose. 
                  Buffer and screening requirements for nonresidential land uses are established to benefit the environmental and aesthetic quality of the City. The intent of this article is to promote preservation of the city's natural resources and to facilitate their growth in a way that will provide a healthy environment for the city's future. Buffering and screening requirements are also intended to prevent or mitigate land use conflicts between adjacent residential and nonresidential land uses. 
                  (Ord. of 12-5-2011, § 37-101) 
                  Sec. 40-899. - Screening buffer required. 
                  For nonresidential land uses, a planted or natural buffer strip is required to protect residential land uses from negative impacts such as litter, dust, wind, light, noise, unsightly views, and other characteristics commonly associated with nonresidential land uses and related vehicular and pedestrian traffic that adversely impact the quality of residential life. The required buffer provides necessary visual and acoustical privacy and assists in the protection and preservation of property values. Required buffer strips shall be established and maintained by the owner of the nonresidential property. 
                  (Ord. of 12-5-2011, § 37-102) 
                  Sec. 40-900. - Minimum specifications for buffer widths. 
                  (a)  All buffer areas and screening shall be established in accordance with the following requirements: 
                  (1)  In the event the buffer includes a utility or pipeline easement, a minimum buffer of no less than 20 feet in width will be required outside the easement. In no case will the buffer be less than 20 feet except as may be permitted in the table included in this section. 
                  (2)  Screening shall be established within any buffer along the entire length of the side and rear lot lines; provided, however, that this screening requirement may be adjusted to observe the site distance required in the development regulations or as a condition of zoning, special use, or variance approval or as approved by the Zoning Administrator. 
                  (3)  The solid fencing and landscaping buffer requirements of this article shall be installed prior to the construction of any buildings or structures. 
                  (4)  The required buffer strip may be included in the minimum yard area applicable to the zoning district in which the strip is located. 
                  (b)  The following table provides the minimum buffer specifications required for each nonresidential zoning district in relation to adjacent residential districts:

                  Sec. 40-902. - Fences. 
                  Fences within required buffer strips shall meet the following requirements: 
                  (1)  Fences shall be constructed of durable materials. Use of cyclone fencing that utilizes inserts as screening is prohibited. 
                  (2)  Painted or stained wood shall be maintained, and metal fencing shall be painted or vinyl-coated. 
                  (3)  Fence supports shall face inward, and posts shall be anchored in concrete. Fences may step down a slope, but supports must remain vertical and plumb. 
                  (4)  A minimum of four inches shall be clear under wood fencing.

                  (b)  In nonresidential districts, a five-foot wide landscape strip, or an eight-foot-high solid enclosure of the same or similar materials as the front facade of the primary structure shall be required to surround three sides of any accessory use. Assuming the accessory use has four sides, the side not screened shall not be visible from a public street if practicable. The Zoning Administrator may reduce the number of sides for which the landscape strip or solid enclosure is required, provided he determines that such a reduction will still allow for the achievement of the intent of this article.

                  (Code 1997, § 40-1503; Ord. of 2-6-2012, § 1(40-1503)) 
                  Sec. 40-928. - Measurement of signs. 
                  The sign area is calculated by determining the number of square feet of the smallest rectangles within which a sign face can be enclosed. In determining the area of an individual sign that has more than one face (e.g., a monument or projecting sign), the single sign face with the greatest area shall be used. The total sign area is the sum of all individual sign areas. The height of a sign shall be measured from the ground, adjacent to the sign, to the top of the sign and support structure. If the ground under the sign slopes, the height shall be measured from the average grade under the sign itself. 
                  (Code 1997, § 40-1504; Ord. of 2-6-2012, § 1(40-1504)) 
                  Sec. 40-929. - Height of signs. 
                  The maximum height of any sign is 15 feet above the adjacent grade. A sign may not be located above the highest point of the second story of any building, unless an exception is approved by the Planning Commission. All signs that are attached to a building must be located on a building face that has a public entrance. The Planning Commission may make exceptions to this requirement in circumstances where the purpose and intent of these regulations is maintained and where the orientation of the public entrance to a building is such that the sign would not have sufficient visibility from the public right-of-way to provide for adequate identification of the business or use.

                  Sec. 40-930. - Setbacks. 
                  Except as otherwise provided in this article, the location of signs shall conform with build-to lines or setbacks established in the zoning regulations. 
                  (1)  With the Planning Commission's approval, traffic directional signs may be placed in the required setback, provided they do not interfere with visibility required for safe vehicular and pedestrian circulation, especially at street corners. 
                  (2)  With the Planning Commission's approval, monument signs may be located in the required setback area, provided they are outside of the visibility triangle, provide adequate sight distance for driveways and meet applicable height and area limits established for the zoning district. 
                  (3)  The Planning Commission may approve reduced setbacks for signs that they review, provided the sign does not interfere with visibility required for safe vehicular and pedestrian circulation and provided that the sign is architecturally compatible with the proposed location.

                  Sec. 40-931. - Illumination. 
                  Where illumination of signs is permitted, the following standards shall apply: 
                  (1)  Lighting for signs shall not create a hazardous glare for pedestrians or vehicles either in a public street or on any private premises. 
                  (2)  The light source, whether internal to the sign or external, shall be shielded from view. This requirement is not intended to preclude the use of diffused exposed neon. 
                  (3)  Sign illumination for externally illuminated signs shall utilize focused light fixtures that do not allow light or glare to shine above the horizontal plane of the top of the sign or onto any public right-of-way or adjoining property. 
                  (4)  Signs shall not be illuminated after 10:00 p.m. or close of business, whichever is later, unless specifically permitted by the Planning Commission. Signs that may warrant exception to this standard may include institutional signs used to identify the location beyond normal business hours (e.g., City Hall, Oxford College), or city limit signs erected and maintained by the City, provided the signs do not create a hazardous glare for pedestrians or vehicles, either in a public street or on any private premises, as stated in subsection (1) of this section. 
                  (5)  Each sign shall be designed so that illumination does not exceed 100 luxes (ten foot-candles) measured at a distance of ten feet from the sign. 
                  (6)  Signs located in residential zones may not be illuminated, except directory signs, which shall not exceed ten luxes (one foot-candle) measured at a distance of ten feet from the sign.

                  Sec. 40-932. - Sign standards by districts. 
                  The following standards shall be applied in each of the City's zoning districts, notwithstanding the standards for each sign type established in section 40-933: 
                  TABLE 2. SIGN STANDARDS BY DISTRICT 

                   
                  (Code 1997, § 40-1508; Ord. of 2-6-2012, § 1(40-1508)) 
                  Sec. 40-933. - Types of signs. 
                  (a)  Wall signs. Wall signs include most types of signage that are attached to the face of a building wall. These include channel letters made out of wood, metal or plastic. Wall signs may be painted on a wall, or on a board that is attached to a wall. Wall signs should be oriented to achieve balanced composition and harmony with other architectural elements of a building facade. Wall signs should be placed on a flat building surface and should not be placed over or otherwise obscure architectural building features. 
                  (1)  Location and number permitted. Wall signs must be located on a building face that has a public entrance. The maximum number of wall signs permitted is two per tenant space. 
                  (2)  Size. Wall signs may be a maximum of 50 square feet or 15 percent of the building face where the sign is attached, whichever is less. Wall signs with changeable copy are limited to six square feet. 
                  (3)  Illumination. Wall signs may be illuminated by any means consistent with section 40-931. 
                  (b)  Window signs. Window signs should be scaled to the pedestrian and oriented to window shoppers on the sidewalk, as opposed to vehicles passing by. Window signs should be limited to small graphics and text that serve to frame a window or to provide information. A window sign should not obscure the view into a store or place of business. 
                  (1)  Location and number permitted. There is no specific location requirement or limit to the number of window signs allowed. A window sign is a sign that is painted on or attached to a window and located within 12 inches of the face of a window. Window signs do not include business hours of operation or open/closed signs. Window displays, including merchandise displays, graphics and text, that are located more than 12 inches from the face of a window are not considered signs. 
                  (2)  Size. Window signs are limited to a maximum of 24 square feet. Window signs shall not exceed 20 percent of any individual window and 50 percent of glass panes of any door. 
                  (3)  Illumination. Window signs may be illuminated by any means consistent with section 40-931. 
                  (c)  Projecting signs. Projecting signs are attached to a building face and project out perpendicular to the building wall. Projecting signs are very effective when oriented to pedestrians on the sidewalk level. Appropriate materials include wood and metal with carved or applied lettering, or any other material that is architecturally compatible with the building that the sign is attached to. Multiple projecting signs should not be installed within ten feet of each other if on the same property and should be separated from projecting signs on adjacent properties by ten feet to ensure proper visibility. 

                  (1)  Location and number permitted. Projecting signs must be attached to building facades that have a public entrance and must maintain a minimum clearance of eight feet above the public right-of-way or private sidewalk area. One projecting sign is allowed per tenant space. 
                  (2)  Size. Projecting signs may have a maximum area of six square feet. 
                  (3)  Illumination. Projecting signs may be illuminated by any means consistent with section 40-931. 
                  (d)  Awning signs. Signs on awnings are appropriate if there are no good alternatives for wall signs, projecting signs or hanging and suspended signs. Signage should be limited to the skirt of the awning and should not be on the awning face. Signs should only be considered for the awning face if there is no other adequate location for signage on a given storefront or property. 
                  (1)  Location and number permitted. Signs may be located on awnings subject to size criteria. One awning sign is permitted per tenant space and must maintain a minimum clearance of eight feet above any public right-of-way or private sidewalk area. 
                  (2)  Size . Signs on awnings shall not cover more than 25 percent of the main area of the awning, or exceed 25 square feet in size, whichever is smaller. 
                  (3)  Illumination. Awning signs may be illuminated by any means consistent with section 40-931. 
                  (e)  Monument signs. Monument signs are typically used where building setbacks, orientation or design make it difficult to provide other types of signage, such as wall signs, that are plainly visible to people that are trying to identify a use. Monument signs have a solid base that the sign face is installed upon. These signs should be designed so that the style of the sign and its base are consistent with the architecture of the buildings on the site. They are typically oriented perpendicular to the adjacent street and sidewalk and have a maximum of two parallel sign faces. Monument signs provide opportunities for landscaping to enhance their appearance. 

                  (1)  Location and number permitted. Monument signs may be located in required street yards for any given zoning district, subject to the approval of the Planning Commission. Only one monument sign is permitted per premises, per street frontage. 
                  (2)  Size. Monument signs may be a maximum of 24 square feet. The maximum height of a monument sign is six feet. In the town center district, the maximum size of a monument sign is 12 square feet and the maximum height is four feet. Where two or more uses are located on the same premises, the sign area for monument signs must be shared. The largest single sign face is used to calculate the area of monument signs. 
                  (3)  Illumination. If illumination of monument signs is desired, then external illumination or halo lighting is preferred. Internally-illuminated cabinet signs must have a dark background with light lettering, per requirements set forth in section 40-931. 
                  (4)  Design. The color of the base and the materials enclosing the base of a monument sign shall be consistent with the exterior color and materials of the buildings on the property. Monument signs having a base greater than 18 inches in height shall have a base that is constructed of the same materials and incorporates the same colors as the principle structures on the property. Monument sign bases that are 18 inches or less in height may have a base constructed of the same material as the exterior of the sign cabinet. Landscaping shall be installed around the base of the monument sign. 
                  (f)  Freestanding post signs. Freestanding post signs are primarily used to identify office uses, especially where a former residence has been converted into an office or commercial use. They are similar to monument signs, except they do not have a base other than the support posts, they usually have a single sign face, and they are usually oriented parallel to the sidewalk instead of perpendicular. The colors and materials used for the sign must be compatible with the associated building design. Lettering should be carved, routed or applied as opposed to painted on a flat board. 

                  (1)  Location and number permitted. Freestanding post signs may be located in required street yards for any given zone, subject to the approval of the Planning Commission, as provided for in section 40-930. Only one freestanding post sign is permitted per premises, per street frontage. 
                  (2)  Size. The maximum sign area for freestanding post signs is 15 square feet. Freestanding post signs shall not be taller than five feet, measured from the ground to the top of the sign structure. Where two or more uses are located on the same premises, the sign area for freestanding post signs must be shared. 
                  (3)  Illumination. Freestanding post signs may be externally illuminated consistent with section 40-931. 
                  (g)  Directory signs. Directory signs are used for multi-tenant buildings to provide a directory of tenant locations within the building. They may also serve as the address sign for the property. Directory signs are small scale and are oriented to pedestrians. 
                  (1)  Location and number. Directory signs may be freestanding, or may be fixed on an exterior wall if the building has no setback. One directory sign may be permitted per premises. 
                  (2)  Size. Directory signs may be no larger than 12 square feet in area, and individual letters may not exceed six inches in height. 
                  (3)  Illumination. Directory signs may be illuminated by any means consistent with section 40-931. 
                  (h)  Electronic message center signs. Electronic message centers (EMCs) come in different shapes and sizes and typically have informational messages. Any messages shall consist of text which may change but shall not flash or scroll across the screen. 
                  (1)  Location and number. EMCs may be incorporated into a monument-style sign. One EMC is permitted per premises. 
                  (2)  Size. The electronic message center may only constitute ten percent of the overall sign area. 
                  (3)  Illumination. EMCs may be illuminated using amber lighting and shall be consistent with section 40-931. 
                  (4)  Zoning. EMCs may be located in institutional or institutional campus districts only. 
                  (i)  Residential subdivision signs. The purpose of residential subdivision signs is to identify the name of a subdivision, provided the subdivision is not an in-fill project within an established neighborhood. They are usually monument signs or wall signs placed on a wall feature in a landscaped open space area at the entry of the development. 
                  (1)  Location and number. One residential subdivision sign is allowed at each major street frontage of a subdivision. They must be located within a landscaped area that is maintained by a homeowners' association. 
                  (2)  Size. Each sign may be up to 20 square feet and have a maximum height of four feet. 
                  (3)  Illumination. Residential subdivision signs may be externally illuminated consistent with section 40-931. 
                  (4)  Zoning. Residential subdivision signs are allowed in all residential zones, subject to the approval of the Planning Commission. 
                  (j)  Sandwich board signs. Sandwich-board signs can be effective for certain types of uses, such as markets, restaurants or bakeries that have changing specials and menus. These signs may have re-writable surfaces, such as chalk boards or dry-erase boards. 
                  (1)  Location and number. Sandwich-board signs must be placed on private property, except in the town center district. Signs shall not be located in parking areas or in roadways. Only one sandwich board sign is permitted per tenant space. Signs shall be located in front of the building entrance only, with location to be approved by the Planning Commission. There must be a five-foot distance to pass between the sign and building or an immobile street amenity such as benches, bike racks, trees, post boxes, stairs, etc., as the sign can become a hazard to the public right-of-way. 
                  (2)  Size. Sandwich board signs may have a maximum area of six square feet and a maximum height of four feet, measured from the ground to the top of the sign. 
                  (3)  Illumination. Sandwich board signs may not be illuminated.

                  Sec. 40-934. - Temporary and special event signs. 
                  (a)  Temporary signs. Temporary signs may be erected and maintained in the City only in accordance with the following provisions: 
                  (1)  Temporary business signs and temporary event signs shall require a temporary sign permit from the Zoning Administrator, except for those signs regulated in section 8-124 (e.g., yard sales, vehicle sales, bazaars, etc., which require notification but not permitting). Temporary off-site subdivision signs (permitted only for subdivisions within city limits) shall require approval and a sign permit from the Zoning Administrator. Temporary political, real estate, subdivision and construction signs shall be exempt from temporary sign permit procedures provided all applicable requirements set forth herein are met. 
                  (2)  The Zoning Administrator shall impose as a condition of approval such requirements as to the material, manner of construction, and method of erection of a sign as are reasonably necessary to ensure the health, safety, welfare, aesthetics, and convenience of the public. 
                  (b)  Temporary business signs. Temporary business signs are signs identifying a special, unique, or limited activity, service, product, or sale of limited duration. Temporary business signs shall be subject to the following: 
                  (1)  Number. There shall not be more than three permits for temporary business signs issued for the same business location within one calendar year. 
                  (2)  Type of sign. Temporary business signs may include wall signs, freestanding signs, and banners. 
                  (3)  Sign area. Temporary business signs shall not exceed 24 square feet in gross surface area. 
                  (4)  Location. Temporary business signs shall be located only upon the zoning lot upon which the special, unique, or limited activity, service product, or sale is to occur. Such signs may be located in any yard or required yard (i.e., setback area between the building and property line), but shall not extend over any lot line. 
                  (5)  Height. Temporary business signs shall not project higher than 15 feet. 
                  (6)  Special conditions. Temporary business signs shall be erected and maintained for a period not to exceed ten consecutive days, and shall be removed within three days of the termination of the activity, service, project, or sale. The determination as to whether such special, unique, or limited activity, service, product, or sale of limited duration qualifies for a temporary business sign permit shall be at the discretion of the Planning Commission. 
                  (c)  Temporary event signs. Temporary event signs may announce a campaign, drive, activity, or event of a civic, philanthropic, educational, or religious organization for non-commercial purposes. Temporary event signs may include wall signs, freestanding signs, banners, pennants and streamers.

                  (a)  Replacement. A nonconforming sign shall not be replaced by another nonconforming sign, except that the substitution or interchange of poster panels, painted boards or dismountable material on nonconforming signs shall be permitted. 
                  (b)  Repairs and maintenance. No structural repairs, change in shape, or size of a nonconforming sign shall be permitted except to make the sign comply with the requirements of this article. Minor repairs and maintenance of nonconforming signs shall be permitted. 
                  (c)  Duration and continuance. Signs which did not meet all requirements of this article when erected, or which do not meet provisions of this article at the time of its amendment, may stay in place until one of the following conditions occurs: 
                  (1)  No structural changes to the support structure or changes to the sign face itself except message changes which do not renew or extend the life of the sign shall be allowed. 
                  (2)  Maintenance to nonconforming signs shall be limited to painting and repair of the existing sign. 
                  (3)  Once a nonconforming sign is removed, taken down, or destroyed (i.e., receiving damage to an extent of more than 50 percent of the replacement cost at the time of destruction), such sign shall not be replaced with another sign unless such sign is in conformance with this article. Such damaged sign shall not be expanded or relocated. Such sign shall not be reconstructed or moved without complying in all respects with the provisions of this article. 
                  (d)  Signs within right-of-way. Notwithstanding the prohibitions in section 40-936(a)(8), the Planning Commission may, upon recommendation of the Zoning Administrator, permit signs, otherwise permitted by this chapter, within the street or highway right-of-way.

                  (a)  Notice and warning. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in any activity inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter, with an approved plan or permit, or with conditions of a permit, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the date upon which such measures must be completed, which shall be no fewer than five days from the issuance of the written notice. This written notice to comply shall serve as a written warning to the violator. If the person engaged in the unlawful activity fails to comply by the date specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this chapter. 
                  (b)  Stop-work order. If the violation is not corrected within the time frame provided in the notice, the Zoning Administrator, designee, or other authorized enforcement officer shall issue a stop-work order requiring that such unlawful activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred.

                  (c)  Service of notices, warnings, and stop-work orders. Any notices, warnings or stop-work orders shall be deemed served upon the posting of the same in the permit box, if any, at the location where the activity is or was taking place. It is the responsibility of the permittee to monitor and check the permit box for material issued pursuant to this chapter. If the violation is by a tenant, person, corporation, firm, or other entity who is not the owner of record of the building, structure, or land, the Zoning Administrator or designee shall provide written notice, either personally or by mail, to the owner of record of such building, structure, or land. If the owner of record does not bring the use of the building, structure, or land into compliance within the time specified in the notice, warning, or stop-work order, the owner shall be considered to be in violation of the provisions of this chapter. 
                  (d)  Citation or injunction. If the violation is not corrected within the time frame provided in the notice, the Zoning Administrator, designee, or other authorized enforcement officer may issue a citation for violation of this chapter or other provision of this Code, requiring the presence of the violator in the Municipal Court or other court with jurisdiction. The Zoning Administrator may also institute an injunction, or institute other appropriate action or proceeding to prevent or abate such violation or to prevent the continuance of use or the occupancy of such building, structure, or land. 
                  (e)  Suspension or revocation of permit or other authorization.

                  (f)  Suspension or revocation of other approvals. As an additional remedy, the Zoning Administrator, designee, or other enforcement office may refuse or deny all city permits, licenses, certificates, utility connection authorization, and applications to the owner or his agents until such violation is abated or corrected.
