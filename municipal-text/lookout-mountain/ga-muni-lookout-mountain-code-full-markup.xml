PREFACE 
</p>
        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Lookout Mountain, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1969 Code and ordinances adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1969 Code and any ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is numbered 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time, new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross-references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Senior Code Attorney, Code Attorney, and Rebecca D. Evans, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Cindy Roberts, City Clerk, Mr. William H. Pickering, City Attorney and Ms. Debbie Croxton, Mr. Pickering's assistant, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

         <div type="charter">
            <p>PART I - CHARTER[1]                   An Act to incorporate the City of Lookout Mountain, Georgia; to define certain works; to provide for corporate limits; to provide for corporate powers; to provide for a city council and election of councilmen; to provide for a mayor and election of a mayor; to provide for the qualifications of the mayor and councilmen; to provide for the meetings of the city council; to provide that the mayor will preside at meetings of the council; to provide for a vice-mayor; to provide for the filling of vacancies in office of the mayor or councilmen; to provide for the appointment of a city clerk by the mayor; to provide for an official city newspaper; to provide for city legislation and the procedure related thereto; to provide that the council may authorize officers and agencies of the city to promulgate rules and regulations; to provide for the administrative duties of the mayor; to provide that the mayor shall appoint a city attorney and such assistant city attorneys as may be authorized by ordinances; to provide for the establishment of a municipal court; to provide for jurisdiction and powers of the municipal court; to provide for a judge of the municipal court; to provide for the salary and the removal of said judge; to provide for an acting municipal judge; to provide that the council may, by ordinance, establish departments, agencies and offices; to provide for the appointment, suspension and removal of the chiefs of the fire department and police department; to provide for an oath of office; to provide for an official bond; to provide that officers and employees shall not profit from connections with the city; to provide for a fiscal year; to provide that the mayor shall submit an annual budget; to provide for public hearings; to provide for action by the council on the budget; to provide for centralized purchasing by the city purchasing agent; to provide for the sale of city property by the mayor; to provide for an annual audit; to provide for property taxes; to provide for a tax levy; to provide for tax due dates and tax bills; to provide for the collection of delinquent taxes; to provide for an official depository of the city's funds; to provide for restrictions on actions for damages against the city; to provide for the transfer of certain assets and the assumption of certain liabilities; to provide that general laws may be used in lieu of the provisions of this Act; to provide a severability clause; to provide for a referendum; to repeal conflicting laws; and for other purposes.

                  Footnotes: 
                  --- (1) --- 
                  Editor's note— Printed herein is the city Charter, being 1968 Ga. Laws (Act No. 687), page 2152. Amendments are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision derives unchanged from the original. Obvious misspellings have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes, a uniform system of headings and catchlines has been used. Material in brackets [ ] has been added for clarity. As O.C.G.A. § 36-32-1 renames the court the municipal court, the term "city court" is changed to "municipal court" and the term "city judge" is changed to "municipal judge."

At the end of each quarter of the fiscal year, the mayor shall submit a detailed budget report to the council, showing estimated and actual receipts and expenditures or encumbrances for that quarter and the fiscal year to the end of that quarter, as well as the amount encumbered or expended in excess of any of the itemized estimates of expenditures supporting the appropriations.

The city council, by ordinance, shall use the assessments set by Walker County, Georgia, for all properties within the city located in said county. In [the] event any area within Dade County, Georgia shall come to be within the corporate limits of said city, the city council shall, by ordinance, establish a Board of Tax Equalization of said city, consisting of three (3) members, one of whom shall be a resident of Dade County and an owner of property within the Dade County portion of the city, one of whom shall be a resident of Walker County and an owner of property in the portion of the city located in Walker County, and the third of whom shall be a person, not necessarily a resident of Georgia, well qualified to value real estate, who shall be impartial and who shall meet with the approval of the other two members of said board. The terms of the members of said board shall not exceed two (2) years and, before taking office, they shall take, in addition to the oath of office provided in the Act incorporating said city, an oath to administer their duties impartially between the citizens of said city owning property in Walker County and those owning property in Dade County.

In making its determination, the municipal planning commission shall examine the building permit application papers and, if the commission deems it advisable, review the site of the structure or proposed structure. The provisions of this article shall not apply to, and the municipal planning commission shall not be required to examine, applications for a building permit for alterations or repairs not affecting the outward appearance of a structure.

                  Sec. 8-123. - Abatement procedure. 
                  The city council, having found that there exist within the city dwellings, buildings, or structures which are unfit for human habitation or for commercial, industrial, or business uses, and private property within the city where an accumulation of weeds, trash, junk, filth, and other unsanitary or unsafe conditions create a health hazard or a general nuisance to the persons residing within the city, the city council hereby adopts the provisions of O.C.G.A. §§ 41-2-7 through 41-2-17, as follows: 
                  (1)  The definitions contained in O.C.G.A. § 41-2-8 are incorporated by reference herein, and shall be included as a part of this article. 
                  (2)  There is hereby created the office, within the city, designated as nuisance hearing officer. Such officer shall be the chairperson of the municipal planning commission of the city or such other individual as the mayor may designate. The nuisance hearing officer shall be uncompensated, and shall serve at the pleasure of the city council. Such officer shall be empowered with all the powers and authority authorized under the provisions of O.C.G.A. §§ 41-2-7 through 41-2-17. 
                  (3)  Whenever a request is filed with the nuisance hearing officer by a public authority or by at least five residents of the city charging that any dwelling, building, structure, or property is unfit for human habitation or for commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes, is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes, or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the nuisance hearing officer shall make an investigation or inspection of the specific dwelling, building, structure, or property. If the officer's investigation or inspection identifies that any dwelling, building, structure, or property is unfit for human habitation or for commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions the officer may issue a complaint in rem against the lot, tract, or parcel of real property on which such dwelling, building, or structure is situated or where such public health hazard or general nuisance exists, and shall cause summons and a copy of the complaint to be served on the interested parties for such dwelling, building, or structure. The complaint shall identify the subject real property by appropriate street address and official tax map reference; identify the interested parties; state with particularity the factual basis for the action; and contain a statement of the action sought by the nuisance hearing officer to abate the alleged nuisance. The summons shall notify the interested parties that a hearing will be held before the municipal court, at a date and time certain. Such hearing shall be held not less than 15 days nor more than 45 days after the filing of said complaint in the municipal court. The interested parties shall have the right to file an answer to the complaint and to appear in person or by attorney and offer testimony at the time and place fixed for hearing. 
                  (4)  If, after such notice and hearing, the court determines that the dwelling, building, or structure in question is unfit for human habitation or is unfit for its current commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes, is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes, or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the court shall state, in writing, findings of fact in support of such determination, and shall issue and cause to be served upon the interested parties that have answered the complaint or appeared at the hearing an order: 
                  a.  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter, or improve such dwelling, building, or structure so as to bring it into full compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violation, and, if applicable, to secure the structure so that it cannot be used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or 
                  b.  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure, in order to bring it into full compliance with applicable codes relevant to the cited violations, cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to demolish and remove such dwelling, building, or structure and all debris from the property. 
                  For purposes of this section, the court shall make its determination of "reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure" without consideration of the value of the land on which the structure is situated; provided, however, that costs of the preparation necessary to repair, alter, or improve a structure may be considered. Income and financial status of the owner shall not be a factor in the court's determination. The present value of the structure and the costs of repair, alteration, or improvement may be established by affidavits of real estate appraisers with a Georgia appraiser classification as provided in O.C.G.A. title 43, ch. 39A (O.C.G.A. § 43-39A-1 et seq.), qualified building contractors, or qualified building inspectors, without actual testimony presented. Costs of repair, alteration, or improvement of the structure shall be the cost necessary to bring the structure into compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violations in force in the jurisdiction. 
                  (5)  In no event shall the city council require removal or demolition of any dwelling, building, or structure within the city except upon a finding that the cost of repair, alteration, or improvement thereof exceeds one-half the value such dwelling, building, or structure will have when repaired to satisfy the minimum requirements of this law; provided further, that a finding by the nuisance hearing officer that the costs of repair, alteration, or improvement exceeds one-half the value such dwelling, building or structure will have when repaired may be accepted by the city council without the necessity of hearing further evidence on the question; and provided further, that even if such costs shall exceed one-half of such value, the owner or party in interest shall still be given the opportunity to repair, alter, or improve the structure within the time specified by the nuisance hearing officer in order to prevent the demolition or removal of such structure. 
                  (6)  If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair or demolish the dwelling, building, or structure, the nuisance hearing officer may cause such dwelling, building, or structure to be repaired, altered, or improved or to be vacated and closed or demolished. Such abatement action shall commence within 270 days after the expiration of time specified in the order for abatement by the owner. Any time during which such action is prohibited by a court order issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 41-2-13 or any other equitable relief granted by a court of competent jurisdiction shall not be counted toward the 270 days in which such abatement action must commence. The nuisance hearing officer shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of the building, dwelling, or structure a placard with the following words: 
                  "This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business use and does not comply with the applicable codes, or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with drug crimes, or constitutes an endangerment to public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful." 
                  (7)  If the owner or parties in interest fail to comply with any order to remove or demolish the dwelling, building, or structure, the nuisance hearing officer may cause such dwelling, building, or structure to be removed or demolished; provided, however, that the duties of the nuisance hearing officer with regard to the repair, alteration, or improvement, or demolition and removal of such structure by the city or at its direction, shall not be exercised until the city council shall have, by ordinance, ordered the nuisance hearing officer to proceed to effectuate the purpose of this article and of O.C.G.A. §§ 41-2-7 through 41-2-17 with respect to the particular property which the nuisance hearing officer shall have found to be unfit for human habitation or unfit for its current commercial, industrial, or business use, which property shall be described in the ordinance ordering the nuisance hearing officer to proceed with regard to such property. 
                  (8)  If the nuisance abatement officer has the structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any moneys received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. The nuisance abatement officer and city council are relieved of any and all liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials. 
                  (9)  The amount of the cost of demolition, including all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the county tax commissioner or municipal tax collector or city revenue officer, and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, including restoration to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred.

                  (1)  The owner or parties at interest shall be allowed to satisfy the amount due on such lien by paying to the city, within 30 days after the perfection of said lien, a sum of money equal to 25 percent of the total amount due, and by further paying to the city the remaining balance due on such lien, together with interest at the rate of seven percent per annum, in three equal annual payments, each of which shall become due and payable on the anniversary date of the initial payment made as hereinabove prescribed; 
                  (2)  Should the property upon which such lien is perfected be sold, transferred, or conveyed by the owner or parties at interest at any time prior to the termination of said three-year period, then the entire balance due on such lien shall be due and payable to the city; and

                  (d)  Factors considered in granting special use permits for towers and antennas. In addition to any standards for consideration of special use permit applications contained in this section or any other applicable city ordinances, the city council shall consider the following factors in determining whether to issue a special use permit, although the city council may waive or reduce the burden on the applicant of one or more of these criteria if the city council concludes that the goals of this article are better served thereby: 
                  (1)  Height of the proposed tower; 
                  (2)  Proximity of the tower or residential structures and residential district boundaries; 
                  (3)  Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties; 
                  (4)  Surrounding topography; 
                  (5)  Surrounding tree coverage and foliage; 
                  (6)  Design of the tower, with particular reference to design characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual obtrusiveness; 
                  (7)  Proposed ingress and egress; 
                  (8)  Availability of suitable existing towers, other structures, or alternative technologies not requiring the use of towers or structures; and 
                  (9)  A written report from a consultant retained by the city which contains an evaluation of such special use permit application and the materials that the applicant submitted therewith concerning whether the proposed tower or antenna may interfere in any way with any existing or proposed wireless communications facilities within the city (which interference shall be prohibited), and whether the proposed tower or antenna, the related application and such materials meet the requirements of this section and all other applicable city ordinances. The applicant shall reimburse the city with respect to such consultant's fees and expenses promptly upon receipt of each invoice therefor. 
                  (e)  Availability of suitable existing towers, other structures, or alternative technology. No new tower shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the city council that no existing tower, structure or alternative technology that does not require the use of towers or structures located in the city or in nearby jurisdictions can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna. An applicant shall submit information to the city council regarding the availability of suitable existing towers, other structures or alternative technology located in the city and in nearby jurisdictions. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing tower, structure or alternative technology can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna may consist of any of the following: 
                  (1)  No existing towers or structures (including, without limitation, water towers, church steeples, street lights or power poles) are located within the geographic area which meet the applicant's engineering requirements. 
                  (2)  Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to meet the applicant's engineering requirements. 
                  (3)  Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support the applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment. 
                  (4)  The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the existing towers or structures, or the antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the applicant's proposed antenna. 
                  (5)  The fees, costs, or contractual provisions required by the owner in order to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower or structure for sharing are unreasonable. 
                  (6)  The applicant demonstrates that there are other material limiting factors that render existing towers and structures unsuitable. 
                  (7)  The applicant demonstrates that an alternative technology that does not require the use of towers or structures, such as a cable micro-cell network using multiple low-powered transmitters/receivers attached to a wireline system, is unsuitable. Costs of alternative technology that exceed new tower or antenna development shall not be presumed to render the technology unsuitable. 
                  (8)  The applicant must provide documentary evidence reasonably satisfactory to the city council that the applicant has used his best efforts to site the proposed personal wireless service facilities on existing towers, structures or alternative technology located in the city or any nearby jurisdiction in which an existing tower, structure or alternative technology is located that could be used to provide personal wireless service to the citizens of the city. 
                  (9)  Documentary evidence that the proposed tower or antenna and the proposed site meet Federal Communications Commission statutes and regulations. 
                  (10)  Documentary evidence that the proposed tower or antenna and the proposed site comply with the National Environmental Policy Act and all applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations. 
                  (11)  A phase one environmental assessment shall be required if the proposed tower or antenna site is in any of the following areas: 
                  a.  An officially designated wilderness area; 
                  b.  An officially designated wildlife preserve; 
                  c.  A 100-year floodplain (as determined by the Federal Emergency Management Agency's flood insurance maps); 
                  d.  A location that may affect threatened or endangered species under the Federal Endangerment Species Act; 
                  e.  Historic districts or sites listed or eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places; 
                  f.  Native American religious sites; 
                  g.  A location that could cause significant change in surface features, e.g., filling of wetlands, deforestation, or water diversion; or 
                  h.  A location that would involve use of high-intensity white lights in any residential district.

                  ARTICLE III. - ALARM SYSTEMS 

                  Sec. 12-81. - Findings and purpose. 
                  The city council finds that the resources of the city, and, in particular, the police and fire department, have been unnecessarily expended in responding to false alarms caused by the inadvertence, negligence and/or omissions of users of alarm systems. The time and resources of police personnel and equipment have been unnecessarily diverted and expended in responding to burglar alarm signals in situations where, in fact, no illegal entry or other intrusion had taken place. The purpose of this article is to preserve the resources of the city, particularly the police and fire department, for situations and incidents in which those services are truly needed by residents of the city, by requiring alarm users to exercise reasonable care in the operation of their alarm systems. Toward this end, this article places a reasonable limit on the number of false alarms which may occur at any one location during the calendar year, and establishes fines for false alarms in excess of that number.

                  (5)  Agricultural operations, as defined in O.C.G.A. § 1-3-3, Definitions, to include raising, harvesting or storing of products of the field or orchard; feeding, breeding or managing livestock or poultry; producing or storing feed for use in the production of livestock, including, but not limited to, cattle, calves, swine, hogs, goats, sheep, and rabbits or for use in the production of poultry, including, but not limited to, chickens, hens and turkeys; producing plants, trees, fowl, or animals; the production of aqua culture, horticultural, dairy, livestock, poultry, eggs and apiarian products; farm buildings and farm ponds; 
                  (6)  Forestry land management practices, including harvesting; provided, however, that when such exempt forestry practices cause or result in land disturbing or other activities otherwise prohibited in a buffer, as established in section 14-22(c)(15) and (16), no other land disturbing activities, except for normal forest management practices, shall be allowed on the entire property upon which the forestry practices were conducted for a period of three years after completion of such forestry practices; 
                  (7)  Any project carried out under the technical supervision of the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) of the United States Department of Agriculture; 
                  (8)  Any project involving less than one acre of disturbed area; provided, however, that this exemption shall not apply to any land disturbing activity within a larger common plan of development or sale with a planned disturbance of equal to or greater than one acre or within 200 feet of the bank of any state waters, and for purposes of this subsection, the term "state waters" excludes channels and drainage ways which have water in them only during and immediately after rainfall events and intermittent streams which do not have water in them year-round; provided, however, that any person responsible for a project which involves less than one acre, which involves land disturbing activity, and which is within 200 feet of any such excluded channel or drainage way, must prevent sediment from moving beyond the boundaries of the property on which such project is located, and provided, further, that nothing contained herein shall prevent the local issuing authority from regulating any such project which is not specifically exempted by subsections (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (9) or (10) of this section; 
                  (9)  Construction or maintenance projects, or both, undertaken or financed in whole or in part, or both, by the department of transportation, the state highway authority, or the state road and tollway authority; or any road construction or maintenance project, or both, undertaken by any county or municipality; provided, however, that construction or maintenance projects of the department of transportation or the state road and tollway authority which disturb one or more contiguous acres of land shall be subject to provisions of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7.1; except where the department of transportation, the state highway authority, or the state road and tollway authority is a secondary permittee for a project located within a larger common plan of development or sale under the state general permit, in which case, a copy of a notice of intent under the state general permit shall be submitted to the local issuing authority, the local issuing authority shall enforce compliance with the minimum requirements set forth in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 as if a permit had been issued, and violations shall be subject to the same penalties as violations by permit holders; 
                  (10)  Any land disturbing activities conducted by any electrical membership corporation or municipal electrical system or any public utility under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Public Service Commission, any utility under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, any cable television system as defined in O.C.G.A. § 36-18-1, or any agency or instrumentality of the United States engaged in the generation, transmission, or distribution of power; except where an electrical membership corporation or municipal electrical system or any public utility under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Public Service Commission, any utility under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, any cable television system as defined in O.C.G.A. § 36-18-1, or any agency or instrumentality of the United States engaged in the generation, transmission, or distribution of power is a secondary permittee for a project located within a larger common plan of development or sale under the state general permit, in which case, the local issuing authority shall enforce compliance with the minimum requirements set forth in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 as if a permit had been issued, and violations shall be subject to the same penalties as violations by permit holders; and

                  State Law reference— Similar provisions, O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17. 
                  Sec. 14-22. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices. 
                  (a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land disturbing activities if requirements of the ordinance and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of this section. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit. 
                  (b)  Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
                  (1)  Best management practices as set forth in subsections (b) and (c) of this section shall be required for all land disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with subsection (b)(2) of this section or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act. As used in this subsection, the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
                  (2)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries, or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This subsection shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
                  (5)  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsections (c)(15) and (16) of this section, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
                  (c)  Additional requirements . The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975 (O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.) for the purpose of governing land disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the state soil and water conservation commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)  Cut/fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  (7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in runoff water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this subsection, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975 (O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.); 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)  Land disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection (b)(2) of this section; 
                  (15)  Construction site operators are also responsible for implementing effective erosion and sediment control best management practices at all times. This includes waste control at the construction site, including, but not limited to, proper management of discarded building materials, concrete truck washout, chemicals, litter, and sanitary waste at the construction site to prevent adverse impacts to water quality; 
                  (16)  Except as provided in subsection (17) of this section, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream that, under normal circumstances, has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground water table year-round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to the Metropolitan River Protection Act (O.C.G.A. § 12-5-440 et seq.) shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this subsection. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer, and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
                  1.  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
                  2.  Stream crossings for sewer lines. 
                  (17)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as trout streams pursuant to the Georgia Water Quality Control Act (O.C.G.A. § 12-5-20 et seq.), except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.  No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer, and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
                  1.  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
                  2.  Stream crossings for sewer lines. 
                  (18)  There is established a 25-foot buffer along coastal marshlands, as measured horizontally from the coastal marshland-upland interface, as determined in accordance with the Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1970 (O.C.G.A. § 12-5-280) and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where an alteration within the buffer area has been authorized pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-286, for maintenance of any currently serviceable structure, landscaping, or hardscaping, including bridges, roads, parking lots, golf courses, golf cart paths, retaining walls, bulkheads, and patios; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, where a drainage structure or roadway drainage structure is constructed or maintained; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, on the landward side of any currently serviceable shoreline stabilization structure, or for the maintenance of any manmade stormwater detention basin, golf course pond, or impoundment that is located entirely within the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. For the purposes of this subsection, the term "maintenance" shall be defined as actions necessary or appropriate for retaining or restoring a currently serviceable improvement to the specified operable condition to achieve its maximum useful life. The term "maintenance" includes emergency reconstruction of recently damaged parts of a currently serviceable structure, so long as it occurs within a reasonable period of time after damage occurs. The term "maintenance" does not include any modification that changes the character, scope or size of the original design, and the term "serviceable" shall be defined as usable in its current state or with minor maintenance, but not so degraded as to essentially require reconstruction. 
                  a.  No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to crossings for utility lines that cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
                  c.  The buffer shall not apply to any land disturbing activity conducted pursuant to and in compliance with a valid and effective land disturbing permit issued subsequent to April 22, 2014, and prior to December 31, 2015; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, or any lot for which the preliminary plat has been approved prior to December 31, 2015, if roadways, bridges, or water and sewer lines have been extended to such lot prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived and if the requirement to maintain a 25-foot buffer would consume at least 18 percent of the high ground of the platted lot otherwise available for development; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications, and such measures are fully implemented. 
                  d.  Activities where the area within the buffer is not more than 500 square feet or that have a minor buffer impact as defined in rule 391-3-7-.01(r), provided that the total area of buffer impacts is less than 5,000 square feet, are deemed to have an approved buffer variance by rule. Bank stabilization structures are not eligible for coverage under the variance by rule, and notification shall be made to the division at least 14 days prior to the commencement of land disturbing activities. 
                  (d)  Nothing contained in the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975 (O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.) shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. 
                  (e)  The fact that land disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
                  (Ord. No. 301, § IV, 2-16-2017) 
                  Sec. 14-23. - Application/permit process. 
                  (a)  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review, before submittal, the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
                  (b)  Application requirements. 
                  (1)  No person shall conduct any land disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the city without first obtaining a permit from the city manager to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to the EPD, as applicable. 
                  (2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the city manager or his designee and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection (c) of this section. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of section 14-22(b) and (c) will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by up to six copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD rule 391-3-7-.10. Additional copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans may also be submitted directly to the EPD, as specified by the city manager. 
                  (3)  A land disturbance fee in the amount designated on the current approved fee schedule shall be paid to the city prior to land disturbance for clearing and grubbing activities and/or grading and construction activities. 
                  (4)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a), half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  (5)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by section 14-22(c)(15), (16), and (17) have been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per subsection (b)(7) of this section, has been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
                  (6)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975 (O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.), as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
                  (7)  The local issuing authority requires the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to the amount specified in the current fee schedule prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  (c)  Plan requirements. 
                  (1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in section 14-22(b) and (c), or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this article. The plan for the land disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and stormwater management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
                  (2)  Data required for a site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land disturbing activity was permitted. 
                  (d)  Permits. 
                  (1)  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable, but in any event, not later than 45 days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary, and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
                  (2)  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this article, any variances required by section 14-22(c)(15), (16) and (17) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per subsection (b)(7) of this section are met, and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
                  (3)  Any land disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this article and any other ordinances relating to land development as are applied to private persons, and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
                  (4)  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
                  (5)  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this article. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan or the conditions contained in the permit. 
                  (6)  The LIA may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(f)(1).

                  Sec. 14-24. - Inspection and enforcement. 
                  (a)  The city will periodically inspect the sites of land disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plans and if the measures required in the plans are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees, as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article. 
                  (b)  The local issuing authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within 12 months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975. 
                  (c)  The city shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this article, and for this purpose, to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land disturbing activities. 
                  (d)  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
                  (e)  The district or the commission, or both, shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). The district or the commission, or both, may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
                  (f)  The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within 90 days after notification by the division, the division shall revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority.

                  (a)  Failure to obtain a permit for land disturbing activity. If any person commences any land disturbing activity requiring a land disturbing permit as prescribed in this article without first obtaining said permit, the person shall be subject to revocation of his business license, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a business and associated work activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. 
                  (b)  Stop-work orders. 
                  (1)  For the first and second violations of the provisions of this article, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have five days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within five days, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a stop-work order requiring that land disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided, however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order in lieu of a warning. 
                  (2)  For a third and each subsequent violation, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order. 
                  (3)  All stop-work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. 
                  (4)  When a violation in the form of taking action without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer, or significant amounts of sediment, as determined by the local issuing authority or by the director or his designee, have been or are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained, a stop-work order shall be issued by the local issuing authority or by the director or his designee. All such stop-work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop-work orders shall apply to all land disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls. 
                  (c)  Bond forfeiture. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land disturbing activities has failed to comply with the approved plan, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed.

                  ARTICLE III. - WETLANDS 

                  Sec. 14-60. - Purpose. 
                  (a)  The wetlands in the city are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion, and soil limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve persons and nature. They provide habitat areas of fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; and open space and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well-being of many communities within the state. 
                  (b)  Nationally, a considerable number of these important natural resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution and other acts. Piecemeal or cumulative losses will, over time, destroy additional wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare. 
                  (c)  The purpose of this article is to promote wetlands protection, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational and aesthetic values. Activities that may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practicable as determined through a permitting process.

                  Sec. 14-61. - Definitions. 
                  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Generalized wetlands map means the current U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory map for the City of Lookout Mountain, Georgia. 
                  Jurisdictional wetland means an area that meets the definitional requirements for wetlands as determined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
                  Jurisdictional wetland determination means a delineation of jurisdictional wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act, 33 USC 1344, as amended. 
                  Regulated activity means any activity which will, or which may reasonably be expected to, result in the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States, excepting those activities exempted in section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act. 
                  Wetlands means those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface water or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas. The ecological parameters for designating wetlands include hydric soils, hydrophytic vegetation, and hydrological conditions that involve a temporary or permanent source of water to cause soil saturation.

                  Sec. 14-62. - Establishment of the wetlands protection district. 
                  (a)  The wetlands protection district is hereby established, which shall correspond to all lands within the jurisdiction of the city that are mapped as wetland areas by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service national wetlands inventory map. This map shall be referred to as the generalized wetlands map and is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this article, together with all explanatory matter thereon and attached thereto. 
                  (b)  The generalized wetlands map does not represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the city and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this article does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements.

                  ARTICLE IV. - ILLICIT DISCHARGES TO STORM SEWERS 

                  Sec. 14-91. - Introduction. 
                  (a)  It is hereby determined that: 
                  (1)  Discharges to the city, separate storm sewer system that are not composed entirely of stormwater runoff contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters. 
                  (2)  These non-stormwater discharges occur due to spills, dumping and improper connections to the city, separate storm sewer system from residential, industrial, commercial or institutional establishments. 
                  (3)  These non-stormwater discharges not only impact waterways individually, but geographically dispersed, small volume non-stormwater discharges can also have cumulative impacts on receiving waters. 
                  (4)  The impacts of these discharges adversely affect public health and safety, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters. 
                  (5)  These impacts can be minimized through the regulation of spills, dumping and discharges into the city, separate storm sewer system. 
                  (6)  Localities in the state are required to comply with a number of state and federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution due to improper non-stormwater discharges to the city, separate storm sewer system. 
                  (b)  Therefore, the city, adopts the ordinance from which this article is derived to prohibit such non-stormwater discharges to the city's separate storm sewer system. It is determined that the regulation of spills, improper dumping and discharges to the city, separate storm sewer system is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety, and the environment.

                  ARTICLE V. - STORMWATER RUNOFF 

                  Sec. 14-125. - Introduction. 
                  (a)  It is hereby determined that: 
                  (1)  Land development projects and other land use conversions and their associated changes to land cover permanently alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, which in turn increase flooding, stream channel erosion, and sediment transport and deposition. 
                  (2)  Land development projects and other land use conversions also contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters. 
                  (3)  The impacts of post-development stormwater runoff quantity and quality can adversely affect public safety, public and private property, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters. 
                  (4)  These adverse impacts can be controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff quantity and quality from new development and redevelopment, by the use of both structural facilities as well as nonstructural measures, such as the conservation of open space and green space areas. The preservation and protection of natural area and green space for stormwater management benefits is encouraged through the use of incentives or credits. The Georgia Green Space Program provides a mechanism for the preservation and coordination of those green space areas which provide stormwater management quality and quantity benefits. 
                  (5)  Localities in the state are required to comply with a number of both state and federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of post-development stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution. 
                  (b)  Therefore, the city has established this set of stormwater management policies to provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of post-development stormwater runoff for the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation. It has determined that it is in the public interest to regulate post-development stormwater runoff discharges in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes, post-construction soil erosion and sedimentation, stream channel erosion, and nonpoint source pollution associated with post-development stormwater runoff. 
                  (Ord. No. 226, § 1, 10-19-2006) 
                  Sec. 14-126. - General provisions. 
                  (a)  Purpose and intent. The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-development stormwater runoff and nonpoint source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment. It has been determined that proper management of post-development stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety, environment and general welfare of the public, and protect water and aquatic resources. This article seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives: 
                  (1)  Establish decision-making processes surrounding land development activities that protect the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources; 
                  (2)  Require that new development and redevelopment maintain the pre-development hydrologic response in its post-development state as nearly as practicable in order to reduce flooding, streambank erosion, nonpoint source pollution and increases in stream temperature, and maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats; 
                  (3)  Establish minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality; 
                  (4)  Establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater control facilities that can be used to meet the minimum post-development stormwater management standards; 
                  (5)  Encourage the use of nonstructural stormwater management and stormwater better site design practices, such as the preservation of green space and other conservation areas, to the maximum extent practicable. Coordinate site design plans, which include green space, with the county's green space protection plan; 
                  (6)  Establish provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of structural stormwater control facilities and nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained, and pose no threat to public safety; and 
                  (7)  Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans, and for the inspection of approved active projects, and long-term follow up. 
                  (b)  Applicability. 
                  (1)  This article shall be applicable to all land development, including, but not limited to, site plan applications, subdivision applications, and grading applications, unless exempt pursuant to subsection (b)(2) of this section. These standards apply to any new development or redevelopment site that meets one or more of the following criteria: 
                  a.  New development that involves the creation of 5,000 square feet or more of impervious cover, or that involves other land development activities of one acre or more; 
                  b.  Redevelopment that includes the creation, addition or replacement of 5,000 square feet or more of impervious cover, or that involves other land development activity of one acre or more; 
                  c.  Any new development or redevelopment, regardless of size, that is defined by the superintendent of the sewer department of the city or his designee to be a hotspot land use; or 
                  d.  Land development activities that are smaller than the minimum applicability criteria set forth in subsection (b)(1)a and b of this section if such activities are part of a larger common plan of development, even though multiple, separate and distinct land development activities may take place at different times on different schedules. 
                  (2)  The following activities are exempt from this article:

                  (3)  To authorize upon appeal in specific cases such variance from terms of the aforesaid zoning ordinance or resolution as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of the ordinance or resolution will, in an individual case, result in unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of the ordinance or resolution shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. Such variance may be granted in such individual case of unnecessary hardship upon a finding by the board that: 
                  a.  There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape or topography;

                  (4)  In exercising any of the above powers, the board may, after notice and hearing, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision, or determination, and to that end, shall have all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken and may issue or direct the issuance of a permit.

                  (f)  Swales or ditch lines paralleling the roadway shall be graded a minimum of one percent where possible, and in no case will grades of less than 0.5 percent be allowed. Where at all possible, main drainage ways shall be cut to the rear of lot lines and not carried down the roadway. 
                  (g)  If a drainage pipe is under 30 inches in diameter, located in the ditch line, and more than 100 feet long, concrete or solid masonry catch basins with a six-inch minimum wall thickness shall be required at intervals of 100 feet or at lot lines, whichever is less. The design of these catch basins shall conform to drawings approved by the city engineer. 
                  (h)  Where there are long grades, relief pipes shall be placed. The maximum interval of relief pipes shall be 500 feet. 
                  (i)  Should a bridge or large drainage structure be required to provide proper drainage, it shall be designed by a licensed civil engineer and approved by the city engineer. 
                  (j)  Before any preliminary or final subdivision plat is approved, the subdivider must submit plans and specifications demonstrating that the proposed subdivision, when developed, will be in full compliance with all laws of the state and all ordinances of the city pertaining to stormwater runoff, illicit discharges, and soil erosion and sedimentation. The subdivider must likewise obtain all permits required by the state and/or the city pertaining to stormwater runoff, illicit discharges, and soil erosion and sedimentation. To help defray the added stormwater management costs which the city will incur as a result of the development of the subdivision, the subdivider will pay to the city, prior to the approval of each preliminary plat, a stormwater impact fee in such amount as may from time to time be established by the city council.

                  (a)  Findings and intent. The ordinance from which this section is derived is adopted in the interest of public safety. Motorized carts and other similar vehicles are not designed or manufactured to be used on public highways, streets and roads (hereafter public roads), and the city in no way advocates their operation on the public roads within its jurisdiction. Adoption of the ordinance from which this section is derived is not to be relied upon as a determination by the city that the operation of motorized carts or other similar vehicles on public roads is safe or advisable if done in accordance with this section. By regulating such operation, the city is merely addressing safety issues. All persons who operate or ride in motorized carts or other similar vehicles on public roads do so based on their own judgment and at their own risk and must be observant of and attentive to the safety of themselves and others, including their passengers, other motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians. Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the city has no liability in negligence, nuisance or under any other cause of action for injuries or losses resulting from the use of motorized carts or other similar vehicles on roads, sidewalks, recreation paths, rights-of-way or other public property. Any person who operates motorized carts or other similar vehicles is responsible for procuring appropriate insurance as may be required by state law and this section. 
                  (b)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:

Children's car seats may only be used in the front seats of motorized carts and in middle, forward-facing seats. Under no circumstances may children's car seats be used in rear-facing seats on the back of a motorized cart. 
                  (6)  Motorized carts must at all times be maintained in a manner which ensures an unobstructed view from the driver's seat looking forward and to the rear. 
                  (7)  All motorized carts operating in the city must have four wheels. Motorized carts must be equipped with head lamps, stop lamps, turn signal lamps, tail lamps, two reflex reflectors on the rear of the vehicle, and a vehicle serial number. The required reflex reflectors may be included as part of the housing for the tail lamps or may be separate. 
                  (8)  Motorized carts operating in the city must be capable of traveling at a minimum speed of 15 miles per hour. The registration process contemplated by subsection (d)(10) of this section will include verification that the motorized cart is capable of traveling at least 19 miles per hour. 
                  (9)  Gasoline-powered motorized carts are specifically prohibited. 
                  (10)  The owner of each motorized cart to be operated within the city must register such motorized cart with the city clerk before the motorized cart may be operated within the city. Registration will be on such forms as may be requested by the city clerk, and such forms shall include, at a minimum, the owner's name and address, the type of motorized cart (e.g., golf cart), the vehicle serial number, the insurance carrier providing liability insurance for the motorized cart, and the insurance policy number. Proof of liability insurance with policy limits equal to the minimum limits required for other motor vehicles in the state must be provided to the city clerk as a condition of registration. Each such registration must be renewed annually. A registration fee as determined by the city council from time to time per year will be charged. 
                  (11)  Two numerical decals will be issued to the owner of the motorized cart upon each registration and renewal under subsection (d)(10) of this section. Such decals shall be affixed to the right front and right rear of each motorized cart and must be easily visible as proof of current registration. A record of each motorized cart's serial number, current decal number, name and address of the owner, and liability insurance policy number will be maintained by the city clerk. 
                  (e)  Violations. The chief of police or any police officer of the city may issue citations for violations of this section. In determining the amount of the fine to be assessed for a violation, the municipal judge may consider whether the motorized cart was being operated on any road or highway not authorized by this section or had crossed a county or state road or highway at a prohibited location, whether there was a violation of this section's requirements regarding seatbelts, whether any minor children were on the motorized cart at the time the violation occurred, and/or whether the motorized cart was being operated without being properly registered as required by subsection (d)(10) of this section. If motorized carts owned by any person are the subject of three violations of this section, the registrations for all motorized carts owned by that person shall be immediately and automatically revoked, and that person may not thereafter register or operate any motorized cart within the city.

                  (a)  Before the owner of any property within or beyond the corporate limits of the city connects such property to the city sewer, he or his agent shall make application to the city manager or superintendent for, and have issued to him, a permit so to do. Such work shall only be performed by a professional plumber who must sign the permit. The permit application shall be a form prescribed by the city. All connections shall be inspected and approved by the city before being used. 
                  (b)  Connections made without an approved application may be cut off by order of the city manager or superintendent. Such unapproved connection may be allowed to remain active if inspected and accepted, however, the owner shall be required to pay a fee in lieu of a permit application fee that is double the regular permit fee then in effect.

                  Sec. 34-29. - Limitations on point of discharge; temporary facilities. 
                  No person shall discharge any substance directly into a manhole or other opening in a city sanitary sewer other than through an approved sewer line for a building, unless he shall have been issued a temporary permit by the city manager or superintendent. A temporary permit may be issued in the discretion of the city manager or superintendent to provide for discharges from portable sanitary facilities for festivals or public shows or for other reasonable purposes. The city manager or superintendent shall incorporate in such a temporary permit such conditions as he deems reasonably necessary to ensure compliance with the provisions of this article. The user shall be required to pay reasonable charges and fees for the permit and service in an amount not less than the charges and fees for normal discharges. Any discharge other than through an approved building sewer line or upon a permit issued by the city manager or superintendent shall be unlawful.

                  Sec. 34-32. - Limitations on the use of garbage grinders. 
                  No waste from garbage grinders shall be discharged into the city's sewers except for private garbage grinders used in an individual residence or upon permit issued by the city manager or superintendent for preparation of food consumed on premises, and then only where applicable fees therefor are paid. Installation of any garbage grinder equipped with a three-fourths horsepower (or greater) motor shall require a permit. The city manager or superintendent may issue a permit when there is inadequate space on the user's premises to properly store food preparation waste between regularly scheduled garbage pickup by city crews or a private collection service with equal or greater frequency of collection. All garbage grinders used within the city (whether or not requiring a permit) must shred the waste sufficiently that it can be carried freely under normal flow conditions prevailing in the city's sewer lines. It shall be unlawful for any person to use a garbage grinder connected to the sewer system for the purpose of grinding and discharging plastic, paper products, inert materials or anything other than the waste products from normal food preparation and consumption.

                  Sec. 34-34. - Assessment of damages to users. 
                  When the discharge of waste or any other act or omission causes an obstruction, damage, or any other impairment to the city's facilities, causing an expense or damages of whatever character or nature to the city, the city manager or superintendent shall assess the expenses and damages incurred by the city to clear an obstruction, repair damage to the facility, and otherwise rectify any impairment, and bill the person responsible for the damage for reimbursement of all expenses and damages suffered by the city. If the person responsible refuses to pay, then the city manager or superintendent shall forward a copy of the statement and documentation of all expenses to the city attorney who shall be authorized to take such legal action as shall be appropriate. Such expenses shall constitute a lien on the property to which they relate, and the city attorney may, among other things, file appropriate evidence or documentation of the lien with the office of the clerk of superior court of the county, and may foreclose upon or otherwise enforce the lien in the same manner that city tax liens are enforced. If referral to the city attorney is made, the property owner will be responsible for paying the reasonable fees and expenses of the city attorney which shall be added to and constitute a part of the lien against the property.

                  Sec. 34-35. - Violations; discontinuance of water service. 
                  (a)  Other remedies. In addition to other remedies, the city manager or superintendent may issue a show cause notice to any user who appears to be violating any provisions of this article to show cause why sewer service should not be discontinued. The notice shall include the nature of the violation with sufficient specificity as to the character of the violation, and the date on which such violations occurred to enable the user to prepare a defense. Such notice shall be mailed to the user by certified mail, return receipt requested, or shall be personally delivered to the user at least 20 days prior to the proposed action, except in the event of an emergency. Such mailing or delivery may be made either to the user's last-known address as shown on the city's tax records or to the address of the property in question. At the show cause hearing, the user may present any defense he may have to such charges, either in person or through submission of written or documentary proof. Following such hearing or opportunity for a hearing, the city manager or superintendent may, in his discretion, order the termination of sewer service if satisfied from all the proof available that the violation was willful and the termination is necessary to abate the offending condition, or to prevent future violations. The city manager or superintendent may terminate service for a period not to exceed one year for a willful violation and may terminate service indefinitely to abate offending conditions or prevent future violations, subject to the correction of such conditions or violations by the user. 
                  (b)  Emergency termination of service. If, in the opinion of the city manager or superintendent, it appears that such violation presents or may present an emergency situation endangering the public health, the environment, sewer system personnel, or the operation of the system, he may take immediate action to abate the condition and terminate service. In the event such emergency action adversely affects the user, the city manager or superintendent shall provide the user an opportunity for a hearing as soon as practicable thereafter to consider restoration of service upon abatement of the condition or other reasonable conditions. Following the hearing, the city manager or superintendent may take any such action authorized by subsection (c) of this section should the proof warrant such action. 
                  (c)  Water service. Any violation of this article which is not corrected or abated following a notice and opportunity for a hearing shall be grounds for the termination of water service and/or plugging the sewer line, and the city may, in addition, pursue all other rights and remedies provided by this article or applicable law (including both statutory and common law).

                  Sec. 34-61. - Contracts with other entities. 
                  The mayor, city manager or other authorized city official may (subject to approval by the city council), enter into contracts with any municipality, county, incorporated district, business, college, association or other person or entity for the disposal of wastewater or sewage collected and pumped or delivered to some part of the city's sewer system; provided, however, that the charges to be paid for the disposal of such wastewater or sewage shall not be less than an amount which is fair and equitable, taking into account the cost to the city of such disposal and the cost of the sewage disposal system. All revenues received pursuant to such contracts shall be deemed to be revenues of the sewer system and shall be applied and accounted for in the same manner as other revenues derived from the operation of such system. Any such contract authorizing the disposal of wastewater or sewage into the city's sewer system by a business, college, association or other entity shall contain an obligation on the part of the business, college, association or other entity to indemnify and hold the city harmless from and against any and all claims, demands, liability, damages, costs, expenses and attorney fees in any way related to the design, construction, operation and maintenance of the sewer-related facilities and pipelines of such business, college, association or other entity, and the wastewater or sewage discharged into the city's sewer system. Any such contract may contain such other provisions which, in the judgment of the city attorney, are reasonable or necessary to protect the interests of the city.

                  (a)  The sewer service charges shall become effective upon water usage, shall be at the rates and other fees and charges hereinafter imposed, and shall be billed by the water company or by any other private or governmental entity with which the city may contract for sewer billing services. Such sewer charges shall be paid within 18 days after the issuance of the bill. If charges are not paid within said 18-day period, they shall be considered delinquent, and the city may, in addition to other available remedies, provide notice to the water company under applicable state law that water service to the customer is to be suspended. 
                  (b)  Sewer service charges shall be billed as a separate designated item on the bills issued by the water company or other billing service provider. 
                  (c)  Billing shall begin and the sewer service charges shall become payable upon the property owner's or occupant's connection to the city's sewer system or within 180 days after the city manager's or superintendent's issuance of notice pursuant to section 34-22(a) that sewer service is available for the property, whichever occurs first. Consistent with section 34-59, all owners or occupants to whom sewer service is available shall be billed for the sewer service charges regardless of whether they have elected to connect to the city's sewer system.

                  Sec. 34-64. - Schedule. 
                  (a)  Sewer service charges; quantity of water used. Sewer service charges shall be based upon the quantity of water used as shown by water meter readings and shall be the dollar amount derived by applying monetary rates per gallon, cubic foot or other measure to the quantities of water used. The rates per gallon, cubic foot, or other measure of water used shall be established from time to time by the city council and may be different for different quantities of water used. 
                  (b)  Additional monthly service charges. In addition to the sewer service charges based on the quantity of water used as set forth in subsection (a) of this section, each owner or occupant of a residential (both single-family and multifamily), commercial, institutional, tourist or church-related property which is obligated to pay sewer service charges pursuant to section 34-60 or pursuant to any contract or agreement with the city shall pay a monthly service charge in the amount determined from time to time by the city council for each lot or parcel of residential real estate and for each commercial, institutional, tourist or church-related establishment for which sewer service is provided or available.

                  Sec. 34-67. - Charges where water usage not metered. 
                  (a)  Generally. The owner or occupant of property obtaining water from a source other than through a meter of the water company which is discharged into the city's sewers shall install, without cost to the city, a meter to measure the quantity of water received from such source or the quantity of sewage generated by such source, and shall pay the same rates as provided in sections 34-64 and 34-65. No meter shall be installed or used for such purpose without the approval of the city manager or superintendent. If the owner of such property fails to install an approved meter, the city manager or superintendent shall make an estimate of the quantity of such water used by such property owner and discharged into the city's sewers from the property, and the owner or occupant of the property shall be liable to the city for the sewer service charges due, which may be collected by suit in any court of competent jurisdiction. 
                  (b)  Multi-unit complexes. To provide more equality between single-family and multi-unit dwellings (with just one or less number of water meters than the total number of dwelling units in the complex), sewer service charges to multi-unit apartment complexes or other multi-unit establishments served by master meters or any combination of meters totaling less than the number of units served shall be charged by the following formula: 
                  U[adj] x S[c] x O[c] 
                  Where: 
                  U[adj] = U[tot] / O[c]

                  Sec. 34-68. - Consumers not to be charged sewer user charges for water used for commercial purposes not discharged into city sewers. 
                  (a)  Secondary metering. Whenever a property upon which a sewer user charge is imposed under this article uses water for commercial purposes, which water so used is not discharged into the sewerage system of the city, the quantity of water so used and not discharged into the city's sewers shall be excluded in determining the sewer user charge of the owner or occupant, provided that the quantity of water so used and not discharged into the city sewers is measured by a device or meter (called a secondary meter) approved by the city manager or superintendent and installed by the owner or occupant without cost to the city. The sewer user charge based upon the consumption of water to be paid by the owner or occupant of such property shall be computed at the rates provided in this article, less the quantity not discharged into the city's sewers. The city reserves the right to require calibration of secondary meters when appropriate. A secondary meter shall meet the following requirements: 
                  (1)  Meters should read in 100 cubic feet. 
                  (2)  Meters must be located either in an outdoor meter box or vault, or inside the customer's building or structure in a clean, dry, safe place not subject to wide temperature variations so that the meter can be easily examined, read and removed. 
                  (3)  The customer shall, at his expense, provide suitable pipe connections and shut-off valves, one each at the inlet and outlet sides of the meter. 
                  (4)  The meter box or vault may be constructed to protect the meter from freezing and damage by vehicular traffic, and its location and design shall prevent, as far as possible, the inflow of surface water. 
                  (5)  Any changes in location of secondary meters, malfunctions, replacements or any other changes in the approved secondary meter installation must be reported to the city manager or superintendent in writing. Also, a copy must be forwarded to the water company containing all pertinent information regarding that particular meter. 
                  (6)  No retroactive credits will be issued, if the holder of the secondary meter permit fails to comply with the rules and regulations in force at any particular time. 
                  (7)  If any water exempted from the sewer service charge is returned to the sewer system at any time or point, a metering device shall be installed. Any flow registered through such a meter shall be charged for sewer service. 
                  (8)  Any secondary meter must be easily accessible by the water company. If this is not possible, remote-read meters shall be installed and be protected from any magnetic interference. It is the responsibility of the permit holder to ensure the accuracy of the remote read to the installed meter. 
                  (9)  All meters must be calibrated and certified for accuracy once every 18 months. The certification of the inspection, or a copy thereof, must be forwarded to the city manager or superintendent. 
                  (b)  Other sewer user charge credits. User charge credits may also be given by the city manager or superintendent for the following purposes: 
                  (1)  Hidden or underground leaks; 
                  (2)  Catastrophic leaks where water does not enter the sewer line; 
                  (3)  Where secondary meters are installed for swimming pools, lawn or garden watering, sprinkler systems, and other processes where water is used but not returned to the sewer; 
                  (4)  Filling a swimming pool will be allowed one credit per year for the initial fill if the water is not returned to the sewer at the end of the swimming season. 
                  No sewer user may receive a credit for an amount which would reduce the resultant sewer bill below the minimum charge required by section 34-65. To be considered for credit, leaks must be reported to the water company, and corrected by the owner or occupant without cost to the city. The sewer user charge based upon the consumption of water to be paid by the owner or occupant of such property shall be computed at the rates provided in this article, less the quantity not discharged into the city's sewers.

                  ARTICLE III. - SEWER ADVISORY BOARD 

                  Sec. 34-121. - Creation; purpose and authority. 
                  (a)  Creation and composition of sewer advisory board. The city hereby creates a board which shall be known as the sewer advisory board of the city (the board). The board will be composed of seven members. The city's sewer superintendent will be a standing member of the board, and the remaining six members of the board will be appointed by the city council. Four of the remaining six members of the board will be residents of the city, one of the remaining six members will be affiliated with Covenant College and need not be a resident of the city, and one of the remaining six members will be affiliated with the Brow Wood Development and need not be a resident of the city. 
                  (b)  Appointments and vacancies. Original appointments to the board will be for the following terms: one city resident and the Covenant College and Brow Wood representatives on the board will be appointed for a term of four years; one city resident will be appointed for a term of three years; one city resident will be appointed for a term of two years; and one city resident will be appointed for a term of one year. Subsequent appointments will be for terms of four years each. All resident and nonresident members of the board may, in the sole discretion of the city council, be reappointed to successive terms, or the city council may, in its sole discretion, choose to appoint different members. A vacancy on the board will occur if a board member resigns, dies, is physically or mentally unable to serve, is convicted of a felony or malfeasance in office, or accepts any federal, state, county, or other municipal office. A vacancy will also occur if one of the four resident members of the board ceases to be a resident of the city. Any vacancy in the membership of the board will be filled for the unexpired term by appointment by the city council. Members of the board will serve without compensation. 
                  (c)  Chair, vice-chair and secretary. The board will elect one of the four appointed city residents as its chair, and he will serve as chair for one year or until re-elected or until a successor is elected. The board will elect a second city resident as its vice-chair, and he will serve as vice-chair for one year or until re-elected or until a successor is elected. The board will appoint a secretary who may be a member of the board or who may be an official or employee of the city. 
                  (d)  Purpose and authority. The purpose of the board will be to act as an advisory board to the mayor and city council on matters relating to the city's sewer system, including budgeting, rates, maintenance, and short-term and long-term planning. The board will act solely in an advisory capacity and will have no authority to make policy, to adopt or establish budgets, or to set rates or fees. Rather, the board will make recommendations to the city council, and the city council will retain sole and final authority regarding all matters relating to the city's sewer system. The board may, in its discretion, prepare and submit to the city council for approval a more detailed mission statement setting forth more specific tasks and objectives consistent with the foregoing. 
                  (e)  Meetings and minutes. The board will meet at least twice a year and will prescribe the time, place, and dates of its regular meetings. The board may, at the call of the board chair, schedule special meetings in addition to its regular meetings. Notice of regular and special meetings will be provided and minutes will be kept in accordance with state law. Unless otherwise provided or permitted by state law, all proceedings and minutes of the board will be open to the public. 
                  (f)  Quorum and voting. Four members of the board will constitute a quorum. All members of the board (including the sewer superintendent and the chair and other appointed members) will be counted in determining whether a quorum exists. In making its recommendations to the city council and in taking any other authorized action, affirmative votes of a majority of the board members present will be required.

Except as required by law, there shall he no structural alterations on premises devoted to a nonconforming use, until such structural alterations have been specifically authorized by the Board of Zoning Appeals after receipt of the recommendation of the Municipal Planning Commission. If such nonconforming building or structure is removed or the nonconforming use of such building is discontinued for a period of time exceeding one hundred (100) consecutive days, every future use of such premises shall be in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. No signs visible from the exterior in connection with a nonconforming use shall be constructed except for those lettered upon windows of the building. 
                  Nonconforming buildings or structures may not be enlarged in any respect.

The lawful use of land existing at the original effective date of this chapter (i.e., May 18, 1970), although such use does not conform to the provisions of this chapter, shall not be affected by this chapter; provided, however, that no such nonconforming use shall be extended to occupy a greater area of land. If such nonconforming use is discontinued for a period of not less than one hundred (100) days, any future use of land shall be in conformity with the provisions of this chapter; provided, however, that where land is now used for a use excluded from the district in which such land is located, and such use is not accessory to the use of a main building located on the same lot or grounds, such nonconforming use of land shall be discontinued, and all material incident to such nonconforming use shall be completely removed by its owner not later than thirty (30) days from the passage of this chapter. 
                  The provisions of this chapter are not to be considered as making lawful any use of buildings, structures or lands which had heretofore been forbidden by ordinance or law, nor as enlarging upon or varying the nonconforming use heretofore permitted under the provisions of any prior or existing law or ordinance.

                  In the event any nonconforming building or structure shall, in the judgment of the Board of Zoning Appeals, become so dilapidated as to be dangerous to public health, safety or welfare, such nonconforming use may thereupon be ordered by said Board to be discontinued. Commencing thirty (30) days after written notification to such effect to the owner of such building or structure and any occupants, such nonconforming use shall become illegal, and no alteration or restoration shall have the effect of allowing resumption of such nonconforming use, regardless of whether such alteration or restoration is voluntary or in obedience to instructions of the Board of Zoning Appeals.

If any such nonconforming use in existence on the original effective date hereof (i.e., May 18, 1970) is removed or abandoned, any future use of the land shall be in full conformity with this chapter. No such nonconforming use shall be extended to occupy a greater portion of land than occupied on the original effective date hereof (i.e., May 18, 1970), nor to increase the number or size of nor to enlarge or extend the volume or intensity of any such nonconforming use.

                  (3)  Any property owner who does not maintain a fence or other structure regulated by this Ordinance in good repair and condition shall be required to make such reasonable modifications and/or repairs as are directed by the City Building Official and/or Municipal Planning Commission. 
                  (4)  The property owner's application for a permit to erect or place a fence, wall, screen or fence-like garden structure within the City of Lookout Mountain, as required by this Ordinance, shall constitute the property owner's approval, consent and permission for the Building Official to enter onto the property, either before or after the fence or other structure is erected, to review the condition of fences and other structures regulated by this Ordinance. If the property owner has not made application for a permit to erect the fence or other structure as required by this Ordinance, the Building Official may nevertheless enter onto the property for the aforesaid purpose, if (a) the property owner gives his or her written or verbal consent, or (b) the City gives the property owner ten (10) days' advance written notice of the Building Official's intent to enter onto the property. 
                  (5)  If, in his judgment, the Building Official believes a fence or other structure regulated by this Ordinance is not in compliance with this or other applicable Ordinances, he will report his findings to the Municipal Planning Commission which will then determine if the property owner is to be cited for noncompliance.

                  (1)  Brick, stone, manufactured stone and tile fences shall have a continuous concrete foundation that is a minimum of 30 inches wide and 12 inches thick with two # 4 continuous reinforcing bars. Such fences shall also have vertical reinforcing consisting of a minimum # 4 reinforcing bar at 32 inches on center. Vertical reinforcing shall be tied to the horizontal reinforcing. 
                  (2)  Wood fences with vertical posts shall have the posts spaced at not greater than eight feet on center. Posts shall have a 12-inch diameter concrete foundation around them and shall be set a minimum 30 inches deep. 
                  (3)  Vinyl or PVC fences shall have posts spaced not greater than eight feet on center. Posts shall be set a minimum two feet deep into a 12-inch diameter footing. All posts and horizontal rails shall have a steel inner sleeve for added strength. A manufacturer's non-prorated lifetime warranty must be provided to the Municipal Planning Commission if the fence is to be approved. 
                  (4)  Steel, decorative metal or aluminum fences shall have posts spaced not greater than eight feet on center, set a minimum two feet deep into a 12-inch diameter footing. 
                  (5)  Chain link fences are not allowed in front yards and may only be approved for rear and side yards if they do not exceed three (3) feet in height and are planted with sufficient shrubbery, bushes, hedges, plants, trees or other natural foliage which will grow to sufficient height and density to substantially cover and screen the outside of the fence from view within three to five years. 
                  (G)  Encroachment. Nothing contained in this Ordinance shall be interpreted to permit encroachment into adjacent lots or rights-of-way for the purpose of providing any screening and foliage cover required by this Ordinance. Any such required screening and foliage cover shall be placed and located solely within the property where the fence is erected or placed, but may be rooted on either the inside or the outside of the fence, so long as the outside of the fence has the required cover and screening. 
                  (H)  Existing Fences. The lawful use, size or location of a fence existing as of the effective date of this Ordinance shall not be affected by this Ordinance although such existing fence may not conform to or comply with the provisions hereof; provided, however, that such fences shall be maintained in good repair and condition as provided in this Ordinance, and no such fence shall be extended, enlarged or replaced except in full conformity and compliance with the terms hereof. 
                  (I)  Municipal Planning Commission Approval. 
                  (1)  Applications for permits to erect or place fences, walls, screens or fence-like garden structures within the City of Lookout Mountain must be made in writing to the Municipal Planning Commission. The Commission may require as a condition to considering the application such plans, drawings, photographs, maps, manufacturers' brochures and other data as it may deem material and may conduct such investigations and inquiries as it may deem necessary or expedient. All such plans, drawings, etc., shall be submitted to the Commission at least ten (10) calendar days before the meeting at which the application is to be considered. The applicant shall have the burden of showing to the satisfaction of the Commission that the proposed fence will not adversely affect motor vehicle and traffic safety, accessibility to buildings on the property in the event of fire or other emergency, police protection, accessibility for garbage and leaf service, the natural beauty of the neighborhood, and scenic views. The Commission may also consider such factors as objections of other persons in the neighborhood, the extent that adjacent and neighboring yards are open, and such other practical and aesthetic factors deemed material by the Commission. 
                  (2)  Except for the fences and other structures authorized by the limited exceptions set forth in Section 10-19(B) of this Ordinance, any fence, wall, screen or fence-like garden structure erected without the prior approval of the Municipal Planning Commission may be ordered removed by the City Building Official or the Municipal Planning Commission; provided, however, that if the property owner proves to the Commission that an illegally erected fence is in full compliance with the requirements of this Ordinance and pays a building permit fee twice the amount of the fee that would have otherwise been charged for the fence, the Commission may, in its discretion, allow the fence to remain. 
                  (3)  If a property owner fails to remove an illegally erected fence, wall, screen, or fence-like garden structure within thirty (30) days of notification from the City Building Official or Municipal Planning Commission, the City may, at its option, remove the fence at the property owner's expense. The cost of such removal shall constitute a lien on the property and may be collected by levy and sale of the property or by any other lawful means. 
                  (4)  In the event any property owner or other interested party is aggrieved by any decision of the Commission either granting or denying an application for the approval of a fence, or by any other action of the City Building Official or Municipal Planning Commission under this Ordinance, he may, within but no later than ten (10) days after such decision, petition the City Council in writing for a hearing, and the action of the City Council by resolution of a majority of the Council at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be final and binding upon the property owner or other interested party. 
                  ARTICLE V. - INTERPRETATION, AMENDMENT 

                  Sec. 10-20. - Interpretation, purpose and conflict. 
                  In interpreting and applying the provisions of this chapter, the chapter shall be held to contain the minimum requirements for the promotion of the public health, safety, morals and general welfare of the community. It is not intended by this chapter to limit, abrogate, or annul any easements, covenants, or other agreements between parties; provided, however, that where this chapter imposes a greater restriction upon the use of buildings, structures or premises or upon the height of buildings or structures, or requires larger open spaces than are imposed or required by other laws, ordinances, rules, regulations or by easements, covenants, or agreements, the provisions of this chapter shall control. 
                  Sec. 10-20.1. - Amendments of chapter—Initiation. 
                  The City Council may from time to time, after report thereon by the Municipal Planning Commission and after public hearing as required by law, amend, supplement or change the number, shape or boundaries of districts or any regulations or provisions of this chapter. Any such change may be initiated by the City Council, the Municipal Planning Commission, or by petition of the owners of fifty percent (50%) or more of the frontage within a given area. When initiated by the City Council, such change shall be referred to the Municipal Planning Commission for investigation and report as provided by the next section. Whenever an owner of property desires a change in classification thereof or a change in the regulations applying thereto, such owner shall present to the Municipal Planning Commission a petition duly signed and acknowledged by him, requesting such changes. No such change initiated or requested by the property owner may be considered unless all ad valorem taxes and any other taxes or charges owing either to the City of Lookout Mountain or to Walker County with respect to the property are current. Before the City Council or the Municipal Planning Commission considers any such change in the classification of the property or the regulations applying thereto, the City Council and/or Municipal Planning Commission may require the property owner to provide written verification from the City of Lookout Mountain and/or Walker County that all taxes, interest, penalties, attorney fees and other charges due and owing with respect to the property have been paid in full. 
                  As used in this Section 10-20.1, the words "amend," "change" or "supplement" include the request for a change, or other proceeding to provide new or different uses, regulations or conditions with respect to the classification, zoning or use of any property. 
                  Sec. 10-20.2. - Same—Public hearing. 
                  Public hearings relating to any such change shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the City of Lookout Mountain's Zoning Procedures and Standards Ordinance (Ordinance Number 289, as the same may from time to time be amended) and shall, at a minimum, include all notice and hearing requirements now or hereafter established by Georgia law, including, but not limited to, the notice and hearing requirements of the Georgia Zoning Procedures Law, Official Code of Georgia Annotated Section 36-66-1, et seq. [O.C.G.A. § 36-66-1 et seq.] 
                  Sec. 10-20.3. - Same—Standards. 
                  The standards governing the exercise of the zoning power of the City of Lookout Mountain are as set forth in the City of Lookout Mountain's Zoning Procedures and Standards Ordinance (Ordinance Number 289, as the same may from time to time be amended). Those standards govern all "Zoning Decisions" as that term is defined in the Georgia Zoning Procedures Law, including, but not limited to, amendments to the City of Lookout Mountain's zoning ordinances. 
                  Sec. 10-20.4. - Same—Fees for administrative costs. 
                  Fees for the processing of proposed amendments to this chapter or to any other zoning ordinance shall be set from time to time by the City Council and charged in accordance with the City of Lookout Mountain's Zoning Procedures and Standards Ordinance (Ordinance Number 289, as the same may from time to time be amended). 
                  Sec. 10-20.5. - Same—Incorporation of amendments into Charter. 
                  The phrase used in this chapter "at the effective date of this chapter" shall in its application to land, buildings, structures, properties and uses affected by an amendment to this chapter be read to mean "at the effective date of" the amendment containing regulations or provisions with respect to such land, buildings, structures, properties and uses. 
                  Sec. 10-21. - Enforcement, violations and penalties. 
                  Any person, firm, or corporation who violates, disobeys omits, neglects, or refuses to comply with or who resists the enforcement of any of the provisions of this chapter shall be deemed in violation of this chapter and shall be punished in accordance with Section 1-8 of the Code of Ordinances of the City. Each day a violation exists shall constitute a separate offense. 
                  It shall constitute a violation of this chapter for any person, firm or corporation, either owner or agent, to do any of the things prohibited by this chapter, including, without limitation, doing anything that can be done only pursuant to a permit, without having first obtained the permit therefor required hereby; and if any permit is issued upon a false statement of any fact which is material to the issuance thereof (established to the satisfaction of the Building Official), he shall forthwith revoke the same by notice in writing to be delivered by him to the holder of the permit upon the premises with respect to which the violation has occurred, or, if such holder is not found there, by posting the said notice of revocation in some conspicuous place upon such premises. Notice of such revocation shall also be given in writing by registered letter, return receipt requested, to the last-known address of the person complained of. Any person who shall proceed thereafter with such work or use with respect to which the permit has been revoked, without having obtained a new and additional permit in accordance with this chapter, shall he deemed guilty of violation hereof. 
                  In case any violations are discovered, the Building Official shall refer such violations to the City Council for appropriate action or proceeding at law or in equity to restrain, correct or remove such violation, or the execution of work thereon, or to restrain or correct the erection or alteration of, or to require the removal of, or to prevent the occupation or use of, the building or structure erected, constructed or altered in violation of, or not in compliance with, the provisions of this chapter or with respect to which the requirements thereof, or of any order or direction made pursuant to provisions contained therein, shall not have been complied with. 
                  Whenever, in the opinion of the Building Official, by reason of illegal work in violation of a provision or requirement of this chapter, the continuation of a building or structure operation is contrary to public welfare, he shall also refer such violation to the City Council. The Council shall thereupon order, in writing, all further work of such nature to be stopped, and may require suspension of all work on the property until the condition in violation has been corrected. 
                  The provision herein for penalties and other methods of enforcement shall not preclude the City Council, City Attorney or other proper prosecuting authority from instituting and prosecuting an appropriate action or proceeding to prevent any unlawful erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair, conversion, maintenance or use, or to restrain, correct or abate any violation, or to prevent the occupancy of any building, structure, or premises, or to prevent any illegal act, conduct, business or use in or about any premises. 
                  ARTICLE VI. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 

                  Sec. 10-22. - Severability. 
                  If any of the sections, subsections, sentences, clauses or phrases of this Ordinance are for any reason held to be unconstitutional or invalid, the validity of the remaining portions of this Ordinance shall not be affected, since it is the express intent of the Council of the City to pass each section, phrase, paragraph and word separately. 
                  Sec. 10-22.1. - Part of Code of Ordinances.
