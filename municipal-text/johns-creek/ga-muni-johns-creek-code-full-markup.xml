PREFACE 
</p>
        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE This Code constitutes a codification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Johns Creek, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section any ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves that stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Senior Code Attorney, and Karen Barrington, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Cecil G. McLendon, Jr., and Scott Hastey, Assistant City Attorneys, and Ms. Joan Jones, City Clerk, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

                  Sec. 5. - [Revenue bonds.] 
                  The authority, or any authority or body which has or which may in the future succeed to the powers, duties, and liabilities vested in the authority created by this Act, shall have power and is authorized at one time or from time to time to provide by resolution for the issuance of negotiable revenue bonds for the purpose of paying all or any part of the cost as defined in this Act of any one or more projects. The principal of and interest on such revenue bonds shall be payable solely from the special fund provided for in this Act for such payment. The bonds of each issue shall be dated and shall bear interest at such rate or rates as determined by the authority, payable on such dates as determined by the authority. The bonds shall be payable in such medium of payment as to both principal and interest as may be determined by the authority and may be made redeemable before maturity at the option of the authority at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the authority in the resolution providing for the issuance of the bonds. Such revenue bonds or obligations shall be issued pursuant to and in conformity with the "Revenue Bond Law," and all procedures pertaining to such issuance and the conditions thereof shall be the same as those contained in the "Revenue Bond Law" and any amendments thereto. 
                  Sec. 6. - [Bonds exempt from taxation.] 
                  All revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act are declared to be issued for an essential public and governmental purpose, and such bonds and the income thereof shall be exempt from all taxation by the state.

                  The authority may sell such revenue bonds in such manner and for such prices as it may determine to be for the best interest of the authority, and the proceeds derived from the sale of such bonds shall be used solely for the purpose provided in the proceedings authorizing the issuance of such bonds.

The issuance of such revenue bonds shall not directly, indirectly, or contingently obligate the state or any political subdivision thereof, specifically such city, to levy or to pledge any form of taxation whatever therefor or to make any appropriation for their payment, and all such bonds shall contain recitals on their face covering substantially the foregoing provisions of this section. However, the City of Johns Creek or any political subdivision of the state contracting with the authority may obligate itself to pay the amounts required under any contract entered into with the authority from funds received from taxes to be levied and collected for that purpose to the extent necessary to pay the obligations contractually incurred under this section and from any other source; and the obligation to make such payments shall constitute a general obligation and a pledge of the full faith and credit of the obligor but shall not constitute a debt of the obligor within the meaning of Article IX, Section V, Paragraph I of the Constitution of the State of Georgia [Georgia Constitution article IX, § V, ¶ I]. When such obligation is made to make such payments from taxes to be levied for that purpose, then the obligation shall be mandatory to levy and collect such taxes from year to year in an amount sufficient to fulfill and fully comply with the terms of such obligation. 
                  Sec. 10. - [Pledging revenues by the authority.] 
                  The revenues, rents, and earnings derived from any particular project or projects and any and all revenues, rents, and earnings received by the authority, regardless of whether such revenues, rents, and earnings were produced by a particular project for which bonds have been issued, unless otherwise pledged, may be pledged by the authority to the payment of the principal of and interest on revenue bonds of the authority as may be provided in any resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or in any trust indenture pertaining to such bonds. Such funds so pledged from whatever source received, which may include funds received from one or more or all sources, may be set aside at regular intervals into sinking funds for which provision may be made in any such resolution or trust indenture and which may be pledged to and charged with the payment of: (1) the interest upon such revenue bonds as such interest shall become due; (2) the principal of the bonds as the same shall mature; (3) the necessary charges of any trustee or agent of paying such principal and interest; and (4) any premium upon bonds retired by call or purchase. The use and disposition of any sinking fund may be subject to such regulation as may be provided for in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture securing the payment of the same. 
                  Sec. 11. - [Exercise in powers.] 
                  The exercise of the powers conferred upon the authority in this Act shall constitute an essential governmental function for a public purpose, and the authority shall be required to pay no taxes or assessments upon any of the property acquired by it or under its jurisdiction, control, possession, or supervision or upon its activities in the operation and maintenance of property acquired by it or of buildings erected or acquired by it or any fees, rentals, or other charges for the use of such property or buildings or other income received by the authority. The tax exemption provided in this Act shall not include an exemption from sales and use tax on property purchased by or for the use of the authority. 
                  Sec. 12. - [Immunity and exemptions from liability.] 
                  The authority shall have the same immunity and exemptions from liability for torts and negligence as the State of Georgia and the officers, agents, and employees of the authority, when in performance of work of the authority, shall have the same immunity from liability for torts and negligence as officers, agents, and employees of the State of Georgia. The authority may be sued the same as private corporations on any contractual obligation of the authority. 
                  Sec. 13. - [Protection and enforcement of rights.] 
                  Any action to protect or enforce any rights under the provisions of this Act or any suit or action against such authority shall be brought in the Superior Court of Fulton County and any action pertaining to the validation of any bonds issued under the provisions of this Act shall likewise be brought in that court which shall have exclusive original jurisdiction of such actions. 
                  Sec. 14. - [Confirmation and validation of bond issuance.] 
                  Bonds issued by the authority shall be confirmed and validated in accordance with the procedures of the "Revenue Bond Law." The petition for validation shall also make party defendant to such action the State of Georgia or any municipality, county, authority, political subdivision, or instrumentality of the State of Georgia or the United States government or any department or agency of the United States government, if subject to being sued and if consenting to same, which has contracted with the authority for the services and facilities of the project for which bonds are to be issued and sought to be validated, and the state or such municipality, county, authority, political subdivision, or instrumentality shall be required to show cause, if any, why such contract or contracts and the terms and conditions thereof should not be inquired into by the court and the validity of the terms thereof be determined and the contract or contracts be adjudicated as part of the basis of the security for the payment of any such bonds of the authority. The bonds, when validated, and the judgment of validation shall be final and conclusive with respect to such bonds and the security for the payment thereof and interest thereon and against the authority issuing the same, the state and any municipality, county, authority, political subdivision, or instrumentality, if a party to the validation proceedings, contracting with the authority. 
                  Sec. 15. - [Authority powers and duties for outstanding bond issues.] 
                  While any of the bonds issued by the authority remain outstanding, the powers, duties, or existence of the authority or of its officers, employees, or agents shall not be diminished or impaired in any manner that will affect adversely the interest and rights of the holders of such bonds, and no other entity, department, agency, or authority will be created which will compete with the authority to such an extent as to affect adversely the interest and rights of the holders of such bonds, nor will the state itself so compete with the authority. The provisions of this Act shall be for the benefit of the authority and the holders of any such bonds and, upon the issuance of bonds under the provisions of this Act, shall constitute a contract with the holders of such bonds. 
                  Sec. 16. - [Trust funds.] 
                  All funds received pursuant to the authority of this Act, whether as proceeds from the sale of revenue bonds or as revenue, rents, fees, charges, or other earnings or as grants, gifts, or other contributions, shall be deemed to be trust funds to be held and applied by the authority solely as provided in this Act, and the bondholders entitled to receive the benefits of such funds shall have a lien on all such funds until the same are applied as provided for in any such resolution or trust indenture of the authority. 
                  Sec. 17. - [Authorization to appoint, select, and employ.]

                  This Act and any other law enacted with reference to the City of Johns Creek Parks and Recreation Authority shall be liberally construed for the accomplishment of the purposes of the authority. 
                  Sec. 19. - [Dissolution of authority.] 
                  Should the authority for any reason be dissolved after full payment of all bonded indebtedness incurred under the provisions of this Act, both as to principal and interest, title to all property of any kind and nature, real and personal, held by the authority at the time of such dissolution shall be conveyed to the City of Johns Creek; or title to any such property may be conveyed prior to such dissolution in accordance with provisions which may be made therefor in any resolution or trust indenture relating to such property, subject to any liens, leases, or other encumbrances outstanding against or in respect to said property at the time of such conveyance. 
                  Sec. 20. - [Laws in conflict with Act.]

                  Sec. 15. - To whom proceeds of bonds shall be paid. 
                  In the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, the authority shall provide for the payment of the proceeds of the sale of the revenue bonds to any officer or person who, or any agency, bank, or trust company which, shall act as trustee of such funds and shall hold and apply the same to the purposes thereof, subject to such regulations as this Act and such resolution or trust indenture may provide.

                  (5)  The necessary charges of the paying agent for paying principal and interest. 
                  The use and disposition of such sinking fund shall be subject to such regulations as may be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, but, except as may otherwise be provided in such resolution or trust indenture, such sinking fund shall be maintained as a trust account for the benefit of all revenue bonds without distinction or priority of one over another. 
                  Sec. 17. - Remedies of bondholders. 
                  Any holder of revenue bonds or any of the coupons appertaining thereto, and the trustee under the trust indenture, if any, except to the extent the rights herein given may be restricted by resolution passed before the issuance of the revenue bonds or by the trust indenture, may, either at law or in equity, by suit, action, mandamus, or other proceedings, protect and enforce any and all rights under the laws of this state, including specifically, but without limitation, the Revenue Bond Law, or granted hereunder or under such resolution or trust indenture, and may enforce and compel performance of all duties required by this Act or by such resolution or trust indenture to be performed by the authority or any officer thereof, including the fixing, charging, and collecting of revenues, fees, tolls, fines, and other charges for the use of the facilities and services furnished. 
                  Sec. 18. - Validation.

The revenue bonds, when validated, and the judgment of validation shall be final and conclusive with respect to such revenue bonds and the security for the payment thereof and interest thereon and against the authority and all other defendants. 
                  Sec. 19. - Venue and jurisdiction.

                  (a)  When the purchasing agent determines, in writing, that the use of the competitive sealed bid is either not practical or not advantageous to the city, a contract may be entered into by use of the competitive sealed proposal.

                  The multistep competitive sealed procurement method may be used when the city desires to award a contract not necessarily based on price, and when specifications may not be readily available or when technical qualifications are essential for the decision making process. This type shall take the form of request for proposals or request for information and shall follow the following format. If time is of the essence, the two steps can be combined with the priced offer submitted in a separate sealed envelope at the time of submission of the technical offer. The pricing data is to remain unopened until evaluation of technical offers is complete. 
                  (1)  The solicitation shall be advertised in a newspaper having general circulation in the city.

The record and the proposals received shall be subject to public inspection after the proposal opening in the manner prescribed by law. 
                  (5)  Award of proposal shall be made to the bidder that submits the lowest responsible and responsive proposal that meets the specifications contained in the proposal documents and is in the city's best interest. The city reserves the right to make award if a single proposal is received. 
                  (6)  If required by the soliciting documents, the purchasing agent may require the successful contracting party to furnish a payment and performance bond to secure the faithful performance of all of the terms of the contract. The payment and performance bond shall be in a form approved by the city attorney and the form of the bond shall be included in the specifications. 
                  (7)  All contracts of $25,000.00 or more to which this section applies shall be in writing and shall be approved by the city council. The city council may reject any and all bids.

                  (b)  The purchasing agent shall have the authority to transfer surplus stock to other using agencies. 
                  (c)  The purchasing agent shall have the authority to sell all supplies which have become unsuitable for public use, or to exchange the same for, or trade in the same on, new supplies, upon approval of the city manager. 
                  (d)  The purchasing agent may dispose of all personal property of the city in a manner consistent with this section and the city's adopted purchasing policy. Competitive bids shall be encouraged to the extent possible.

                  (b)  Upon the filing of a complaint, within three working days, the city manager shall request a response from the city purchasing agent within 30 days. Failure of the city purchasing director to file a response may be considered as evidence by the city manager. 
                  (c)  If requested by either party, the city manager or his designee shall have a hearing on the complaint and decide the merits of the claim. The city manager is empowered to decide that the contract at issue be voided, upheld, or whatever other relief may be necessary. The city council shall approve or reject the city manager's decision. 
                  (d)  If the party bringing the complaint disagrees with the conclusions of the city manager and council, the decision may be appealed to the county superior court.

                  Sec. 18-40. - Purpose and intent. 
                  (a)  The purpose of this division is to encourage alarm owners and alarm businesses to properly use and maintain the operational effectiveness of alarm systems in order to improve the reliability of alarm systems and reduce or eliminate false alarms.

The written notice of appeal shall contain the cause for the appeal and any other pertinent information relevant to the case. The failure to give notice of appeal within this time period shall constitute a waiver of the right to contest the assessment of penalties or other enforcement decisions. The police chief and fire chief shall each respectively designate a hearing officer from the police department and the fire department to hear appeals related to their agency. The respective hearing officer shall render a decision within five business days and give written notification of his/her decision. The hearing officer's decision may be appealed to the respective chief by filing a written notice of appeal within ten days of the decision of the hearing officer. The respective chief shall have the final decision in this matter.

                  (b)  Appeal standard.

An appeal must be in writing, stating the reasons why the order to disconnect or deactivate should be withdrawn. The appeals shall be made within 15 days after notice to disconnect is mailed to the owner. The fire department hearing officer or his designee shall review the facts and circumstances and shall determine whether the owner has shown good cause why the order should be withdrawn. If the hearing officer affirms the order to disconnect or deactivate a fire alarm system, the owner shall have 15 days after the written decision is mailed to the owner to comply with the order. The appeal of an order to disconnect or deactivate shall suspend the effective date of the order until the appeal has been acted upon by the hearing officer. 
                  (d)  Responsibility for fees/costs. In the event the appeal is not upheld, the owner or fire alarm business shall also be responsible for any fee assessed to reimburse the city for any costs incurred by the hearing officer in enforcing this division.

                  (b)  Governmental immunity. Alarm registration is not intended to, nor will it, create a contract, duty or obligation, either express or implied, of response. Any and all liability and consequential damages resulting from the failure to respond to a notification is hereby disclaimed and governmental immunity as provided by law is retained. By applying for an alarm system registration, the alarm user acknowledges that the police department and fire department response may be influenced by various factors, including, without limitation, the availability of responding units, priority of calls, weather conditions, traffic conditions, emergency conditions, staffing levels and prior response history. 
                  (c)  Severability. The provisions of this division are severable. If a court determines that a word, phrase, clause, sentence, paragraph, subsection, section, or other provision is invalid or that the application of any part of the provision to any person or circumstance is invalid, the remaining provisions and the application of those provisions to other persons or circumstances are not affected by that decision.

                  Editor's note— Ord. No. 2014-07-27, adopted July 14, 2014, repealed the former article III, §§ 22-46—22-56, and enacted a new article III as set out herein. The former article III pertained to similar subject matter. See Code Comparative Table for complete derivation. 
                  State Law reference— Georgia Massage Therapy Practice Act, O.C.G.A. § 43-24A-1 et seq.; local regulation of massage, O.C.G.A. § 43-24A-22. 

                  Sec. 22-46. - Purpose and legislative findings. 
                  The Georgia General Assembly has declared that the practice of massage therapy is an activity affecting the public interest and involving the health, safety, and welfare of the public and that the practice of massage therapy by a person who is not licensed under the Georgia Massage Therapy Practice Act (O.C.G.A. §§ 43-24A-1, et seq.) is a public nuisance, harmful to the public health, safety, and welfare. The city council agrees with those findings. Furthermore, the city council finds that, for many massage establishments, the business in fact is sexual conduct or the intimation of sexual conduct, rather than lawful massage therapy. Such establishments offer massage services as a subterfuge for prostitution, masturbation for hire, and other paid sexual contact, which are harmful to the public health, safety, and welfare. There is difficulty and expense in conclusively distinguishing between such establishments and legitimate massage establishments, but one rational distinction is whether the establishment has a relationship with a corporate or franchising hierarchy, which would tend to safeguard against unlawful sexual activities on the massage establishment premises. It is a purpose of this article to impose licensing requirements to help prevent illegal massage, prostitution, and related sex crimes, yet without hindering legitimate massage establishments operating under a business structure with external oversight that serves that purpose. Pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 43-24A-22 (allowing local regulation of massage businesses and of persons not licensed by the state), it is the purpose of this article to regulate the operation of massage establishments and spa establishments, and to regulate employees of such establishments who are not licensed as massage therapists by the state, as an exercise of the city's police power in order to protect the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of the city.

Within 30 days of the filing of a completed massage/spa establishment work permit application, the city manager or his or her designee shall either issue a work permit to the applicant or issue a written notice of intent to deny the work permit to the applicant. The city manager or his or her designee shall issue the work permit unless:

                  (e)  The work permit, if issued, will be valid for a period of one year from the date it is issued. Replacement and additional work permit(s) shall be issued upon payment of one-half of the fee charged for a work permit and will expire the same date as the then-current work permit. A massage establishment or spa establishment employee shall provide the employee's work permit to the establishment for which it was issued to be posted on the premises pursuant to this article.

                  Sec. 22-232. - Rationale and findings. 
                  (a)  Purpose. It is the purpose of this article to regulate sexually oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, moral, and general welfare of the citizens of the city, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses within the city. The provisions of this article have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content or reasonable access to any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is neither the intent nor effect of this article to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this article to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material. 
                  (b)  Rationale and findings.

                  And based upon reports concerning secondary effects occurring in and around sexually oriented businesses, including, but not limited to, Austin, Texas-1986: Indianapolis, Indiana-1984; Garden Grove, California-1991; Houston, Texas-1983, 1997; Phoenix, Arizona-1979, 1995-98; Chattanooga, Tennessee-1999-2003; Los Angeles, California-1977; Whittier, California-1978; Spokane, Washington-2001; St. Cloud, Minnesota-1994; Littleton, Colorado-2004; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma-1986; Dallas, Texas-1997; Montrose, Illinois-2005; Kennedale, Texas-2005; American Planning Association—2001; Greensboro, North Carolina-2003; Amarillo, Texas-1977; New York, New York Times Square-1994; and the Report of the Attorney General's Working Group On The Regulation Of Sexually Oriented Businesses (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota); 
                  the city council finds: 
                  (1)  Sexually oriented businesses, as a category of commercial uses, are associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects, including, but not limited to, personal and property crimes, prostitution, potential spread of disease, lewdness, public indecency, obscenity, illicit drug use and drug trafficking, negative impacts on surrounding properties, urban blight, litter, and sexual assault and exploitation. 
                  (2)  Sexually oriented businesses should be separated from sensitive land uses to minimize the impact of their secondary effects upon such uses, and should be separated from other sexually oriented businesses, to minimize the secondary effects associated with such uses and to prevent an unnecessary concentration of sexually oriented businesses in one area. 
                  (3)  Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm which the city has a substantial government interest in preventing and/or abating. This substantial government interest in preventing secondary effects, which is the city's rationale for this article, exists independent of any comparative analysis between sexually oriented and non-sexually-oriented businesses. Additionally, the city's interest in regulating sexually oriented businesses extends to preventing future secondary effects of either current or future sexually oriented businesses that may locate in the city. The city finds that the cases and documentation relied on in this article are reasonably believed to be relevant to said secondary effects.

If the act required of the city official under this article, and not completed in the time prescribed, includes approval of conditions necessary for approval by the city of an applicant or licensee's application for sexually oriented business license or a sexually oriented business employee's license (including a renewal), the license shall be deemed granted and the business or employee allowed to commence operations or employment the day after the deadline for the city's action has passed.

                  (a)  It shall be unlawful to establish, operate, or cause to be operated a sexually oriented business in the city, unless said sexually oriented business is at least:

                  (b)  Measurement. For the purpose of this section, measurements shall be made in a straight line in all directions without regard to intervening structures or objects, from the closest point on a boundary line of the sexually oriented business parcel to the closest point on a boundary line of any parcel containing a house of worship, public or private elementary or secondary school, public park, residence, another sexually oriented business, or a business licensed by the state to sell alcohol on the premises.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Code, a nonconforming sexually oriented business, lawfully existing in all respects under law prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, may continue to operate for one year following that date in order to make a reasonable recoupment of its investment in its current location. At the conclusion of said one year, the use will no longer be recognized as a lawful nonconforming use, except that a nonconforming sexually oriented business may obtain an extension of the original one-year period upon a showing of financial hardship. An application for an extension based upon financial hardship ("hardship exception") shall be made at least 60 days before the conclusion of the aforementioned one-year period. 
                  (d)  Procedure for seeking hardship extension.

Within ten days after receiving the application, the city clerk shall schedule a hearing on the application before the hearing officer, which hearing shall be conducted within 30 days after the city clerk's receipt of the application. Notice of the time and place of such hearing shall be provided to the applicant via certified mail at least ten days before the hearing.

                  (e)  The hearing officer shall issue a written decision within ten days after the hearing on the application for a hardship extension. The hardship extension shall be granted upon a showing of financial hardship. Such a showing shall be established if the hearing officer makes the following findings: 
                  (1)  The applicant has, prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, made a substantial investment, including but not limited to lease obligations incurred in an arms-length transaction, in the property or structure on or in which the nonconforming use is conducted; 
                  (2)  The applicant will be unable to recoup said investment as of the date established for termination of the use; and 
                  (3)  The applicant has made good faith efforts to recoup the investment prior to the conclusion of the one-year period. 
                  (f)  Any extension granted under the provisions of this section shall be for a reasonable period of time commensurate with the investment involved.

                  (a)  It is the duty of the owner of every dwelling, building, structure or property within the jurisdiction to construct and maintain such dwelling, building, structure or property in conformance with applicable codes in force within the city, or such ordinances which regulate and prohibit activities on property and which declare it to be a public nuisance to construct or maintain any dwelling, building, structure or property in violation of such codes or ordinances.

If the officer's investigation or inspection identifies that any dwelling, building, structure, or property is unfit for human habitation or for commercial, industrial or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the public officer may issue a complaint in rem against the lot, tract or parcel of real property on which such dwelling, building or structure is situated or where such public health hazard or general nuisance exists and shall cause summons and a copy of the complaint to be served on the owner and interested parties in such dwelling, building or structure. The complaint shall identify the subject real property by appropriate street address and official tax map reference, identify the owner and the interested parties, state with particularity the factual basis for the action and contain a statement of the action sought by the public officer to abate the alleged nuisance. The summons shall notify the owner and interested parties that a hearing will be held before the municipal court at a date and time certain and at a place within the city where the property is located.

                  (3)  For purposes of this article, the court shall make its determination of reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building or structure without consideration of the value of the land on which the structure is situated; provided, however, that costs of the preparation necessary to repair, alter or improve a structure may be considered. Income and financial status of the owner shall not be a factor in the court's determination. The present value of the structure and the costs of repair, alteration or improvement may be established by affidavits of real estate appraisers with a state appraiser classification as provided in O.C.G.A. title 43, ch. 39A (O.C.G.A. § 43-39A-1 et seq.), qualified building contractors or qualified building inspectors without actual testimony presented; or 
                  (4)  Costs of repair, alteration or improvement of the structure shall be the cost necessary to bring the structure into compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violations in force in the jurisdiction. 
                  (e)  If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair or demolish the dwelling, building or structure, the public officer may cause such dwelling, building or structure to be repaired, altered or improved, to be vacated and closed, or to be demolished. The public officer shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of the building, dwelling or structure a placard with the following words: 
                  "This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business use and does not comply with the applicable codes or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with drug crimes or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful." 
                  (f)  If the public officer has the structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any moneys received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. The public officer and the city are relieved of any and all liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials. 
                  (g)  The amount of the cost of demolition, including all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the tax commissioner and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, including restoration to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred. 
                  (h)  The lien provided for in subsection (g) of this section shall attach to the real property upon the filing of a certified copy of the order requiring repair, closure or demolition in the office of the clerk of superior court in the county and shall relate back to the date of this filing of the lis pendens notice required under O.C.G.A. § 41-2-12(c). The clerk of superior court shall record and index such certified copy of the order in the deed records of the county and enter the lien on the general execution docket. The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except liens for taxes to which the lien shall be inferior, and shall continue in force until paid. After filing a certified copy of the order with the clerk of superior court, the public officer shall forward a copy of the order and a final statement of costs to the county tax commissioner. It shall be the duty of the county tax commissioner to collect the amount of the lien in conjunction with the collection of ad valorem taxes on the property and to collect the amount of the lien as if it were a real property ad valorem tax, using all methods available for collecting real property ad valorem taxes, including specifically O.C.G.A. title 48, ch. 4 (O.C.G.A. § 48-4-1 et seq.); provided, however, that the limitation of O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 which requires 12 months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure shall not apply. The county tax commissioner shall collect and enforce municipal liens imposed pursuant to this chapter in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 48-5-359.1. The tax commissioner shall remit the amount collected to the governing authority of the city. 
                  (i)  The tax commissioner shall collect and retain an amount equal to the cost of administering a lien authorized by O.C.G.A. § 41-2-7 et seq. unless such costs are waived by resolution of the county. Any such amount collected and retained for administration shall be deposited in the general fund of the county to pay the cost of administering the lien. 
                  (j)  The city may waive and release any such lien imposed on property upon the owner of such property entering into a contract with the city agreeing to a timetable for rehabilitation of the real property of the dwelling, building or structure on the property and demonstrating the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation. 
                  (k)  Where the abatement action does not commence in the superior court, review of a court order requiring the repair, alteration, improvement or demolition of a dwelling, building or structure shall be by direct appeal to the superior court under O.C.G.A. § 5-3-29. 
                  (l)  The public officers designated herein may issue citations for violations of state minimum standard codes, optional building, fire, life safety and other codes adopted by ordinance and conditions creating a public health hazard or general nuisance, and may seek to enforce such citation in a court of competent jurisdiction prior to issuing a complaint in rem as provided in this article. 
                  (m)  Nothing in this article shall be construed to impair or limit in any way the power of the city to define and declare nuisances and to cause their removal or abatement by summary proceedings or otherwise.

                  (a)  A person commits the offense of distributing obscene material when he sells, lends, rents, leases, gives, advertises, publishes, exhibits or otherwise disseminates to any person any obscene material of any description, knowing the obscene nature thereof, or offers to do so, or possesses such material with the intent to do so, provided that the term "knowing," as used in this section, shall be deemed to be either actual or constructive knowledge of the obscene contents of the subject matter, and a person has constructive knowledge of the obscene contents if he has knowledge of facts which would put a reasonable and prudent person on notice as to the suspect nature of the material; provided, however, that the character and reputation of the individual charged with an offense under this law, and, if a commercial dissemination of obscene material is involved, the character and reputation of the business establishment involved may be placed in evidence by the defendant on the question of intent to violate this law. Undeveloped photographs, molds, printing plates and the like shall be deemed obscene notwithstanding that processing or other acts may be required to make the obscenity patent or to disseminate it. 
                  (b)  Material is obscene if: 
                  (1)  To the average person, applying contemporary community standards, taken as a whole, it predominantly appeals to the prurient interest, that is, a shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sex or excretion; 
                  (2)  The material taken as a whole lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value; or 
                  (3)  The material depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically as: 
                  a.  Acts of sexual intercourse, heterosexual or homosexual, normal or perverted, actual or simulated; 
                  b.  Acts of masturbation; 
                  c.  Acts involving excretory functions or lewd exhibition of the genitals; 
                  d.  Acts of bestiality or the fondling of sex organs of animals; or 
                  e.  Sexual acts of flagellation, torture or other violence indicating a sadomasochistic sexual relationship. 
                  (c)  Any device designed or marketed as useful primarily for the stimulation of human genital organs is obscene material under this section. 
                  (d)  Material not otherwise obscene may be obscene under this section if the distribution thereof, the offer to do so or the possession with the intent to do so is a commercial exploitation of erotica solely for the sake of their prurient appeal. 
                  (e)  It is an affirmative defense under this section that selling, lending, renting, leasing, giving, advertising, publishing, exhibiting or otherwise disseminating the material was restricted to: 
                  (1)  A person associated with an institution of higher learning, either as a member of the faculty or a matriculated student, teaching or pursuing a course of study related to such material; or 
                  (2)  A person whose receipt of such material was authorized in writing by a licensed medical practitioner or psychiatrist. 
                  (f)  A person who commits the offense of distributing obscene material shall be punished as provided in section 1-7.

                  Each company shall agree to indemnify, defend and save harmless the city, its agents, officers and employees, against and from any and all claims by or on behalf of any person, firm, corporation or other entity arising from any negligent act or omission or willful misconduct of the company, or any of its agents, contractors, servants, employees or sub-contractors, and from and against all costs, counsel fees, expenses and liabilities incurred in or about any such claim or proceeding brought thereon. Promptly after receipt from any third party by city of a written notice of any demand, claim or circumstance that, immediately or with the lapse of time, would give rise to a claim or the commencement (or threatened commencement) of any action, proceeding or investigation (an "asserted claim") that may result in losses for which indemnification may be sought hereunder, the city shall give written notice thereof (the "claims notice") to the company provided, however, that a failure to give such notice shall not prejudice the city's right to indemnification hereunder except to the extent that the company is actually and materially prejudiced thereby. The claims notice shall describe the asserted claim in reasonable detail, and shall indicate the amount (estimated, if necessary) of the losses that have been or may be suffered by the city when such information is available. The company may elect to compromise or defend, at its own expense and by its own counsel, any asserted claim. If the company elects to compromise or defend such asserted claim, it shall, within 20 business days following its receipt of the claims notice (or sooner, if the nature of the asserted claim so required) notify the city of its intent to do so, and the city shall cooperate, at the expense of the company, in the compromise of, or defense against, such asserted claim. If the company elects not to compromise or defend the asserted claim, fails to notify the city of its election as herein provided or contests its obligation to provide indemnification under this agreement, the city may pay, compromise or defend such asserted claim with all reasonable costs and expenses borne by the company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the company nor the city may settle or compromise any claim without the consent of the other party; provided, however, that such consent to settlement or compromise shall not be unreasonably withheld. In any event, the city and the company may participate at their own expense, in the defense of such asserted claim. If the company chooses to defend any asserted claim, the city shall make available to the company any books, records or other documents within its control that are necessary or appropriate for such defense.

                  (5)  Time limitations. An application for a permit for any proposed work shall be deemed to have been abandoned six months after the date of filing for the permit, unless before then a permit has been issued. One or more extensions of time for periods of not more than 90 days each may be allowed by the building official for the application, provided the extension is requested in writing and justifiable cause is demonstrated. 
                  (b)  Drawings and specifications. 
                  (1)  Requirements. When required by the building official, two or more copies of specifications and of drawings drawn to scale with sufficient clarity and detail to indicate the nature and character of the work, shall accompany the application for a permit. Such drawings and specifications shall contain information, in the form of notes or otherwise, as to the quality of materials, where quality is essential to conformity with the construction codes. Such information shall be specific, and the construction codes shall not be cited as a whole or in part, nor shall the term "legal" or its equivalent be used, as a substitute for specific information. All information, drawings, specifications and accompanying data shall bear the name and signature of the person responsible for the design. 
                  (2)  Additional data.

                  b.  Single-family dwellings, regardless of size, shall require neither a registered architect or engineer, nor a certification that an architect or engineer is not required. 
                  (4)  Structural and fire resistance integrity. Plans for all buildings shall indicate how required structural and fire resistance integrity will be maintained where a penetration of a required fire resistance wall, floor, or partition will be made for electrical, gas, mechanical, plumbing, signal and communication conduits, pipes, and systems and also indicate in sufficient detail how the fire integrity will be maintained where required fire resistance floors intersect the exterior walls. 
                  (5)  Site drawings. Drawings shall show the location of the proposed building or structure and of every existing building or structure on the site or lot. The building official may require a boundary line survey prepared by a qualified surveyor. 
                  (6)  Hazardous occupancies. The building official may require the following: 
                  a.  General site plan. A general site plan, drawn at a legible scale, which shall include, but not be limited to, the location of all buildings, exterior storage facilities, permanent accessways, evacuation routes, parking lots, internal roads, chemical loading areas, equipment cleaning areas, storm and sanitary sewer accesses, emergency equipment, and adjacent property uses.

Each hazardous materials storage facility shall be identified on the plan with the hazard classes and quantity range per hazard class or the hazardous materials stored. 
                  (c)  Examination of documents. 
                  (1)  Plan review. The building official shall examine or cause to be examined each application for a permit and the accompanying documents, consisting of drawings, specifications, computations, and additional data, and shall ascertain by such examinations whether the construction indicated and described is in accordance with the requirements of the construction codes and all other pertinent laws or ordinances. 
                  (d)  Issuing permits. 
                  (1)  Action on permits. The building official shall act upon an application for a permit without unreasonable or unnecessary delay. If the building official is satisfied that the work described in an application for a permit and the contract documents filed therewith conform to the requirements of the construction codes and other pertinent laws and ordinances, he shall issue a permit to the applicant. 
                  (2)  Refusal to issue permit. If the application for a permit and the accompanying contract documents describing the work do not conform to the requirements of the construction codes or other pertinent laws or ordinances, the building official shall not issue a permit, but shall return the contract documents to the applicant with his refusal to issue such permit. Such refusal shall, when requested, be in writing and shall contain the reason for refusal. 
                  (3)  Special foundation permit. When application for permit to erect or enlarge a building has been filed and pending issuance of such permit, the building official may, at his discretion, issue a special permit for the foundation only. The holder of such a special permit is proceeding at his own risk and without assurance that a permit for the remainder of the work will be granted nor that corrections will not be required in order to meet provisions of the construction codes. 
                  (4)  Public right-of-way. A permit shall not be given by the building official for the construction of any building, or for the alteration of any building where said building is to be changed and such change will affect the exterior walls, bays, balconies, or other appendages or projections fronting on any street, alley, or public lane, or for the placing on any lot or premises of any building or structure removed from another lot or premises, unless the applicant has made application at the office of the director of public works for the lines of the public street on which he proposes to build, erect, or locate said building; and it shall be the duty of the building official to see that the street lines are not encroached upon. 
                  (e)  Contractor responsibilities. It shall be the duty of every contractor who shall make contracts for the installation or repairs of buildings, structures, electrical, gas, mechanical, sprinkler, or plumbing systems, for which a permit is required, to comply with state or local rules and regulations concerning licensing which the applicable governing authority may have adopted. In such case that the state requires a contractor to have obtained a state license before they are permitted to perform work, the contractor shall supply the local government with its license number before receiving a permit for work to be performed. 
                  (f)  Conditions of the permit. 
                  (1)  Intent. A permit issued shall be construed to be a license to proceed with the work and not as authority to violate, cancel, alter, or set aside any of the provisions of the construction codes, nor shall issuance of a permit prevent the building official from thereafter requiring a correction of errors in plans, construction, or violations of the construction codes. Every permit issued shall become invalid unless the work authorized by such permit is commenced within six months after its issuance, or if the work authorized by such permit is suspended or abandoned for a period of six months after the time the worked is commenced. One or more extensions of time, for periods not more than 90 days each, may be allowed for the permit. The extension shall be requested in writing and justifiable cause demonstrated. Extensions shall be in writing by the building official. 
                  (2)  Issued on basis of an affidavit. Whenever the work to be covered by a permit involves installation under conditions which, in the opinion of the building official, are hazardous or complex, the building official shall require that the architect or engineer who prepared the drawings or computations shall supervise such work. In addition, they shall be responsible for conformity with the permit, provide copies of inspection reports as inspections are performed, and upon completion make and file with the building official written affidavit that the work has been done in conformity with the reviewed plans and with the structural provisions of the construction codes. In the event such architect or engineer is not available, the owner shall employ in his place, a competent person or agency whose qualifications are reviewed by the building official. 
                  (3)  Plans. When the building official issues a permit, he shall endorse, in writing or by stamp, both sets of plans "reviewed for code compliance." One set of drawings so reviewed shall be retained by the building official and the other set shall be returned to the applicant. The permitted drawings shall be kept at the site of work and shall be open to inspection by the building official or his authorized representative. 
                  (g)  Fees. 
                  (1)  Prescribed fees. A permit shall not be issued until the fees prescribed by the city council have been paid. Nor shall an amendment to a permit be released until the additional fee, if any, due to an increase in the estimated cost of the building, structure, electrical, plumbing, mechanical, or gas systems, etc., has been paid. 
                  (2)  Work commencing before permit issuance. Any person who commences any work on a building, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical, or plumbing, etc., system before obtaining the necessary permits shall be subject to a penalty of 100 percent of the usual permit fee in addition to the required permit fees. 
                  (3)  Accounting. The building official shall keep a permanent and accurate accounting of all permit fees and other money collected, the names of all persons upon whose account the same was paid, along with the date and amount thereof. 
                  (4)  Schedule of permit fees. On all buildings, structures, electrical, plumbing, mechanical, and gas systems or alterations requiring a permit, a fee for each permit shall be paid as required at the time of filing application, in accordance with the fee schedules as set by the city council. 
                  (5)  Building permit valuations. If, in the opinion of the building official, the valuation of building, alteration, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical, or plumbing systems appears to be underestimated on the application, the permit shall be denied, unless the applicant can show detailed estimates to meet the approval of the building official. Permit valuations shall include total cost, such as electrical, gas, mechanical, plumbing equipment, and other systems, including materials and labor. 
                  (h)  Inspections. 
                  (1)  Existing building inspections. Before issuing a permit, the building official may examine or cause to be examined any building, electrical, gas, mechanical, or plumbing systems for which an application has been received for a permit to enlarge, alter, repair, move, demolish, install, or change the occupancy. He shall inspect all buildings, structures, electrical, gas, mechanical, and plumbing systems, from time to time, during and upon completion of the work for which a permit was issued. He shall make a record of every such examination and inspection and of all violations of the construction codes. 
                  (2)  Manufacturers and fabricators. When deemed necessary by the building official, he shall make, or cause to be made, an inspection of materials or assemblies at the point of manufacture or fabrication. A record shall be made of every such examination and inspection and of all violations of the construction codes. 
                  (3)  Inspection service. The building official may make, or cause to be made, the inspections required by subsection (h)(6) of this section. He may accept reports of inspectors of recognized inspection services provided that after investigation he/she is satisfied as to their qualifications and reliability. A certificate called for by any provision of the construction codes shall not be based on such reports unless the same are in writing and certified by a responsible officer of such service. 
                  (4)  Inspections prior to issuance of certificate of occupancy or completion.

Work shall not be done on any part of a building, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical, or plumbing system beyond the point indicated in each successive inspection without first obtaining a written release from the building official. Such written release shall be given only after an inspection has been made of each successive step in the construction or installation as indicated by each of the foregoing three inspections. 
                  (8)  Reinforcing steel, structural frames, insulation, plumbing, mechanical, or electrical systems. Reinforcing steel, structural frame, insulation, plumbing, work of any part of any building or structure shall not be covered or concealed without first obtaining a release from the building official. 
                  (9)  Plaster fire protection. In all buildings where plaster is used for fire protection purposes, the permit holder or his agent shall notify the building official after all lathing and backing is in place. Plaster shall not be applied until the release from the building official has been received. 
                  (i)  Certificates. 
                  (1)  Certificate of occupancy. 
                  a.  Building occupancy. A new building shall not be occupied or a change made in the occupancy, nature, or use of a building or part of a building until after the building official has issued a certificate of occupancy. Said certificate shall not be issued until all required electrical, gas, mechanical, plumbing, and fire protection systems have been inspected for compliance with the construction codes and other applicable laws and ordinances and released by the building official. 
                  b.  Issuance of certificate. Upon satisfactory completion of construction of a building or structure and installation of electrical, gas, mechanical, and plumbing systems in accordance with the construction codes, reviewed plans and specifications, and after the final inspection, the building official shall issue a certificate of occupancy stating the nature of the occupancy permitted, the number of persons for each floor when limited by law, and the allowable load per square foot for each floor in accordance with the provisions of the construction codes. 
                  c.  Temporary/partial occupancy. A temporary/partial certificate of occupancy may be issued for a portion of a commercial building, which in the opinion of the building official may safely be occupied prior to final completion of the building. The temporary/partial certificate of occupancy shall be forfeited if the permanent certificate of occupancy is not issued within 90 days. 
                  d.  Existing building occupancy. A certificate of occupancy for any existing building may be obtained by applying to the building official and supplying the information and data necessary to determine compliance with the construction codes for the occupancy intended. Where necessary, in the opinion of the building official, two sets of detailed drawings or a general inspection, or both, may be required. When, upon examination and inspection, it is found that the building conforms to the provisions of the construction codes and other applicable laws and ordinances for such occupancy, a certificate of occupancy shall be issued. 
                  (2)  Certificate of completion. Upon satisfactory completion of a building, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical, or plumbing system, a certificate of completion may be issued. This certificate is proof that a structure or system is complete and for certain types of permits is released for use and may be connected to a utility system. This certificate does not grant authority to occupy or connect a building, such as a shell building, prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. 
                  (3)  Service utilities. 
                  a.  Connection. No person shall make connections from a utility, source of energy, fuel, or power to any building or system which is regulated by the construction codes for which a permit is required, until released by the building official and a certificate of occupancy or completion is issued. 
                  b.  Temporary connection. The building official may authorize the temporary connection of the building or system to the utility source of energy, fuel, or power for the purpose of testing building service systems or for use under a temporary certificate of occupancy. 
                  c.  Authority to disconnect. The building official shall have the power to authorize disconnection of utility service to the building, structure, or system regulated by the construction codes, in case of emergency where necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to life or property. The building official shall notify the serving utility, and whenever possible the owner and occupant of the building, structure, or service system of the decision to disconnect prior to taking such action. If not notified prior to disconnecting, the owner or occupant of the building, structure, or service system shall be notified in writing, as soon as practical thereafter. 
                  (j)  Posting floor loads. 
                  (1)  Occupancy. An existing or new building shall not be occupied for any purpose, which will cause the floors thereof to be loaded beyond their safe capacity. The building official may permit occupancy of a building for mercantile, commercial, or industrial purposes, by a specific business, when he is satisfied that such capacity will not thereby be exceeded. 
                  (2)  Storage and factory-industrial occupancies. It shall be the responsibility of the owner, agent, proprietor, or occupant of Group S and Group F occupancies, or any occupancy where excessive floor loading is likely to occur, to employ a competent architect or engineer in computing the safe load capacity. All such computations shall be accompanied by an affidavit from the architect or engineer stating the safe allowable floor load on each floor in pounds per square foot uniformly distributed. The computations and affidavit shall be filed as a permanent record of the building department. 
                  (3)  Signs required. In every building or part of a building used for storage, industrial, or hazardous purposes, the safe floor loads, as reviewed by the building official on the plan, shall be marked on plates or approved design which shall be supplied and securely affixed by the owner of the building in a conspicuous place in each story to which they relate. Such plates shall not be removed or defaced, and if lost, removed or defaced, shall be replaced by the owner of the building.

                  Sec. 109-19. - General provisions. 
                  (a)  Purpose and intent. Article IX, subsection II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a) have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, [the] City of Johns Creek, Georgia, does ordain this article and establishes this set of floodplain management and flood hazard reduction provisions for the purpose of regulating the use of flood hazard areas. It is determined that the regulation of flood hazard areas and the prevention of flood damage are in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety, as well as to private and public property. 
                  The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in flood hazard areas, as well as to protect the beneficial uses of floodplain areas for water quality protection, streambank and stream corridor protection, wetlands preservation, and ecological and environmental protection by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to flooding or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)  Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
                  (4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; 
                  (5)  Limit the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; and 
                  (6)  Protect the stormwater management, water quality, streambank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation, and ecological functions of natural floodplain areas. 
                  (b)  Applicability. This article shall be applicable to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of Johns Creek, Georgia. 
                  (c)  Designation of ordinance administrator. The director or his/her designee is hereby appointed to administer and implement the provisions of this article. 
                  (d)  Basis for establishing areas of special flood hazard, areas of future-conditions flood hazard and associated floodplain characteristics—Flood area maps and studies. For the purposes of defining and determining "Areas of Special Flood Hazard," "Areas of Future-conditions Flood Hazard," "Areas of Shallow Flooding," "Base Flood Elevations," "Floodplains," "Floodways," "Future-conditions Flood Elevations," "Future-conditions Floodplains," potential flood hazard or risk categories as shown on FIRM maps, and other terms used in this article, the following documents and sources may be used for such purposes and are adopted by reference thereto: 
                  (1)  The flood insurance study (FIS) for Fulton County dated June, 18, 2010 with accompanying maps and other supporting data and any revision thereto. 
                  (2)  Other studies which may be relied upon for the establishment of the base flood elevation or delineation of the base or one-percent (100-year) floodplain and flood-prone areas including: 
                  a.  Any flood or flood-related study conducted by the United States Corps of Engineers, the United States Geological Survey, or any other local, state or federal agency applicable to the city; and 
                  b.  Any base flood study conducted by a licensed professional engineer which has been prepared by utilizing FEMA approved methodology and approved by the city. 
                  c.  Base flood elevation data are required for all proposed subdivision and other developments greater than or equal to 50 lots or five acres within or adjacent to A-zones. 
                  (3)  Other studies which may be relied upon for the establishment of the future-conditions flood elevation or delineation of the future-conditions floodplain and floodprone areas including: 
                  a.  Any flood or flood-related study conducted by the United States Corps of Engineers, the United States Geological Survey, or any other local, state, or federal agency applicable to the city; and 
                  b.  Any future-conditions flood study conducted by a licensed professional engineer which has been prepared utilizing FEMA approved methodology approved by the city. 
                  (4)  The repository for public inspection of the FIS, accompanying maps and other supporting data is located at city hall. 
                  (e)  Compatibility with other regulations. This article is not intended to modify or repeal any other ordinance, rule, regulation, statute, easement, covenant, deed restriction or other provision of law. The requirements of this article are in addition to the requirements of any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, and where any provision of this article imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, whichever provision is more restrictive or imposes higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall control. 
                  (f)  Severability. If the provisions of any section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this article shall be adjudged invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such judgment shall not affect or invalidate the remainder of any section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this article. 
                  (g)  Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection required by this article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur; flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This article does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This article shall not create liability on the part of the city or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this article or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.

The market value of the building means (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions, which have been identified by the code enforcement official. The term does also not include any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced.

                  (2)  No development shall be allowed within any area of special flood hazard or area of future-conditions flood hazard that could result in any of the following: 
                  a.  Raising the base flood elevation or future-conditions flood elevation equal to or more than 0.01 foot; 
                  b.  Reducing the base flood or future-conditions regulatory flood storage capacity; 
                  c.  Changing the flow characteristics as to the depth and velocity of the waters of the base flood or future-conditions flood as they pass both the upstream and the downstream boundaries of the property; or 
                  d.  Creating hazardous or erosion-producing velocities, or resulting in excessive sedimentation. 
                  (3)  Any development within any area of special flood hazard or area of future-conditions flood hazard allowed under subsection (2) above shall also meet the following conditions: 
                  a.  Compensation for storage capacity shall occur between the average ground water table elevation and the base flood elevation for the base flood, and between the average ground water table elevation and the future-condition flood elevation for the future-conditions flood, and lie within the boundaries of ownership of the property being developed and shall be within the immediate vicinity of the location of the encroachment. Acceptable means of providing required compensation include lowering of natural ground elevations within the floodplain, or lowering of adjoining land areas to create additional floodplain storage. In no case shall any required compensation be provided via bottom storage or by excavating below the elevation of the natural (pre-development) stream channel unless such excavation results from the widening or relocation of the stream channel; 
                  b.  Cut areas shall be stabilized and graded to a slope of no less than 2.0 percent; 
                  c.  Effective transitions shall be provided such that flow velocities occurring on both upstream and downstream properties are not increased or decreased; 
                  d.  Verification of no-rise conditions (0.01 foot or less), flood storage volumes, and flow characteristics shall be provided via a step-backwater analysis meeting the requirements of subsection (d); 
                  e.  Public utilities and facilities, such as water, sanitary sewer, gas, and electrical systems, shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate infiltration or contamination from flood waters; 
                  f.  For residential lots, not less than 70 percent of the buildable land area must lie above the base flood elevation, a minimum of three feet, and/or not less than 50 percent of the minimum lot area must lie above the base flood elevation. 
                  g.  Any significant physical changes to the base flood floodplain shall be submitted as a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) or conditional letter of map amendment (CLOMA), whichever is applicable. The CLOMR submittal shall be subject to approval by the city using the FEMA community concurrence forms before forwarding the submittal package to FEMA for approval. The responsibility for forwarding the CLOMR to FEMA and for obtaining the CLOMR approval shall be the responsibility of the applicant. Within six months of the completion of development, the applicant shall submit as-built surveys and plans for a final letter of map revision (LOMR). A letter of map revision (LOMR) or letter of map amendment (LOMA) must be issued before the final plat can be approved or a certificate of occupancy or completion can be issued. 
                  (d)  Engineering study requirements for floodplain encroachments. An engineering study is required, as appropriate to the proposed development activities on the site, whenever a development proposes to disturb any land within the future-conditions floodplain, except for a residential single-lot development on streams without established base flood elevations and floodways. This study shall be prepared by a licensed professional engineer and made a part of the application for a permit. This information shall be submitted to and approved by the city prior to the approval of any permit which would authorize the disturbance of land located within the future-conditions floodplain. Such study shall include: 
                  (1)  Description of the extent to which any watercourse or floodplain will be altered or relocated as a result of the proposed development; 
                  (2)  Step-backwater analysis, using a method approved by the city. Cross-sections (which may be supplemented by the applicant) and flow information will be obtained whenever available. Computations will be shown duplicating FIS results and will then be rerun with the proposed modifications to determine the new base flood profiles and future-conditions flood profiles; 
                  (3)  Floodplain storage calculations based on cross-sections (at least one every 100 feet) showing existing and proposed floodplain conditions to show that base flood floodplain and future-conditions floodplain storage capacity would not be diminished by the development; 
                  (4)  The study shall include a preliminary plat, grading plan, or site plan, as appropriate, which shall clearly define all future-conditions floodplain encroachments. 
                  (e)  Floodway encroachments. Located within areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity flood waters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, floodways must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore the following provisions shall apply: 
                  (1)  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway, except for activities specifically allowed in (2) below. 
                  (2)  Encrochments for bridges, culverts, roadways and utilities within the regulatory floodway may be permitted provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment will not result in any increase to the pre-project base flood elevations, floodway elevations, or floodway widths during the base flood discharge. A licensed professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof; and 
                  (3)  If the applicant proposes to revise the floodway boundaries, no permit authorizing the encroachment into or an alteration of the floodway shall be issued by the city until an affirmative conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) is issued by FEMA or a no-rise certification is approved by the city. 
                  (f)  Maintenance requirements. The property owner shall be responsible for continuing maintenance as may be needed within an altered or relocated portion of a floodplain on the property so that the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity is maintained. The city may direct the property owner (at no cost to the city) to restore the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity of the floodplain if the owner has not performed maintenance as required by the approved floodplain management plan on file with the city.

                  (a)  Purpose and intent. The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased postdevelopment stormwater runoff and nonpoint source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment. It has been determined that proper management of postdevelopment stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety, environment and general welfare of the public and protect water and aquatic resources. This article seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives: 
                  (1)  Establish decision-making processes surrounding land development activities that protect the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources; 
                  (2)  Require that new development and redevelopment maintain the predevelopment hydrologic response in their postdevelopment state as nearly as practicable in order to reduce flooding, streambank erosion, nonpoint source pollution and increases in stream temperature, and maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats; 
                  (3)  Establish minimum postdevelopment stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality; 
                  (4)  Establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater control facilities that can be used to meet the minimum postdevelopment stormwater management standards; 
                  (5)  Encourage the use of nonstructural stormwater management and stormwater better site design practices, such as the preservation of greenspace and other conservation areas, to the maximum extent practicable. Coordinate site design plans, which include greenspace, with the county's greenspace protection plan; 
                  (6)  Establish provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of structural stormwater control facilities and nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained, and pose no threat to public safety; and 
                  (7)  Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans, and for the inspection of approved active projects, and longterm followup. 
                  (b)  Applicability. 
                  (1)  This article shall be applicable to all land development, including, but not limited to, site plan applications, subdivision applications and grading applications, unless exempt pursuant to subsection (2) of this section. These standards apply to any new development or redevelopment site that meets one or more of the following criteria, or as otherwise required by the director: 
                  a.  New development that involves the creation of 5,000 square feet or more of impervious cover, or that involves other land development activities of 5,000 square feet or more; 
                  b.  Redevelopment that includes the creation, addition or replacement of 5,000 square feet or more of impervious cover, or that involves other land development activity of 5,000 square feet or more; 
                  c.  Any new development or redevelopment, regardless of size, that is defined by the director to be a hotspot land use; or 
                  d.  Land development activities that are smaller than the minimum applicability criteria set forth in subsections (b)(1)a and b of this section if such activities are part of a larger common plan of development, even though multiple, separate and distinct land development activities may take place at different times on different schedules. 
                  (2)  The following activities are exempt from this article: 
                  a.  Agricultural or silvicultural land management activities within areas zoned for these activities; and 
                  b.  Repairs to any stormwater management facility or practice deemed necessary by the director. 
                  (c)  Designation of article administrator. The director or a designee is hereby appointed to administer and implement the provisions of this article. 
                  (d)  Compatibility with other regulations. This article is not intended to modify or repeal any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law. The requirements of this article are in addition to the requirements of any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, and where any provision of this article imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, whichever provision is more restrictive or imposes higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall control. 
                  (e)  Severability. If the provisions of any section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this article shall be adjudged invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such judgment shall not affect or invalidate the remainder of any section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this article.

In addition, if hydrologic or topographic conditions, or land use activities warrant greater control than that provided by the minimum control requirements, the city may impose additional requirements deemed necessary to protect upstream and downstream properties and aquatic resources from damage due to increased volume, frequency and rate of stormwater runoff or increased nonpoint source pollution loads created on the site in question. 
                  b.  Applicants shall consult the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual for guidance on the factors that determine site design feasibility when selecting and locating a structural stormwater control. 
                  (6)  Stormwater credits for nonstructural measures. The use of one or more site design measures by the applicant may allow for a reduction in the water quality treatment volume required under subsection (1) of this section. The applicant may, if approved by the city community development department, take credit for the use of stormwater better site design practices and reduce the water quality volume requirement. For each potential credit, there is a minimum set of criteria and requirements which identify the conditions or circumstances under which the credit may be applied. The site design practices that qualify for this credit and the criteria and procedures for applying and calculating the credits are included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. 
                  (7)  Drainage system guidelines. Stormwater conveyance facilities, which may include but are not limited to culverts, stormwater drainage pipes, catch basins, drop inlets, junction boxes, headwalls, gutter, swales, channels, ditches and energy dissipaters, shall be provided when necessary for the protection of public right-of-way and private properties adjoining project sites and/or public right-of-ways.

                  Sec. 109-119. - Compatibility with other buffer regulations and requirements. 
                  (a)  This article is not intended to interfere with, abrogate or annul any other ordinance, rule or regulation, statute or other provision of law. The requirements of this article should be considered minimum requirements, and where any provision of this article imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall be considered to take precedence. Additional standards which apply and will be enforced by Johns Creek are: 
                  (1)  Metropolitan River Protection Act and Chattahoochee Corridor Plan: Requires a 50-foot undisturbed vegetative buffer and 150-foot impervious surface setback on the Chattahoochee and its impoundments and a 35-foot undisturbed vegetative buffer (all measured from the edge of the water) on perennial tributary streams in a Corridor extending 2,000 feet from either bank of the river and its impoundments. The corridor extends from Buford Dam to the downstream limits of the Atlanta region (Douglas and Fulton Counties). Streams in the basin of the corridor are required to be protected by buffers, but no required width is specified. (O.C.G.A. § 12-5-440 et seq.) 
                  (2)  DNR Part 5 Criteria for Small (under 100 square miles) Water Supply Watersheds Authorized under Part V of the Georgia Planning Act of 1989, these criteria require 100-foot undisturbed buffers and 150-foot setbacks on all perennial streams within seven miles upstream of a public water supply reservoir or public water supply intake. Beyond seven miles, the required buffer is 50 feet and the required setback is 75 feet. Equivalent protection measures can be adopted with approval from Georgia DCA and DNR. 
                  (3)  DNR Part 5 Criteria for River Protection Authorized under the 1991 Mountains and River Corridors Protection Act of 1991, these criteria require a 100-foot buffer along rivers with average annual flows of greater than 400 cfs (excepting the portion of the Chattahoochee referenced above). The buffer is measured from the top of the stream bank. 
                  (4)  Other such state and federal regulations as may be adopted from time to time. 
                  (b)  While the requirements of this article are intended to apply to all streams in the City of Johns Creek, special conditions may exist that require greater protection. Nothing in this article should be construed as preventing the establishment of wider and/or more restrictive buffers and setbacks as required under any other existing or future legislation. In addition, nothing in this article should be construed as preventing the establishment of wider buffers for purposes of protecting greenspace, preserving habitat or other goals that may not be specifically mandated by legislation.

                  Sec. 109-151. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices. 
                  (a)  General provisions . Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities. Therefore, plans for those land disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of this section. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion and sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit. 
                  (b)  Minimum requirements/BMPs . 
                  (1)  Best management practices as set forth in subsections (b) and (c) of this section shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation and maintenance of BMPs shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the EPD director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with subsection (2) of this section or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f) of the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act." As used in this subsection, the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
                  (2)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where BMPs have not been properly designed, installed and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land disturbing permit issued by Johns Creek or of any state general permit issued by the division, pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 Nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten Nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines issued by the EPD director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install or maintain BMPs shall constitute noncompliance with any land disturbing permit issued by Johns Creek or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such failure occurs. When such noncompliance is identified by the director of community development, official notice will be posted on that property. 
                  (4)  The director EPD may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur as outlined by the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System requirements. 
                  (5)  The local issuing authority may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in (c)(16) and (17), in light of O.C.G.A. § 12.7.6(c). 
                  (c)  Rules and regulations governing land disturbing activities . The rules and regulations, ordinances or resolutions adopted pursuant to this article and O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and/or minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia," published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Proper erosion and sediment control measures must be installed along site boundaries prior to stripping of vegetation, regrading, and other development activities as deemed by the director of community development to minimize erosion and prevent sediment from leaving the site. 
                  (2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum. 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to minimum erosion potential. 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented. 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum. 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable. 
                  (7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect all exposed areas (especially steep cuts and/or banks, etc.) during development. 
                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control measures shall be installed as soon as practicable. 
                  (9)  Sediment in runoff water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, sediment barriers, construction exits or similar BMPs as outlined in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this subsection, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of this section, and O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping surface of fills. 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)  Migrated soil materials or soil materials displaced by mechanical means from land disturbing sites to adjacent water courses, such as lakes, ponds, streams and creeks, etc., must be remediated. The remedial work shall be conducted as per a remedial plan approved by Johns Creek. 
                  (14)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of temporary or permanent bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, those such crossings are kept to a minimum. 
                  (15)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection (b)(2) of this section. 
                  (16)  Except as provided in subsection (c)(17) and (c)(18) of this section, there is an established 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the EPD director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment where otherwise allowed by the EPD director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, or where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated is the project plans and specifications are implemented; or where bulkheads and sea walls are installed to prevent shoreline erosion on Lake Oconee and Lake Sinclair; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term 'ephemeral stream' means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow, Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to article 5, chapter 5 of title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the EPD director as provided in this subsection. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbance activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed, except as otherwise provided by this subsection. 
                  b.  Temporary structural best management practices are required to be removed at the completion of project. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer way be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim underbrush in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed. 
                  c.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
                  1.  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
                  2.  Stream crossings for sewer lines. 
                  (17)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to article 2 of chapter 5 of title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and steams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. For single-family residence construction covered by the provisions section 109-150(4), there shall be a buffer zone between the residence and any state waters classified as trout streams pursuant to article 2 of chapter 5 of the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act." In any such buffer zone, no land-disturbing activity shall be conducted between the residence and the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action from the banks of the trout waters. For primary trout waters, the buffer zone shall be at least 50 horizontal feet, and no variance to a smaller buffer shall be granted. For secondary trout waters, the buffer zone shall be at least 50 horizontal feet, but the EPD director may grant variances to no less than 25 feet. Regardless of whether a trout stream is primary or secondary, for first order trout waters, which are streams into which no other streams flow except for springs, the buffer shall be at least 25 horizontal feet, and no variance to a smaller buffer shall be granted. The minimum requirements of this section and the buffer zones provided by this section shall be enforced by the director of community development. The EPD director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbance activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetation cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and natural canopy is left in sufficient quality to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
                  1.  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
                  2.  Stream crossings for sewer lines. 
                  (18)  There is established a 25 foot buffer along coastal marshlands, as measured horizontally from the coastal marshland-upland interface, as determined in accordance with Chapter 5 of Title 12 of this title, the "Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1970." And the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where an alteration within the buffer area has been authorized pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-286, for maintenance of any currently serviceable structure, landscaping, or hardscaping, including bridges, roads, parking lots, golf courses, golf cart paths, retaining walls, bulkheads, and patios; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, where a drainage structure or roadway drainage structure is constructed or maintained; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, on the landward side of any currently serviceable shoreline stabilization structure, or for the maintenance of any manmade storm-water detention basin, golf course pond, or impoundment that is located entirely within the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. For the purposes of this paragraph maintenance shall be defined as actions necessary or appropriate for retaining or restoring a currently serviceable improvement to the specified operable condition to achieve its maximum useful life. Maintenance includes emergency reconstruction of recently damaged parts of a currently serviceable structure so long as it occurs within a reasonable period of time after damage occurs. Maintenance does not include any modification that changes the character, scope or size of the original design and serviceable shall be defined as usable in its current state or with minor maintenance but not so degraded as to essentially require reconstruction. 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to crossings for utility lines that cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer, provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
                  c.  The buffer shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity conducted pursuant to and in compliance with a valid and effective land-disturbing permit issued subsequent to April 22, 2014, and prior to December 31, 2015; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented or any lot for which the preliminary plat has been approved prior to December 31, 2015 if roadways, bridges, or water and sewer lines have been extended to such lot prior to the effective date of this Act and if the requirement to maintain a 25 foot buffer would consume at least 18 percent of the high ground of the platted lot otherwise available for development; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
                  d.  Activities where the area within the buffer is not more than 500 square feet or that have a "minor buffer impact" as defined in 391-3-7-.01(r), provided that the total area of buffer impacts is less than 5,000 square feet are deemed to have an approved buffer variance by rule. Bank stabilization structures are not eligible for coverage under the variance by rule and notification shall be made to the division at least 14 days prior to the commencement of land disturbing activities. 
                  (d)  Adoption of additional requirements . Nothing contained in this article and O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et. seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. 
                  (e)  Injury to property not evidence of standards violation . The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided in this article or terms of the permit. 
                  (f)  Additional requirements . Where the director of community development finds, through inspection, that property owners have been adversely affected due to violations clearly identified by the director of community development, or that the approved current plans do not adequately address the features of the site, the director of community development can require additional BMPs, drawings and revisions to comply with the minimum requirements as outlined in this section.

They shall review the zoning ordinance, post-development stormwater management ordinance, development regulations, floodplain management/flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and other ordinances which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the city. However, the operator is the only party who may obtain a permit. 
                  (b)  Application requirements . 
                  (1)  Prior to any land-disturbing activity, the property in question must be part of an approved and recorded legal lot of record (exemption plat, minor plat, or final plat). Additionally, no land-disturbing activity, including grading, excavating, filling and/or foundation work, shall be conducted within the city, until a land-disturbance permit or a building permit (for those projects not requiring a land-disturbance permit under this article) shall have been issued by the director of community development allowing such activity, pursuant to the provisions herein provided. If a project is to be developed in phases, then a separate land disturbance permit or building permit is required for each phase not to exceed 25-acre increments and the development sequence should be followed on all projects issued a land disturbance permit. 
                  (2)  No person shall conduct any land disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of Johns Creek without first obtaining a permit from the city department of community development or its successor to perform such activity. 
                  (3)  All developments, construction, improvements, utilities and demolitions that occur within the boundaries of the incorporated limits of the city that disturb more than 5,000 square feet of land shall be required to submit an application for a land-disturbance permit. 
                  (4)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the department of community development and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection (c) of this section. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed conforms to the provisions of subsections 109-151(b) and (c). Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by seven copies of the applicant's soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans and a physical address of the property owner (post office box not acceptable). All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
                  (5)  A minimum fee, as set by the Johns Creek City Council, shall be charged for each acre, or fraction thereof, of the project area. 
                  (6)  In addition to the city's permitting fees, fees also will be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(5)(a), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. Half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  (7)  The permit applicant shall be required to post a bond (surety) in the form of insurance bond, cash, or irrevocable letter of credit prior to issuing the permit. The bond amount shall be determined as established by the city department of community development, but not exceeding $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity. If the applicant does not comply with this article or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the city may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These corrective actions may include, but are not limited to, desilting detention ponds, water bodies, stormwater facilities, roadways, installing a fence with locking device, reestablishing damaged buffers and similar or related actions. 
                  (8)  If a permit applicant has had two or more outstanding violations of previous permits, this article, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975 (O.C.G.A. § 12.7-1 et seq.), as amended within three years prior to the date of filing of the application under consideration, the city may deny the permit application. 
                  (9)  If applicable, immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the city shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the city. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by subsections 109-151(c)(16) and (c)(17) and bonding, if required as per subsection (b)(7) of this section, have been obtained. Such review will not be required if Johns Creek and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the city to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
                  (c)  Plan requirements . 
                  (1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in section 109-151(b) and (c) of this article, or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this ordinance. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and storm water management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
                  (2)  Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
                  (d)  Permits and development activity . 
                  (1)  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by the city of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
                  (2)  No permit shall be issued by the city unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and unless Johns Creek has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this article, any variances required by section 109-151(c)(16) or (c)(17) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per subsection (b)(7) of this section are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of unincorporated Johns Creek are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
                  (3)  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase to include the development sequence. 
                  (4)  The permit may be suspended, revoked or modified by the city, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in title is not in compliance with the approved erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this article. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him of the conditions contained in the permit as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan. 
                  (5)  Sedimentation basins shall not be allowed in a live stream. 
                  (6)  The permittee shall ensure that engineering and construction on any land within the city shall be carried out in such a manner as to protect neighboring persons and property from damage or loss resulting from stormwater runoff, soil erosion or deposition upon private property or public streets or water-transported silt or debris. 
                  (7)  If, through inspection, the director of community development determines that full implementation of the approved plan does not provide for effective erosion, sedimentation and pollution control, additional erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures shall be implemented to control or treat the sediment source. 
                  (8)  It shall constitute non-compliance with this article to engage in land-disturbance activity involving clearing, grading, or grubbing without a permit, which activity may immediately warrant citation. 
                  (9)  Design and installation of properly functioning detention facilities, including outflow and overflow control devices, shall be the responsibility of the owner. If any erosion control devices are damaged or destroyed during grading or construction; all construction processes shall cease until the devices are restored to their functioning capability. The owner, through application for grading or construction permits, accepts the responsibility of maintenance of the control devices. 
                  (10)  The developer shall provide stabilization by covering the soil with permanent seeding, sprigging or pivoting producing long-term vegetative cover; temporary seeding producing short-term vegetative cover; sodding or covering areas with a turf of perennial sod-forming grass; and security fences for safety purposes at detention facilities as prescribed by and prior to approval by the city. 
                  (11)  Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this ordinance, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority.

                  (1)  Building permit . No land-disturbing activity or other work (including moving and demolition) shall commence on a project until the owner or the contractor undertaking the work shall have applied for, and been issued, a land-disturbance permit or building permit by the director of community development. The owner/contractor shall prominently display on site the building permit, a signed erosion and sedimentation control agreement and approved site plan in full public view, until issuance of certification of occupancy. Demolition projects shall be required to install BMPs where necessary to prevent erosion. Failure to install BMPs shall constitute noncompliance with this article. 
                  (2)  Notice of violation . The director of community development shall issue a notice of violation for failure to either install or maintain best management practices (BMPs), even though sediments remain contained within the boundaries of the property by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, sediment barriers and construction exits in accordance with this article. Subsequently, a stop work order shall be issued if compliance with a notice of violation is not achieved by the end of the specified compliance period of five days. 
                  (3)  Stop work order . The director of community development or representative shall issue an order to cease all work ("stop work order") on a project covered by this section if any work on that project is proceeding without a land disturbance permit or building permit, or, when silt, mud or other waterborne debris leave the property boundary, or (if such a permit has been issued) it is found by the director of community development or representative that all or any portion of the project remains out of compliance with any requirements of subsections 109-151(b) or (c), any other provision of this article or any other the city ordinance, regulation or requirement after the specified compliance period or a site has been in violation at least two prior occurrences, to include any applicable fines and penalties. All other requirements of subsection 109-157(b) also apply to projects covered by this section.

                  Sec. 109-155. - Inspection and enforcement of article. 
                  (a)  The director of community development will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the approved plan, permit and this article and to determine if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling soil erosion and sedimentation. Also, the city shall regulate both primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, an official notice shall be posted on site, and as a courtesy a written notice of violation shall also be served upon that person, except for working without a permit or working under a stop work order, which warrant immediate citation. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply with the corrective measures specified in the posted official notice within the time specified, he or she shall be found in violation of this article, and the director of community development may take such additional enforcement actions as he/she deems appropriate. 
                  (b)  The director of community development shall have the power to conduct such investigation as the director of community development may deem reasonably necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this article, and for this purpose shall have the power to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purposes of investigation and inspection of the sites of land disturbance or building activities. 
                  (c)  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the city, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper, or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties including, but not limited to, the review of reports, studies, calculations, drawings, revisions, practices, actions and bonds. 
                  (d)  A copy of a current approved plan shall be kept on site until project completion or issuance of certificate of occupancy. 
                  (e)  The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). The districts or the commission, or both, may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the counties or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
                  (f)  The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within 90 days after notification by the division, the division may revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority.

                  (a)  Failure to obtain a permit for land-disturbing activity . If any person commences any land-disturbing activity requiring a land-disturbing permit, as prescribed in this article, without first obtaining said permit, the person shall be subject to revocation of his business license, work permit or other authorization to conduct any business and associated work activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the city. Failure to comply may result in a citation being issued to appear in municipal court which may result in monetary fines. 
                  (b)  Stop work orders and notice of violations . 
                  (1)  For the first and second violations of the provisions of this article, the director of community development or the director EPD shall post an official notice of violation on site and as a courtesy issue a written letter. The violator shall have five days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within five days, the Director of community development or the director EPD shall issue a stop work order requiring the land-disturbance activity be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided, however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land-disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the director of community development or the director EPD shall issue an immediate stop work order in lieu of notice of violation. For the third and each subsequent violation, the director of community development or the director EPD shall issue an immediate stop work order. 
                  (2)  All stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. 
                  (3)  It shall be unlawful for any representative of the owner to remove an official notice of violation or stop work posting. If this action is observed by a city representative, the owner will be responsible for any and all possible fines. Upon issuance of a stop work order, the director of community development or representative shall post official notice at such locations on the project site as deemed appropriate. Such posted official notice shall be prominently displayed on the owner's property until the stop work order is rescinded by the director of community development, at which time said posted notice will be removed by the director of community development or representative. When a violation in the form of taking action without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer or significant amounts of sediment, as determined by director of community development or his designee, have been or are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed and maintained, a stop work order shall be issued by the director of community development or the director EPD or his designee. All such stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop work orders shall apply to all land-disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls. 
                  (c)  Reinspection fee . The director of community development shall assess a minimum $50.00 reinspection fee to a project if a reinspection is requested prior to the end of a compliance period and the site is found to remain out of compliance upon that inspection. Such fees (to cover administrative, field inspections and transportation costs) must be satisfied prior to the issuance of a final erosion inspection or a certificate of occupancy. 
                  (d)  Bond forfeiture . If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities has failed to comply with the approved plan and permit, an official notice of violation shall be posted on site and a letter will be issued as a courtesy. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to have forfeited his performance bond, if required to post one under the provisions of subsection 109-152(b)(7). The City may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site and bring it into compliance. 
                  (e)  Noncompliance . Noncompliance with this article shall be dealt with as follows: Any person found to be in noncompliance with any provision of this article shall be served official notice by the department of community development. The offender shall, within the period of time stated in the notice, take all necessary action to gain compliance and shall permanently cease such noncompliance. 
                  (f)  Monetary penalties . Any person who violates any provisions of this article, or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant to this article or who negligently fails or refuses to comply with any final or emergency order of the director EPD issued as provided in this article shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 per day.

                  (1)  Feeder roots means a complex system of small annual roots growing outward and predominantly upward from the system of "transport roots." These roots branch four or more times to form fans or mats of thousands of fine, short, non-woody tips. Many of these small roots and their multiple tips are 0.2 to one mm or less in diameter and less than one to two mm long. These roots constitute the major fraction of a tree's root system surface area and are the primary sites of absorption of water and nutrients. 
                  (2)  Major woody roots means first order tree roots originating at the "root collar" and growing horizontally in the soil to a distance of between three and 15 feet from the tree's trunk. These roots branch and decrease in diameter to give rise to "rope roots."

                  (2)  Heritage tree means a tree which is designated upon approval by the director of the community development department or his designee to be of notable historical value or interest because of its age, size or historical association. 
                  (3)  Specimen tree means any tree which has been determined by the city arborist to be of high value because of its type, size, age or other professional criteria, and has been so designated according to administrative standards established by the community development department. 
                  (4)  Stand of specimen trees means a contiguous grouping of trees which has been determined to be of value by the director of the community development department or authorized designee. 
                  a.  A relatively mature even-aged stand.

                  Tree save area means all areas designated for the purpose of meeting tree density requirements, saving specimen trees and/or preserving natural buffers. 
                  Tributary means any perennial stream (or portion thereof) within the affected area that is portrayed as a solid blue line on the United States Geological Survey 7.5 Quadrangle Maps, 1968 edition, or other perennial streams as identified by the City of Johns Creek. 
                  Wetlands means those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bog and similar areas. 
                  Zoning regulations means the zoning ordinance of the City of Johns Creek, as amended, or such regulations subsequently adopted by the city council inclusive of conditions of zoning, use permit or variance approval established pursuant thereto.

Prior to remediation a plan shall be submitted to and approved by the city arborist.

                  (a)  The director of the community development department will evaluate all development projects (excluding timber harvesting) requesting property clearcutting. If upon completion of the site evaluation, the community development department deems it appropriate to allow property clearcutting activities, a bond will be required. The bond will be required by the City of Johns Creek as a mechanism to cover any potential cost associated with revegetation of the clearcut property in the event of property abandonment. 
                  (b)  The required bond amount will be 125 percent of the total cost for replanting trees to satisfy the density standards for the project site. A tree replacement cost obtained from a plant nursery will be provided to director of the community development department with the clearcut request and the bond amount will be based on the tree replacement cost. The director of the community development department reserves the right to request additional replacement cost if deemed appropriate. The director of the community development department will hold the bond until the project activity, including tree replacement to satisfy the site density requirements, is completed. If upon issuing the land disturbance permit, the property is clearcut and there are no construction or development activities conducted within six months. The director of the community development department will attempt to contact the property owner (via certified mail) for a project update. Should the property owner not respond within 30 days of receipt of the status request, the bond will be used to revegetate the project site.

                  (b)  Any person aggrieved or affected by any decision of the director of the department of community development relating to the application of these regulations may file an appeal within 30 days of the decision with the board of zoning appeals . The appeal shall be made through the director of community development. 
                  (c)  Appeals shall only be granted for errors of interpretation or where the unique natural features of the site are such that application of these regulations would create an undue hardship to the property owner, and in other instances where an undue hardship is created for the owner of the property.

                  (1)  Enforcement procedures. The following are the enforcement procedures authorized by this chapter: 
                  a.  Notices of violation enforcement. 
                  1.  Enforcement actions may begin with the issuance of a written notice of violation to the owner or responsible person by the director. The notice may be delivered personally, sent by first class mail, or posted onsite. The notice of violation shall contain at least the following information: 
                  i.  The name and address of the owner or responsible person;

Plan and profile sheets, if any, shall have a horizontal scale of no less than 100 feet to one inch and a vertical scale of no less than ten feet to one inch. 
                  (3)  Project boundary data. 
                  a.  The site plan shall be based on the boundaries of a lot as recorded on a final subdivision plat or on a certified boundary survey delineating the entirety of the property contained within the project, and tied to a point of reference (tie point) with the same degree of accuracy as the boundary survey itself. The survey shall have an accuracy of no less than one in 10,000, and shall meet all requirements of Georgia Law regarding the recording of maps and plats. 
                  b.  Each site plan shall be drawn on, accompanied by, or referenced to a boundary survey which shall at least meet the requirements of subsection [(3)a.] above. 
                  (4)  Site development plan checklist. The development plans shall contain sufficient data to determine sufficient regulatory compliance with all city codes and ordinances. The submittal shall be in compliance with the minimum information required under subsections 113-111(4)—(7) of these regulations. The site development plans shall conform to checklists maintained by the department of community development.

                  Sec. 113-115. - Tree preservation/replacement/landscape plan specifications. 
                  (1)  Plan required. A tree preservation/replacement/landscape plan shall be required as described in the tree preservation ordinance. 
                  (2)  Plan preparation. Tree preservation/replacement/landscape plans shall be prepared in accordance with the specifications contained in the tree preservation ordinance. At the developer's option, the plan may be combined with other plans such as a general landscaping plan for the project.

                  ARTICLE XI. - STREET DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS 

                  Sec. 113-121. - General. 
                  (1)  General requirements. 
                  a.  The sections enumerated in this article are guidelines, and are intended to be benchmark indicators of what standards could be acceptable. They are further intended to allow alternate designs which could produce results similar to these performance standards and similar protection to the public. The objective of these performance standards is not to suggest a single methodological standard of acceptance exclusive of all others. Rather they establish what would otherwise be allowed in the absence of an acceptable alternative. 
                  b.  All new streets proposed to be constructed in a subdivision or other development, whether to be public or private, shall be designed and constructed to the standards contained in these regulations and in accordance with the classification of said street. 
                  c.  Streets, whether existing or new, shall be constructed or improved under those circumstances and to the standards as established in these regulations. Roadway improvements shall be in accordance with the street classifications as shown in the comprehensive plan, as may be amended, or the zoning ordinance, as applicable, or as otherwise required by the public works director. 
                  (2)  Compliance with comprehensive plan or overlay districts. In cases where the city has developed alternate design criteria in the comprehensive plan or for specific areas covered under an overlay district, those design requirements shall be used in lieu of those provided herein.

                  Sec. 113-122. - Specifications. 
                  Unless otherwise specifically set forth herein, all of the materials, methods of construction, and workmanship for the work covered in reference to street construction shall conform to the latest specifications of GDOT. 
                  (Ord. No. 2009-06-18, (11.2), 6-29-2009) 
                  Sec. 113-123. - Access. 
                  (1)  Arrangement of lots. When land is subdivided into larger parcels than ordinary building lots, such parcels shall be arranged and designed so as to allow for the opening of future streets and to provide access to those areas not presently served by streets. 
                  (2)  Access to adjacent properties—Inter-parcel access. 
                  a.  No subdivision or development shall be designed so as to completely eliminate street access to adjoining parcels of land. Every development shall be designed to facilitate access to adjoining properties which are developed or anticipated to be developed. Locations of inter-parcel access shall be as required by and subject to the approval of the department. 
                  b.  Inter-parcel access easements shall be recorded in the office of the clerk of the county superior court and reference to deed book and copy of such recorded easement provided to the director. 
                  c.  The inter-parcel access easement shall permit automobile access from the adjoining property to driveways and parking areas intended for customer or tenant use; but parking spaces may be restricted to use by the owner's customers and tenants only. 
                  d.  The pavement or other surfacing of the owner's driveways and parking areas shall be extended to the point of access on the property line. 
                  (3)  Vehicular access to lots. Any lot required to provide minimum frontage by the zoning district in which the lot is located shall provide vehicular access directly from a public or private street along the frontage or along any other property line which abuts a street, except as provided in subsection (5) of this section. 
                  (4)  Private streets. Private streets shall be constructed to the roadway construction standards of the city, as contained herein. The private roads shall be maintained by a mandatory homeowners association and documents of incorporation shall be submitted to the director of community development for review and approval prior to the recording of the final plat. The private streets shall be clearly designated as such on the final plat. 
                  (5)  Vehicular access easements. Vehicular access may be provided from a public street indirectly via easement in any one or more of the following circumstances: 
                  a.  The property is not required to provide a minimum frontage by the applicable zoning district, provided that the easement shall be in a location and the access driveway shall have a width and alignment acceptable to the fire department and the department. 
                  b.  The property is a buildable lot of record, as defined herein, but does not meet the minimum frontage requirement of the applicable zoning district. The property must be served by an exclusive access easement which shall be limited to the provision of access to only one principal use or structure. 
                  c.  The access easement serves a single-family residence on a lot which is otherwise a buildable lot of record, and which is sharing a common driveway with no more than two other single-family residences. 
                  d.  The access easement was lawfully established as such under the code, ordinances, or regulations of the city prior to the adoption of these development regulations. 
                  e.  The access easement coincides with a private roadway approved under the code, ordinances, or regulations of the city. All new private roadways must be constructed to the roadway standards of these development regulations, and their ownership and maintenance responsibility by private party(s). The access easement width shall be the same as required for right-of-way on a similarly classified public road, i.e. the easement on a local street within a residential subdivision shall be the same width as the right-of-way for a public, local residential street. 
                  f.  The access easement serves a buildable lot of record which meets the minimum frontage requirements of the zoning ordinance, but at which point the access is not achieved. 
                  (6)  Maximum number of lots with a single entrance. A maximum number of 200 residential dwelling units may be allowed to be constructed with only one street outlet to an existing public street. If a second access to an existing public road is not available or, in the opinion of the public works director, could induce non-residential traffic through the development, a single entrance may be allowed if designed with a traffic signal and/or sufficient right-of-way and improvements to provide a protected left-turn lane, subject to the approval of the department of public works. Where more than 200 residential dwelling units are provided and a second access is not required by the director of public works the fire marshal shall review the site to determine if a private access meeting the requirements of a fire apparatus road may be required. 
                  (7)  Gated access. Gated access to projects must be developed in accordance with the following minimum requirements: 
                  a.  Gates shall not be located within the public right-of-way and must be set back a minimum distance of 20 feet from the right-of-way. As defined for this section the location of the right-of-way shall be the location of the existing right-of-way or dedicated right-of-way whichever is greater. Additional set back may be required to provide for adequate stacking distance, turnaround and emergency vehicle access as required by the city. 
                  b.  Minimum gate width must equal the required road width plus the width of any utility easements present. Where gates are provided with a center support post a minimum clear width of 20 feet shall be provided on either side unless otherwise approved by the fire marshal. 
                  c.  Gate width and placement must be reviewed by, and are subject to approval by the fire marshal's office and the department of public works. 
                  d.  Arrangements for access through the gate for emergency service vehicles must be reviewed by, and are subject to approval by the fire marshal's office. Emergency service vehicles include, but are not limited to, fire suppression equipment, medical emergency vehicles, and law enforcement vehicles. Necessary arrangements may include Knox-fire boxes for keyed/keyless entry, keypad code entry, occupant telephone authorized entry, and/or automatic gate opening upon power disconnect. 
                  e.  Arrangements for access through the gate for non-emergency service vehicles must be reviewed by, and are subject to approval by, the department of public works. Non-emergency public service vehicles include, but are not limited to, mail delivery, garbage pickup, public utility meter reading, and public utility maintenance and inspection vehicles. Necessary arrangements may include, but are not limited to: access easements for refuse collection vehicles and appropriate utility easements for public utility development and maintenance. 
                  f.  Gates may not restrict access to any public right-of-way or publicly owned property within the proposed development. 
                  g.  The city must be properly indemnified against any liability resulting from the proposed development including damage from or broken utilities, fines associated with damaged or broken utilities. This indemnification shall be evidenced by: 
                  1.  The release and indemnity statement placed on the plat. 
                  2.  The developer shall grant such easements to the appropriate governing authority or utility company as is necessary for public purposes regarding said community. 
                  h.  The following standards shall be used by the city when considering any request for gated communities: 
                  1.  The developer must demonstrate adequate provision for perpetual maintenance of the private road and any other infrastructure associated with the development, including but not limited to a note on the plat, language in the covenants, and a clause in each deed of conveyance by the developer for each lot in the subdivision acknowledging the perpetual maintenance of the private road (and other private infrastructure) by the homeowners' association. 
                  2.  The developer must demonstrate an adequate strategy for necessary emergency access. 
                  3.  The private road and gate must not unreasonably impede the logical future development of public roads in the vicinity of the project. 
                  4.  The private road and gate must not unreasonably restrict public access to sites of cultural, historical, or natural significance. 
                  5.  The private road and gate must not unreasonably restrict previously established pedestrian access. 
                  6.  Gates may be denied based on traffic conditions, interconnectivity needs and when not in compliance with adopted guidelines. 
                  (8)  Access improvements. When property that abuts upon an existing or proposed city street is to be developed or redeveloped and the city street will provide access to the property, access improvements to the city road (deceleration lanes, turn lanes, etc.) shall be provided by the developer as required in section 113-124. 
                  (9)  Fire apparatus access road. A fire apparatus access road may be required to be provided for every facility, building, or portion of building hereafter constructed or moved into the city as approved by the fire marshal. 
                  (10)  Documentation required for alternative designs. In the event that an alternative is suggested by the applicant, studies and reports conducted by professionals currently certified in the State of Georgia will be required to be submitted to and approved by the department. These studies and reports must clearly relate to the desired results and purposes expressed or implied in the applicable performance standard. Once an alternative has been approved by the department, it shall become a required standard applicable to the specific approved permit only.

                  Sec. 113-124. - Driveways intersections and access improvements. 
                  (1)  Angle and improvements. Driveways shall generally be at right angles and shall not be at an angle of less than 85 degrees for roadways classified as arterials or collectors and 80 degrees for all other roadway classifications unless approved by the department. This requirement may be waived by the public works director where the driveway access is to a sub-standard road (i.e. dirt or gravel) or a rural road section. 
                  (2)  Driveway design standards. 
                  a.  Driveways provide access to property and are a service to the traveling public. However, vehicles entering or leaving driveways may disrupt the flow of traffic on streets and cause accidents, thereby infringing on the rights of the public to travel the roadway. All driveways should be restricted to locations where movements into and out of them can occur in a safe and orderly manner. 
                  b.  Driveways should always be designed to eliminate or minimize opposite lane encroachment while entering and exiting property. 
                  c.  All driveways are to be designed and constructed with sidewalk/multi-use trail transitions as appropriate. Cross slope shall not exceed two percent in areas where sidewalk/multi-use trail is present or is planned to be installed according to the future sidewalk and trail network map, comprehensive plan or project approved by city council. 
                  d.  All driveways are to be considered low volume intersections and shall comply with the minimum intersection/corner sight distance requirements of these regulations. 
                  e.  All driveways shall slope up from the edge of road a minimum of six inches within the right-of-way to ensure that stormwater surface flow is maintained within the right-of-way. This requirement may be waived by the public works director in road sections that drain away from the gutter line, i.e. the high side of super-elevated curves. 
                  f.  No catch basins will be allowed within access/driveway radii (turning radii). 
                  g.  Where a driveway is constructed at a location that has or should have a ditch along the roadside for the purpose of collecting, channeling, and controlling stormwater runoff the driveway shall be constructed with a culvert designed to conduct stormwater beneath the driveway in accordance with the following: 
                  1.  Concrete, corrugated metal pipe, or other type of culvert approved by department of public works; 
                  2.  Sized to accommodate the 25-year storm, as a minimum, with a minimum pipe size of 18 inches. Larger storm events may need to be accommodated as specified in article XIII; 
                  3.  Provided with flared-end sections or headwalls at the inlet and outlet; and, 
                  4.  Of sufficient length to accommodate a minimum of two-foot shoulders on each side of the driveway with a maximum side slope of 2:1 to the bottom of the ditch line; and 
                  5.  Installed in a ditch with a minimum two-foot wide flat bottom with sides sloped at a grade no greater than 2:1 and stabilized with acceptable vegetation. 
                  h.  When the construction of any driveway requires the installation of a pavement overlay the overlay shall comply with subsection 113-129(3)c. of these regulations. 
                  (3)  Residential driveway standards. 
                  a.  Residential driveways provide a primary means of access to single-family, detached residential uses and shall conform to the following standards: 
                  1.  Width. Minimum 14 feet, maximum 18 feet within the right-of-way. 
                  2.  Radii or flare. Minimum five feet. 
                  3.  The curb cut shall not encroach on the radius of the curb at a street corner. 
                  4.  Spacing from street intersection (measured from ROW of intersecting street to nearest edge of driveway). Minimum 50 feet. 
                  5.  No curb cut shall be less than five feet from the side property line, as measured along the right-of-way or as approved by the director. 
                  6.  Length. A minimum of 25 feet or to the edge of the city or state right-of-way, whichever is greater, shall be paved with a treated hardened surface. Rural residential driveways may be constructed with an asphalt pavement section, if approved by the department of public works. 
                  7.  Not more than two curb cuts shall be permitted on any one street frontage classified as a local street. When two cuts are permitted there shall be a safety zone of not less than ten feet, as measured along the curbline, between the inside edges of the driveways. 
                  8.  Not more than one private curb cut may be located on any one street frontage for any one dwelling where the street is classified as a collector or higher order street. If a lot has access to more than one frontage, it may not have any private curb cuts on a street that is classified as a collector or higher order street. If both frontages are classified as collector or higher order streets, then the curb cut may be on the frontage with the lowest classification, or as designated by the public works department. 
                  (4)  Nonresidential driveway standards. Nonresidential driveways (other than single-family detached uses) shall provide uninterrupted ingress/egress to and from the site and shall conform to the following standards: 
                  a.  The minimum distance required is measured perpendicular from the street right-of-way line at the ingress/egress point to the nearest edge of any interior service drive or parking space with direct access to such. The length of the uninterrupted ingress/egress is determined by the maximum peak hour volume of the facility in which the driveway is provided and as shown in the table below. The developer shall provide this information. 
                  Table 11.4-1  Uninterrupted Ingress/Egress  Distances 

                   
                  b.  Non-residential driveways shall not be designed or marked to allow more than one lane of traffic to exit onto a street simultaneously, unless such driveway is channelized in accordance with traffic engineering design principles as applicable when designing channelized street intersections. 
                  c.  Width (measured from edge of pavement to edge of pavement): 
                  Table 11.4-2  Nonresidential Driveway Width 

                   
                  Notes: 
                  (1) Where no other access is provided a minimum width of 20 feet shall be required. 
                  (2) Additional width may be approved by the public works director based on an approved engineering design. 
                  d.  Entrance radii shall be based on the road classification at the proposed entrance location and shall conform to the requirements set forth in subsection 113-128(4) of these regulations. Entrance radii for right-in/right-out configurations shall comply with the requirements set forth in subsection 113-124(13). 
                  e.  Drainage. Consistent with existing drainage plan of the connecting public roadway unless other improvements are required for safety, hydrological and environmental considerations. 
                  f.  Driveway designs other than as provided within these regulations, i.e., median divided or additional lanes, are subject to consideration of the department of public works. 
                  (5)  Access limitations for development adjacent to thoroughfares. 
                  a.  All access points and driveways adjacent to thoroughfares may be subject to further restriction and consideration as may be deemed necessary by the GDOT and/or the city to ensure safe, functional design and efficient operation of the thoroughfares. 
                  b.  Access to all residential lots shall be from interior subdivision streets or roads. 
                  c.  If the closest intersection is or is likely to be signalized, traffic movements to and from any driveway within 250 feet of an intersection with (as measured from the point of tangency) a collector or an arterial shall be limited to right turns only. 
                  (6)  Median openings. 
                  a.  No median opening shall be spaced at a distance less than 660 feet from any other median opening (measured from centerline to centerline) unless specifically approved by the department of public works. 
                  b.  Other factors will also be considered, such as distance to other median openings, adjacent land use, expected traffic volumes, and the resulting volume of U-turns that are likely to occur without the median opening. Meeting the spacing criteria is not, in itself an indication that median openings will be allowed. 
                  c.  All median openings shall include full width storage and taper length in accordance with table 11.4-6 and 11.4-7 unless otherwise acceptable to the department of public works based on a traffic study. Increased storage and transition lengths may be required to eliminate disruption of through-traffic flow. Provide a minimum 12-foot pavement width, excluding curb and gutter. 
                  (7)  Spacing of signalized intersections. No signalized intersection shall be spaced at a distance less than 1,000 feet from any other signalized intersection (measured from centerline to centerline) unless specifically approved by the public works department. 
                  (8)  Auxiliary lanes (turn lanes and deceleration lanes). 
                  a.  Improvements required. When property that abuts upon an existing or proposed city road is to be developed or redeveloped and the city road will provide access to the property, access improvements to the city road (deceleration lanes, turn lanes, etc.) shall be provided by the developer at no cost to the city. 
                  1.  When any auxiliary turn lane that extends beyond the applicant property frontage, the applicant will be responsible for acquiring the necessary rights-of-way and easements in order to accomplish the necessary frontage improvements. 
                  2.  Existing utilities may be required to be relocated in accordance with subsection 113-141(1). 
                  b.  Deceleration lane. A deceleration lane shall be required at each project driveway or subdivision street entrance, as applicable, that meets either the average daily traffic (ADT) or right turning volumes shown in the following table. Passing lane sections fall under the criteria for two or more lanes. The public works director may require the construction of a deceleration lane even when the conditions in table 11.4-3 are not met, if roadway or field conditions indicate that the safety of the general public would be improved. 
                  Deceleration lanes required by this section shall meet the following requirements: 
                  1.  Deceleration lanes shall have a pavement width of 12 feet (exclusive of curb and gutter) and shall meet the following standards for storage and taper length: 
                  Table 11.4-3  Minimum Volumes Requiring  Deceleration Lanes 

                   
                  Table 11.4-4  Deceleration Lane Storage  and Taper Lengths 

                   
                    
                  2.  Additional right-of-way to accommodate the deceleration lane and an 11-foot shoulder shall be dedicated by the developer to the city at no cost. Associated drainage improvements as deemed necessary by the construction of the deceleration lane shall also be required. 
                  3.  Other access improvements may be required by the department of public works in order to ensure adequate site access, pedestrian access, convenience and safety to the motoring public. 
                  4.  The pavement specifications for deceleration lanes must comply with the GDOT standard specifications of roads and bridges, except as approved by the public works director. 
                  c.  Medians. In the event a street has an existing or proposed median, the opening will be reviewed in accordance with subsection (6) of this section. 
                  d.  Left turn lanes. Left turn lanes must be constructed at no cost to the city if either the ADT or left turning volumes shown in the following table are met. Passing lane sections fall under the criteria for two or more lanes. The public works director may also require the addition of a left turn lane, even when the conditions in the following table are not met, if roadway geometry or field conditions indicate that the safety of the traveling public would be improved. 
                  Table 11.4-5  Minimum Volumes Requiring  Left Turn Lanes 

                   
                  Left turn lanes required by this section shall meet the following requirements: 
                  1.  The design of left turn lanes should consider the intended function and the characteristics of the roadway. In many cases, it is necessary to widen the existing roadway to introduce the left turn lane. Left turn lanes shall be constructed at no cost to the city. 
                  2.  When the roadway has a median that is at least 20 feet wide, the left turn lane can be developed out of the median, avoiding the need for transitions. If a proposed driveway aligns across the main street with another driveway, and the proposed driveway must provide a left turn lane and left turn storage, then adequate storage and tapers must also be provided for the driveway across the main street. 
                  3.  The basic design elements of left turn lanes are illustrated in the following table. This example shows symmetrical widening, which basically requires the through traffic on each side to shift by one-half of the lane width. Some circumstances may dictate that all widening be achieved on one side, which requires a full lane shift for through traffic on the side where the additional width is developed.

                  4.  The required length of full-width storage is based on the peak hour traffic volumes. This should be determined in the traffic study. The amount of storage is dependent on the type of traffic control in effect. For signalized intersections, the storage should be sufficient to accommodate the 95th percentile peak hour queue. At yield-controlled intersections, the storage is based on the number of vehicles as designated in table 11.4-7. 
                  Table 11.4-7  Left Turn Storage  Requirements 

                   
                  e.  Relocation of utilities. The developer shall be responsible for the relocation of public or private utilities and drainage structures as may be occasioned by the required project access improvements. 
                  (9)  Left turning control radii. The path of the inside wheels during left turns is important for the design of median openings and intersections with dual left turn lanes. The following radii shall be used for the design of entrance improvements. 

                  Figure 11.4-2: Left Turning Control Radius

                  (10)  Corner sight distance. All driveways shall provide adequate corner sight distance in accordance with the standards established for an intersection as set forth in subsection 113-128(6). 
                  (11)  Separation and spacing. All driveways except those serving residential units on individual lots shall be recommended to meet the following criteria: 
                  a.  Spacing requirements, associated with the construction of new driveways, are provided in the following table 11.4-9. Driveways should be separated from any other facility, which accesses a city roadway, whether it is another driveway or a public street. Minimum spacing requirements also apply to driveways on the opposite side of undivided roadways. 

                  Figure 11.4-3: Spacing Criteria for Driveways 
                    
                  Table 11.4-9  Driveway Spacing Criteria 

                   
                  Notes: (1) Requirements for the length of right and left turn lanes, as shown in table 11.4-4 and table 11.4-6, may increase the minimum allowable spacing shown in table 11.4-9. 
                  b.  Spacing of one-way driveways. Figure 11.4-4 shows a typical layout of one-way driveways. The spacing criteria presented in table 11.4-9 does not apply to the distance between the two, one-way driveways (driveway pair). A driveway pair must be separated from another driveway pair by the distance as shown in table 11.4-9. A driveway pair must also be separated from an adjacent two-way driveway in accordance with the spacing criteria in table 11.4-9. 

                  Figure 11.4-4: Spacing Criteria for One-Way Driveways 
                  c.  Placement of driveways. Not only must driveways be spaced from other driveways as provided above, they must also be located a minimum distance from the property line. The radius return must be a minimum of five feet from the property line. Single-family detached residential driveways shall be located as provided in subsection (3) of this section. 
                  When driveways are to be jointly used by two or more property owners, the property line separation requirements given in the above paragraph can be waived. However, a joint use agreement signed by the affected property owners must be provided to the public works department. Either property owner may apply for the driveway permit. 
                  d.  Driveway spacing. Driveways should align with other driveways located on the opposite side of the roadway. If offset driveways cannot be avoided, the same driveway spacing criteria as given in table 11.4-9 should be provided, to provide space for left turns. Figure 11.4-5 shows how the spacing is measured for locating offset driveways on undivided roadways. Spacing is from center to center. 

                  Figure 11.4-5: Spacing of Offset Driveways 
                  If the city roadway involved is a divided facility and the driveways do not align with a median crossover, the driveway spacing would only apply to the adjacent driveway located on the same side of the roadway as shown above in figure 11.4-5. 
                  Meeting the spacing criteria is not, in itself an indication that driveways will be allowed. 
                  e.  Maximum number of driveways serving a single project: one for each full 200 feet of property frontage This is not meant to be a spacing standard but only an expression of the maximum number of driveways that are permitted serving a single project. 
                  (12)  Raised islands. Raised islands associated with entrance improvements shall be designed in accordance with the standards provided in subsection 113-128(5). 
                  (13)  Right-in, right-out driveways. 
                  a.  Raised islands are also typically used to channelize the movements at a driveway where only right turns are allowed. The raised island is an effective means of preventing left turns. All right-in, right-out islands must have a radius that is 70 feet, or a compound curve that approximates 70 feet. 
                  b.  Right-in, right-out driveways are not intended for truck traffic, so the exit and entrance lanes must be 12 feet in width as measured from face of curb to face of curb. The island must be constructed from mountable curb (three inches vertical, 45 degree face, three inches flat) to accommodate emergency vehicles. The edge of the island should be offset 18 inches to 24 inches from the edge of the travel lane. 
                  (14)  Pavement design. 
                  a.  All construction, within the right of way, of surfaces intended for travel by motorized vehicles shall be paved. The pavement specification of auxiliary lanes on city roadways shall be the GDOT Standard Specifications for Construction of Roads and Bridges, or as designated in city standards, whichever is more restrictive. 
                  b.  New developments are required to widen the road along their frontage to a uniform lane width of 12 feet. If the widened area is two feet or less in width, a concrete sub-base should be provided per the current standards. The developer must then either pave the entire width of the road, or mill to the centerline and pave to match the existing road. Transitions shall be milled a minimum of 25 feet. Any deviation from this standard requires a waiver from the public works director. 
                  c.  When pavement construction requires the installation of an overlay, the overlay shall comply with subsection 113-129(3) of these regulations. 
                  (15)  Pedestrian considerations. When driveways are constructed in areas where pedestrian activity is not prohibited, the design should adequately provide for pedestrian movement and interaction with vehicular traffic. Pedestrian features that should be considered include sidewalks, multi-use trails, crosswalks, traffic control features, curb ramps and detectable warning strips where required. The Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines must be utilized where pedestrian traffic is expected. 
                  (16)  Traffic impact studies. Any proposed site plan or subdivision plan which would be expected to generate over 100 total trips during the peak hour of the traffic generator or the peak hour on the adjacent streets, or over 750 trips in an average day shall submit a traffic impact study in accordance with the city standards. In addition, the city may find that proposed or existing site conditions may warrant the submission of a traffic impact study even when the above thresholds are not exceeded. Those conditions may include, but not be limited to the following: 
                  a.  High traffic volumes on surrounding roads that my affect movement to and from the proposed development. 
                  b.  Lack of existing left turn lanes on the adjacent roadway at the proposed access drive. 
                  c.  Inadequate sight distance at access points. 
                  d.  The proximity of the proposed access points to other existing drives or intersections. 
                  e.  A development that includes a drive-through operation 
                  (Ord. No. 2009-06-18, (11.4), 6-29-2009) 
                  Sec. 113-125. - General layout requirements. 
                  (1)  Conformance. The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade, and location of all streets shall conform at a minimum to the comprehensive plan and these regulations. 
                  (2)  Local streets and collectors. Local streets shall be laid out so that their use by through traffic will be discouraged. Collectors shall be provided to channel through traffic movements within a development, where appropriate to the design and a major thoroughfare is not proposed by the comprehensive plan. Collectors also may be provided as central routes within large residential subdivisions, where appropriate to the design, based on project traffic demands exceeding 4,000 trips per day (ADT). However, this is not intended to eliminate interparcel access or desirable connectivity as required in section 113-123(2). 
                  (3)  Cul-de-sac and dead end streets or alleys. 
                  a.  Maximum length without an approved turnaround. Dead end streets or alleys more than 150 feet in length, as measured from the centerline of the intersecting street to the end of the improved access road, shall provide a cul-de-sac turnaround. Alternative turnarounds may be provided as approved by the fire marshal and the public works director. 
                  b.  Minimum street length. The minimum street length for a cul-de-sac street shall be 50 feet. 
                  c.  Maximum design length. Cul-de-sac or dead end streets may be no more than 600 feet in length as measured from the nearest intersection. Additional length necessitated by topography or property configuration may be approved by the public works director. 
                  d.  Measurement of cul-de-sac length. The length of a cul-de-sac street shall be measured along the centerline from the point of tangency of the entrance radius to the point of curvature for the cul-de-sac radius return. 
                  e.  Eyebrow cul-de-sacs. Eyebrow cul-de-sac (half cul-de-sacs) will not be permitted at "right-angled" intersections. Eyebrow cul-de-sacs shall only be allowed on a tangent or straight road section or on curves meeting the minimum standards of subsection 113-127(3). 
                  f.  Conformance to standard drawings. Cul-de-sacs shall conform to the layout and dimensional requirements as shown in the standard drawings. 
                  g.  Cul-de-sacs with landscape islands. Non-standard cul-de-sacs will be evaluated individually and may be constructed with a landscaped island (subject to approval by the fire marshal and the public works director) to be maintained by the home-owners association in perpetuity. 
                  h.  Minimum cul-de-sac radius. Minimum cul-de-sac radii shall be 50 feet. 
                  (4)  Other dead end streets. 
                  a.  A dead end street shall be provided to the boundary of a subdivision where necessary to provide access to a land-locked abutting property, for planned continuity of future circulation, for improved access for public safety vehicles, or for the extension of public water or other utilities to neighboring lands. Such dead end streets shall be designed so as to allow their reasonable extension, and shall be located so as to be reasonably incorporated into a street design for the neighboring property. The stub street requirement may be waived by the public works director, provided the fire marshal concurs. 
                  b.  Dead end streets on abutting property shall be extended into a proposed subdivision and incorporated into the street design of the development. This requirement may be modified by the director in cases of serious topographical hardship or dissimilar zoning which would create unacceptable land use conflicts between the two developments. This modification may be conditioned on the provision of easements necessary for the extension of public utilities, the provision of cul-de-sac or other permanent turnaround on the dead end street, or the removal of the dead end street back to its nearest intersection. 
                  c.  Where a dead end street (other than a cul-de-sac) serves more than three lots, the developer shall be required to provide a temporary vehicular turnaround within the right-of-way. This requirement may be waived if extension of the dead end street is approved and under construction prior to its inclusion in a final plat. 
                  d.  Where a street dead ends at the property boundary and the street exceeds the maximum cul-de-sac length a permanent cul-de-sac shall be required. In this situation, right-of-way to the property boundary shall be required, but the pavement shall not be extended to the property boundary beyond the edge of the paved cul-de-sac turnaround. 
                  (5)  Service roads. 
                  a.  Where a development borders on or contains a railroad right-of-way, or limited access highway right-of-way or major thoroughfare, a public street may be required to be constructed and dedicated within the development approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way. 
                  b.  All driveways along designated thoroughfares with existing or planned service roads shall provide access to such service roads. To gain temporary direct access to the thoroughfare, the developer shall construct the section of the service road adjacent to the development. The service road section shall be located where planned. Any right-of-way not previously dedicated shall be dedicated prior to consideration of a temporary driveway approval providing direct access to the thoroughfare. 
                  (6)  Half-streets. Half-streets (new boundary streets having one-half of the minimum required right-of-way or pavement width) shall not be allowed nor access to same be permitted should it exist. 
                  (7)  Reserve strips. Land in private ownership adjacent to public rights-of-way which could control or are intended to control access to streets, alleys, or public lands shall not be permitted unless their control is given to the city under ownership, dedication, or easement conditions approved by the city attorney or acceptable to the public works director. No development shall be designed so as to deny access to abutting properties. 
                  (8)  Alleys. Alleys shall not be provided except where the developer produces evidence satisfactory to the public works director of the need for same. In the event the public works director approves a design which proposes alleys, the alley shall be constructed as though it were a local street (except where a specific standard for alley exists) pursuant to the standards contained in these regulations, including fire apparatus turn around as required in subsection (3) of this section. 
                  Refer to subsection 113-126(1) for additional information on required pavement widths for alleys. 
                  (9)  Street jogs. Streets shall be aligned as per driveways as shown on table 11.4-9. 
                  (10)  Traffic calming. Where residential streets are longer than 600 feet, traffic calming devices may be incorporated as required by the public works director. The design of all measures shall comply with the applicable standards for the construction of such measures. 
                  (11)  Bike lanes . When required, the developer shall dedicate sufficient right-of-way to the city, or applicable entity, and install the necessary pavement and other improvements for the construction of bicycle lanes in locations as may be required by the director. Bicycle lanes shall be a minimum of four feet in width as measured from the edge of pavement, not including curb and gutter, and constructed in accordance with the AASHTO Guide for the Development of Bicycle Facilities, latest edition, and the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways, latest edition. 
                  (12)  Bus shelters. When required, the developer shall provide bus shelters within or adjacent to the right-of-way which are in compliance with the design standards of the local transit authority and as approved by the city. The public works director may require the construction of turnout areas, widened shoulders or other facilities necessary to accommodate the loading and unloading of passengers. 
                  (Ord. No. 2009-06-18, (11.5), 6-29-2009) 
                  Sec. 113-126. - Minimum right-of-way and street improvements. 
                  (1)  Right-of-way and pavement widths . 
                  a.  Minimum right-of-ways shall be as shown on the following table or per the city right-of-way plan, unless otherwise approved by the public works director. 
                  Table 11.6-1  Minimum Right-of-Way  Per Street Classification 

                   
                  b.  Additional street right-of-way width may be required to be dedicated at intersections or other locations fronting the property where turning lanes, storage lanes, medians, realignments, sidewalks, multi-use trails, utilities or other necessary improvements are required and minimum right-of-way standards would be inadequate to accommodate the improvements. 
                  c.  A minimum of ten-foot travel lanes are required on all streets, except for alleys where the principal structure may also be served by a higher classification street. Roadway widths and lane assignments are typically based upon the functional classification of said roadway, but in no case shall those widths be less than shown in the following table, unless otherwise approved by the public works director: 
                  Table 11.6-2  Minimum Pavement Widths 

                   
                  Notes: 
                  1.  Lane widths exclude curb and gutter. 
                  2.  Additional pavement width may be required in areas where bicycle lanes are to be installed. 
                  3.  Expressed as total paved width of the alley, excluding curb and gutter, if required. 
                  d.  Median divided roadways may be required with left-turn bays and median breaks in lieu of center two-way left turn lanes. 
                  e.  Existing streets shall be continued at the same or greater width, but in no case shall it be less than the required width provided herein. Where street widths change an appropriate transition shall be provided as approved by the public works director. 
                  (2)  Street rights-of-way. 
                  a.  Dedication of street right-of-way. Right-of-way for all public streets, existing and proposed shall be dedicated in accordance with the street classifications as shown on the functional classification map of the comprehensive plan and in accordance with these regulations. Right-of-way dedications shall be made prior to the approval of a final plat or, where a final plat is not involved, prior to the issuance of a land disturbance permit, unless otherwise approved by the public works director. 
                  b.  Right-of-way for projects adjacent to comprehensive plan projects. If a new street or thoroughfare is proposed by the comprehensive plan or the State of Georgia to adjoin or traverse the property, permits shall not be issued until the department has submitted the project to the mayor and city council for review in order to seek a determination if the city should acquire the right-of-way or if a study of alternate routes should be undertaken. The review period by the city shall not exceed 90 days from the date of permit application. If, after the 90-day review, the mayor and city council is unable to reach a decision, there shall not be any further delay of a requested permit for this situation. 
                  c.  Right-of-way for projects adjacent to funded roadway projects. If a new street or thoroughfare is funded by the city or the State of Georgia to adjoin or traverse the property, the proposed road right-of-way shall be incorporated into the development plans of the property in accordance with these regulations. The right-of-way requirements contained in these regulations shall govern except where there exists clearly defined plans of GDOT or the city, which require additional right-of-way. In that case, the greater right-of-way requirements shall govern. 
                  d.  Right-of-way for projects adjacent to designed roadway projects. Any development with property fronting on an existing city road for which there exists clearly defined plans by the GDOT or the city, may be required to provide road improvements associated with the defined plans or, in lieu of the design and construction, at the discretion of the director, the developer may be required escrow the dollar equivalency of required improvements (including curbing, utility relocation, and drainage structures, etc., as estimated by the developer and verified by the public works department. These funds shall be deposited in the appropriate road construction account prior to the approval of development improvements or within 30 days of city award of a construction contract, whichever occurs first. 
                  e.  Dedication of minimum required right-of-way for abutting streets. On any existing street that abuts a property and does not meet the minimum right-of-way requirements as established in these regulations, one-half of the required width of right-of-way shall be dedicated at no cost to the city as measured from the centerline of the roadway prior to the issuance of a land disturbance permit for that property. 
                  f.  Location of the right-of-way. Except where it can be shown to be in the best interest of the safety, health and welfare of the general public or specifically approved by the public works department the location of the right-of-way shall be located as follows: 
                  1.  The right-of-way shall be parallel to the back of curb and be mitered at intersections to provide adequate area for utilities, sidewalk, multi-use trails, sight distance and maintenance of the right-of-way. 
                  2.  Right-of-way shall be located a minimum of 11 feet from the back-of-curb or one-foot from the back of sidewalk/multi-use trail, whichever is greater, to prevent interference or encroachment by fencing, walls, hedges and other planting or structures that may be placed on the adjacent property line at a later date. 
                  [g.]  Right-of-way setback adjacent to residentially zoned property. The right-of-way for new public streets or the easement/common area for new private streets must be located a minimum of 50 feet from any peripheral property line adjoining residentially zoned property unless inter-parcel access is required. This setback shall comply with the provisions of subsection 113-125(7) for reserve strips. 
                  [h.]  Minimum right-of-way miters. Miters shall comply with the following minimum standards, the miter distances shall be measured along the right-of-way from the point of intersection of the two rights-of-way if they were extended: 
                  1.  Twenty-foot miters (minimum) shall be provided at the right-of-way intersection of any major thoroughfare. 
                  2.  Ten-foot miters (minimum) shall be provided at the right-of-way intersection of any local roads. 
                  (3)  Reserved. 
                  (4)  Improvements along state highways. For any development which abuts a state highway or other right-of-way controlled by the State of Georgia, improvements to the roadway and the location and design of any street or driveway providing access from the state highway shall comply with the standards and requirements of GDOT or the city public works department, with the more restrictive requirements controlling. The proposed access or improvements shall be required to have been approved by GDOT and incorporated into the construction drawings for the project prior to issuance of a land disturbance permit by the department.

                  Sec. 113-127. - Roadway design. 
                  (1)  Street grades and design speeds. 
                  a.  Minimum grade. Minimum grade for all local streets shall be 1.5 percent. Minimum grades for all collector and arterial streets shall conform to GDOT practice. 
                  Minimum grades of less than 1.5 percent on a local street may be approved by the department, based on adequate engineering designs, where at least 1.5 percent cannot reasonably be achieved due to topographical limitations imposed by the land. In such cases, a record drawing and such computations as necessary shall be provided after construction to establish that the street will drain in accordance with these regulations. Street sections where unacceptable pooling, excessive spread at catch basins, or other hazardous conditions occur shall be reconstructed or otherwise improved to eliminate such conditions. 
                  b.  Maximum grade and design speed. Minimum vehicle design speeds and maximum grades allowable in the city by street classification shall be as shown in the following table. 
                  Table 11.7-1  Minimum Design Speeds  and Maximum Grades 

                   
                  Notes: 
                  1.  Maximum grade in excess of those listed above may be approved by the public works director in order to address topographical, safety, hydrological, and environmental concerns. 
                  2.  Minimum design speed shall be determined by the public works director. 
                  3.  Grades between 12 percent and 14 percent shall be limited to a maximum length of 150 feet. The distance shall be measured as the tangent length between points of curvature. 
                  c.  Maximum grade for cul-de-sac. Maximum grade on any cul-de-sac turnaround shall be six percent. 
                  d.  Roadway cross slope. The standard roadway cross slope is two percent down from crown to gutter line or edge of pavement. In areas where pavement width is being added to an existing street, the additional pavement shall match the cross slope of the existing roadway. 
                  (2)  Vertical street alignment. 
                  a.  Requirements for vertical curves. All changes in street profile grades having algebraic difference greater than one percent shall be connected by a parabolic curve having a minimum length (L) equal to the product of the algebraic difference between the grades in percent (A) and the design constant (K) assigned to the street according to its category (i.e., L=KA). 
                  b.  Required K values.

                  c.  Minimum vertical curve length. The minimum length of vertical curve required for safe stopping sight distance shall be calculated using AASHTO "Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets", latest edition. 
                  (3)  Horizontal street alignment. 
                  a.  Minimum horizontal curves and superelevation. All new streets shall adhere to the following standards governing horizontal curvature and super elevation: 
                  Table 11.7-3  Horizontal Curves 

                   
                  Notes: 
                  1.  No super elevation will be allowed on collectors internal to residential subdivisions. 
                  b.  Calculation of super-elevation. Super-elevation for horizontal curves shall be calculated utilizing the following formula: 
                  R= v 2 /(15 (e + f) ) where: 
                  R = minimum radius curve 
                  v = vehicle design speed (MPH) 
                  e = rate of super-elevation (decimal of a foot rise per foot roadway) 
                  f = side friction factor 

                   
                  c.  Super-elevation when widening existing streets. Widening section along existing streets shall be designed reflecting existing curvature and super elevation, if any, unless the existing street has been included in a specific design by the city or GDOT which calls for different standards, in which case the project will be coordinated with the overall design. 
                  d.  Super elevation runoff. Roadway edge curves shall be provided for tangent run out (bringing edge from a normal crown to centerline elevation) and super elevation runoff (from the end of tangent run out to the point of design super elevation) in accordance with design standards of GDOT or other professional engineering standards. 
                  e.  Tangents and compound curves. Between reverse horizontal curves there shall be not less than the minimum centerline tangents shown in table 11.7-4 unless otherwise specified by GDOT. Compound radii curves are prohibited. For compound circular curves that cannot be avoided, the ratio of the flatter radius to the sharper radius shall not exceed 1.5 to one. 
                  Table 11.7-4  Tangents 

                   
                    
                  (4)  Horizontal and vertical clearances. 
                  a.  Horizontal clearances. 
                  1.  Shoulder width. A shoulder of no less than 11 feet from the back of curb or edge of pavement, appropriately graded and having gentle slopes of not more than 0.5 inch per foot and rounded cross-sectional design shall be maintained along all streets. Beyond the shoulder but within the right-of-way, slopes shall not exceed one foot of rise for each two feet of horizontal distance on a cut slope, and one foot of fall for each three feet of horizontal distance on a fill slope. 
                  2.  Clear zone. Experience has shown that motorists occasionally run off the roadway and providing a traversable recovery area can lesson serious injury. AASHTO publishes a roadside design guide that should be used as a reference when designing driveways. 
                  The following table provides the clear zone distances as contained in the roadside design guide. Driveways must be designed so that all areas within the roadway right-of-way have clear zones as defined in the following table. 
                  Table 11.7-5 Clear Zone Distance  (Distances are Measured in Feet)  (From AASHTO 2002 Roadside Design Guide ) 

                   
                  Notes: 
                  * Clear zones may be limited to 30 feet 
                  ** Fixed objects should not be present in the vicinity of the toe of these slopes. The width of the recovery zones should consider a number of factors including right of way availability, economic factors, safety needs, and accident history. 
                  All areas located within the clear zones should remain clear of obstructions such as bridge abutments, poles, trees, etc. If obstructions are unavoidable, the design should include appropriate protection such as break-away design, guardrail installation, safety end treatments on culverts, etc. The roadway design guide includes a table for horizontal curve adjustments, where the clear zone correction factor is applied to the outside of curves only. Curves flatter than a 2,860 foot radius do not require an adjusted clear zone. 
                  3.  Increased clear zone in certain locations. At selected locations, such as the outside of a sharp curve, a wider clear zone with greater horizontal clearances to any roadside obstruction may be required. 
                  4.  Removal of obstructions. The department of public works, in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 32-6-51 and these development regulations, is authorized to remove or direct the removal of any sign, signal, device, vegetation, or other structure erected, placed, or maintained on the right-of-way of a public road which because of its nature, construction, or operation, constitutes a danger to, or interferes with the vision of, drivers of motor vehicles. 
                  b.  Vertical clearances. Vertical clearance for all overhead obstructions shall be at least 16 feet over the entire roadway width. 
                  Additional clearance may be required for obstructions over railroads, state or federal roadways or other transportation routes. 
                  (Ord. No. 2009-06-18, (11.7), 6-29-2009) 
                  Sec. 113-128. - Street intersections. 
                  (1)  General requirements. Street intersections shall be consistent with the applicable requirements for driveways as determined by the public works director and as set forth in section 113-124. 
                  (2)  Intersection approaches; horizontal alignment. 
                  a.  New local streets which approach an intersection with a street in a category higher than itself on a horizontal curve having a centerline radius less than 240 feet shall provide a tangent section of roadway at least 30 feet long. Collectors approaching an intersection with a major thoroughfare on a horizontal curve having a centerline radius of less than 550 feet shall also provide the 30-foot tangent section. The tangent length shall be measured along the centerline of the street, from the right-of-way line of the intersecting street, extended, to the point of tangency with the centerline of the curve section. 
                  b.  New major thoroughfares shall provide tangent sections at intersections with streets in equal or higher categories as needed to provide adequate stopping distances at their design speeds. 
                  (3)  Intersection approaches; Vertical alignment. 
                  a.  Approach landings at local streets. For new street intersections with local streets, a leveling of the street at a grade not exceeding three percent shall be provided for a distance of not less than 50 feet as measured from the back of curb of the intersecting street. 
                  b.  Approach landings at collectors or arterials. As a street approaches an intersection with a collector or arterial, there shall be a suitable leveling of the street at a grade not exceeding two percent and for a distance not less than the following minimums: 
                  Table 11.8-1  Approach Distances at  Major Intersections 

                   
                  Notes: 
                  1.  Distance of the approach is measured from edge of pavement of the intersecting street to the point of curvature in the approaching street. 
                  (4)  Intersection radii. 
                  a.  Intersection radii for roadways as measured at back of curb and for the right-of-way lines shall be as follows. The minimum roadway radii for the intersection of local and non-residential local streets is 25 feet. For all other roadway classifications the minimum roadway radii is 50 feet. When a local or residential collector intersects a higher classification of roadway, the radii shall be a minimum of 50 feet. Larger radii may be required for streets intersecting at an angle of less than 90° or when vehicle and operating circumstances dictate. As approved by the public works director, the radii can be reduced a maximum of five feet for the following reasons: 
                  1.  Separation from street; or 
                  2.  Removal of obstruction. 
                  b.  Intersecting right-of-way lines shall be joined by a miter which cuts across the right-of-way lines connecting the points where the required radius would have otherwise been tangent. Miters shall be measured as provided in subsection 113-126(2)h. 
                  (5)  Islands. 
                  a.  Islands in street intersections shall conform to the design requirements of the standard drawings. In no case shall anything in an island in the right-of-way extend more than three feet above the street grade within the right-of-way, except traffic regulatory devices and other infrastructure erected or approved by the city. No island shall be approved which contains less than 100 square feet for median islands or 50 square feet for corner islands. 
                  b.  Islands within the right-of-way or access easements shall be constructed with mountable curb sections per GDOT specifications, unless otherwise approved by the public works director. 
                  c.  Islands are an important form of intersection channelization that is often needed to prohibit undesirable movements, define the paths of allowed movements, and provide a refuge area for pedestrians. Any location where two outbound lanes are proposed for a driveway at an un-signalized location, the right line must be for right-out only movement, and separated from the other lane by a raised island. 
                  d.  Painted lines are an effective means to direct the paths of vehicular movement. However, raised islands are more effective during times when visibility is reduced. When islands are to serve as pedestrian refuge areas, they should be constructed as raised islands. All sign posts to be placed within concrete area must have hole through pavement structure. The hole may be either formed, drilled or sawed. 
                  e.  When multiple crosswalks are required to pass through islands, the required size may exceed the 100 square feet mentioned above. The additional area may be required to install wheelchair ramps. As an alternate to ramps, the pedestrian travel way can be "slotted" through the island, remaining on the grade of the roadway. 
                  f.  Raised islands should be offset from the edge of the adjacent travel lane on all sides. The amount of offset shall be a minimum of 18 inches as measured from the edge of the travel lane to the face of the curb. When raised islands are adjacent to roadways with posted speed limits of 50 m.p.h. or greater, the island shall be offset from the edge of the roadway by a minimum distance of ten feet. 
                  (6)  Intersection sight distance. 
                  a.  Intersections shall be designed with adequate corner sight distance. Where necessary, back slopes shall be flattened and horizontal or vertical curves lengthened to provide the minimum required sight distance. 
                  b.  The minimum intersection sight distance requirement may be calculated using AASHTO "Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets," chapter 9 (Intersections), latest edition. Intersection sight distance is determined with an assumed height of driver's eye of 3.5 feet and an assumed height of object of 3.5 feet when measuring in the vertical plane. When measuring in the horizontal plane, the intersection sight distance is determined with an assumed driver's eye location from a point four feet offset from the centerline and 15 feet from the edge of closest travel lane to a point along the centerline of the closest oncoming travel lane. When measuring in either plane, the line of sight must remain within the proposed standard dedicated right-of-way: 

                  Figure 11.8-1: Design Elements for  Intersection Sight Distance 
                  Table 11.8-2  Minimum Intersection  Sight Distance 

                   
                  Notes: 
                  1.  SDL refers to "sight distance to the left" and SDR refers to "sight distance to the right." 
                  2.  Minimum intersection sight distance for stopped passenger vehicles turning onto a roadway with no median and grades of three percent or less. Distances shall be adjusted for entering roadways with different design characteristics. 
                  (7)  Obstructing visibility at intersections. On any corner lot, within an area formed by the lot lines on the street sides of such lot and a line (miter) joining points on such lot lines located at a distance of 20 feet from the point of their intersection, the following shall apply: 
                  a.  There shall be no fence or wall or hedge higher than three feet. 
                  b.  There shall be no obstruction to vision, other than a post or column or tree (except standards erected by city) exceeding one foot in greatest cross-sectional dimension, between a height of three feet and a height of 15 feet above the established grade of either of the intersecting streets. 
                  c.  The public works director may require additional restrictions based on the horizontal or vertical curvature of the roadway or any unique features of the intersection. 
                  (8)  Turning lanes at intersections. Left turning lanes shall be provided on all new internal project streets, classified as a collector or higher, intersecting a major thoroughfare, and may be required in other locations to meet traffic demand and safe operations. Right turning lanes may be required to meet traffic demands or safety concerns. When provided, turning lanes shall meet the criteria for turn lanes in subsection 113-124(8). 
                  (Ord. No. 2009-06-18, (11.8), 6-29-2009) 
                  Sec. 113-129. - Street construction. 
                  (1)  Sub-grade preparation for all streets. Street construction shall be done in accordance to GDOT standards or these regulations, with the more restrictive requirements controlling. 
                  a.  Preparation. Sub-grade preparation shall be in accordance with GDOT specifications and these regulations. 
                  b.  Unsuitable material. If any sections of the sub-grade are composed of topsoil, organic, or other unsuitable or unstable material, such material shall be removed and replaced with suitable material and then thoroughly compacted as specified for fill or stabilized with stone or a geo-textile or geo-grid as approved by the director. 
                  c.  Compaction. Fill shall be placed in uniform, horizontal layers not more than eight inches thick (loose measurement). Moisture content shall be adjusted as necessary to compact material to 95 percent maximum laboratory dry density and the top 12 inches to 100 percent maximum laboratory dry density as determined by AASHTO method T-99. 
                  d.  Utility installation. After the earthwork has been completed, all storm drainage, water, and sanitary sewer utilities have been installed within the right-of-way as appropriate, and the backfill in all such ditches thoroughly compacted, the sub-grade shall be brought to the lines, grades, and typical roadway section shown on the plans. 
                  e.  Compaction testing. Utility trenches cut in the sub-grade shall be backfilled as specified herein. Compaction tests at the rate of one per 150 feet of trench may be required to verify compaction. 
                  f.  Proof-roll. The sub-grade must pass roll testing with a fully loaded dump truck prior to placement of the base material. With the approval of the department, a geo-textile or grid may be used to stabilize a sub-grade that does not pass proof rolling. 
                  g.  Use of roads as construction roads. When the street is to be used for construction traffic before the paving work is completed, a layer of stone (except crusher run) shall be laid as a traffic surface. This material shall not be used as a part of the base material. It may be worked into the sub-grade, or it shall be removed before the base course is set up for paving. 
                  h.  Temporary drainage. Provisions shall be made to drain low points in the road construction when the final paving is delayed. A break in the berm section is required when the curbing has not been constructed. After installation, drainage under the curb to side slopes is required, using minimum four inch diameter pipe sections. 
                  (2)  Base preparation for all streets. 
                  a.  Crushed stone base. 
                  1.  Base preparation shall be in accordance with GDOT specifications and these regulations. The base material must pass roll testing with a fully loaded dump truck prior to placement of the paving material. 
                  2.  Base course thickness shall be in accordance with subsection (3) of this section. 
                  3.  Lay one course to a maximum depth of eight inches. If the required depth exceeds eight inches construct two or more courses of equal thickness. Moisture content shall be adjusted as necessary to compact material to 100 percent maximum laboratory dry density as determined by AASHTO method T-180. 
                  b.  Prime coat. 
                  1.  If a delay in paving is reasonably expected by the developer or the city, the base shall be primed with 0.25 gallon of R.C. 70 per square yard the same day it is compacted, and cured for seven days prior to paving. 
                  2.  Prime coats may also be required for cement or lime stabilized bases or sub-bases, regardless of pavement thickness. 
                  3.  Prime coats shall not be applied to a wet surface, in air temperatures less than 40 degrees F in the shade or if rain is imminent. 
                  c.  Soil cement subgrade. 
                  1.  If the subgrade material (resident soil) is unsatisfactory to the city then a soil cement mix design with engineer test results acceptable to the city may be used. The design must come from a geo-technical firm with the results certified by a professional engineer registered in the State of Georgia. The tests required for the design are ASTM D558 or AASHTO T134 or ASTM D559 and/or 560 or ASHTO T135 and 136. 
                  2.  The minimum base course shall consist of at least six inches of suitable soil (high mica content not suitable) stabilized with ten percent of Portland cement by volume (approximately 42.3 pounds per sq. yd.). Where the grade of the street is five percent or greater, a single surface treatment course must be applied before the binder. 
                  (3)  Paving standards for all streets. 
                  a.  Asphalt streets. 
                  1.  Asphalt paving installation shall be in accordance with GDOT specifications and these regulations. Asphalt paving shall not be installed directly on the sub-grade. A graded aggregate base shall be installed in accordance with these and GDOT specifications for all asphalt paving sections. 
                  2.  All pavement sections shall be designed by a qualified, registered professional engineer based on the 20-year projected traffic loads for that section. The minimum acceptable pavement sections shall be defined as follows: 
                  Table 11.9-1  Minimum Construction Standards (1) 

                   
                  Notes: 
                  1.  Unless otherwise specified by the public works department or GDOT. 
                  2.  Binder course shall consist of four inches 25 mm Superpave base and two inches of 19 mm Superpave binder. 
                  b.  Concrete streets. On residential streets five inches of 3500 psi concrete is to be applied on a stabilized and compacted sub-grade with six inches of compacted GAB, or seven inches of compacted GAB on all other streets. The design and construction of the street shall comply with GDOT standards. Use of concrete streets requires the approval of the public works director. 
                  c.  Pavement overlays. Where pavement overlays are required they shall comply with the following standards: 
                  1.  Finished surface shall be a maximum height of 1.5 inches above the edge of the existing curb and gutter or shoulder, where curb and gutter has not been provided. Edge grinding shall be required in accordance with this section to meet this standard. 
                  2.  When edge grinding has been required it shall be performed for a minimum distance of seven feet along the edges/sides and ten feet at the ends of all overlay sections. Edge grinding shall be performed to a minimum depth of one inch ± 0.25 inch. 
                  3.  At the direction of the city inspectors all base failures, rutting, cracking and potholes etc. within the area of the overlay section shall be repaired in accordance with GDOT standards prior to resurfacing. 
                  4.  A tack coat shall be applied to all surfaces to be overlaid, in accordance with GDOT standards. 
                  (4)  Local residential-rural streets. Where allowed local residential-rural streets do not require curb and gutter. The road base shall be extended one foot beyond the edge of pavement, and the shoulders shall extend eight feet from the edge of pavement to a standard ditch section on each side (see standard drawings). Otherwise, the roadway shall comply with the standards for new residential subdivision streets, above. 
                  (Ord. No. 2009-06-18, (11.9), 6-29-2009) 
                  Sec. 113-130. - Curb and gutter. 
                  (1)  General requirements. 
                  a.  Curb and gutter required. All new streets and access improvements shall be provided with curb and gutter except where approved for a rural road section by the department of public works. All areas approved for use of the rural road section shall provide appropriate roadside drainage facilities designed in accordance with the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual as adopted by the city. All gutters shall drain smoothly with no areas of ponding. 
                  b.  Alternative curb and gutter design. Alternative curbing designs such as rolled back or vertical curbing without a gutter may be approved by the public works director when such designs are deemed appropriate for the type of development proposed. 
                  (2)  Local and collector road curbing. Local and collector road curbing shall meet the following requirements: 
                  a.  Concrete shall be class "A" (as defined by GDOT ) and have a minimum strength of 3,000 PSI at 28 days. 
                  b.  Typical minimum section shall be 6" x 24" X 12"(GDOT 24-inch type II). 
                  c.  Vertical curbing only, except where specific approval has been granted by the public works director for an alternate curb design. 
                  (3)  Arterial curbing. Arterial curbing shall meet the following requirements: 
                  a.  Concrete shall be class "A" (as defined by GDOT) and have a minimum strength of 3,000 PSI at 28 days. 
                  b.  Typical minimum section shall be 8" X 30" X 14" (GDOT 30-inch type II). 
                  c.  Vertical curbing only, except where mountable has been specified and approved by the public works director. 
                  (4)  Construction methods. 
                  a.  Curb and gutter shall be set true to line and grade, horizontal be field staked, and finished to the section shown on the plans. Along the frontage of a road which the city or GDOT has identified for resurfacing within one year of the new construction, the grade of the new gutter shall be placed one inch above the project access improvement pavement grade in areas where drainage will not be adversely affected. 
                  b.  Line and grade shall be set by developer's engineer or surveyor on grade less than two percent and over 12 percent, and within 100 feet in both directions from all low points. 
                  c.  One-half inch expansion joints or pre-molded bituminous expansion joint material shall be provided at all structures and radius points and at intervals not to exceed 250 feet in the remainder of the curb and gutter. 
                  d.  Inferior workmanship or unprofessional construction methods resulting in unacceptable curb and gutter will be cause for rejection of the finished work. 
                  e.  Disturbed areas along all curbing shall be backfilled, stabilized, and grassed. 
                  (Ord. No. 2009-06-18, (11.10), 6-29-2009) 
                  Sec. 113-131. - Sidewalks and multi-use trails. 
                  (1)  General requirements. 
                  a.  The location where multi-use trails shall be installed in lieu of sidewalks is shown on the future sidewalk and trail network map maintained by the department of public works. The director of public works may require the installation of additional sidewalks/multi-use trails where it may be deemed appropriate to provide connectivity to existing or proposed multi-use trail segments. 
                  b.  Sidewalks/multi-use trails and curb ramps shall be constructed along the entire property frontage in all new development or redevelopment and along all abutting or internal streets, existing or new, private or public. Where a sidewalk or multi-use trail is not shown on the future sidewalk and trial network map the director of public works may waive the required installation on the abutting street(s). Whenever a discrepancy occurs between the design and construction standards of this section and any state or federal regulation, then the most restrictive shall apply. 
                  c.  The director of public works may require the installation of sidewalks/multi-use trails, where appropriate, to provided pedestrian connectivity to adjacent parcels or projects. 
                  d.  Sidewalks/multi-use trails shall be installed within the right-of-way or within an easement specifically designated for sidewalk/multi-use trail use as approved by the city. 
                  (2)  Sidewalk/multi-use trail installation and timing. Sidewalks/multi-use trails shall be installed as follows: 
                  a.  Residential subdivision projects. Sidewalks/multi-use trails shall be installed on both sides of new internal public or private streets (including "eyebrow" turnarounds) and along the entire frontage of all abutting external streets (abutting side). Sidewalks are required on only one side of internal public or private streets in projects developed at densities of 1.5 units per acre or less or where it is determined by the director of public works that a sidewalk on one side of the street meets the intent of these requirements, i.e. a cul-de-sac street serving less than ten lots. Sidewalks/multi-use trails are required adjacent to cul-de-sac turnarounds in accordance with the standard drawings. 
                  1.  Residential subdivision developer responsibility. Developers shall install sidewalks/multi-use trails on abutting external streets as shown on the future sidewalk and trail network map, "passive" recreation area lots, and open space lots, and shall install intersection radius curb ramps at new street intersections, and L-shaped mid-block ramps at cul-de-sac turnarounds, prior to approval of the final plat. Sidewalks/multi-use trails on "active" recreation area lots shall be installed prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy or shall be installed by the developer prior to release of the subdivision maintenance surety agreement, whichever is earlier. Developers shall also install sidewalks/multi-use trails on any vacant lots remaining between developed lots (i.e. dwellings under construction or completed) prior to release of the subdivision maintenance surety agreement. 
                  2.  Homebuilder responsibility. Homebuilders shall install sidewalks/multi-use trails, and curb ramps not required to be installed by developers, on building lots prior to release of the certificate of occupancy for a home. 
                  b.  Nonresidential subdivision projects. Sidewalks/multi-use trails shall be installed on both sides of new internal streets (including cul-de-sac and "eyebrow" turnarounds) and along the entire frontage of all abutting external streets (abutting side) prior to approval of the final plat. 
                  c.  Non-subdivision projects. Sidewalks/multi-use trails shall be installed along the entire frontage of all abutting streets (abutting side) prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy or completion. 
                  d.  Drainage. Where sidewalk/multi-use is required and no curb and gutter exists the developer shall install all necessary drainage facilities, i.e. curb and gutter or swales. The facilities shall be constructed at the developers' expense to minimize the flow of water on or over the sidewalk/multi-use trail section and to comply with allowable gutter spread requirements. Where drainage swales are used the swale shall be located between the roadway and sidewalk section. 
                  e.  Maintenance surety agreement. Maintenance surety agreement provided to the city shall include the cost of sidewalk/multi-use trail construction in an amount acceptable to the city. 
                  f.  Escrow alternative. 
                  1.  The cost of sidewalk/multi-use trail installation may be set aside in escrow with the department of public works if proposed road improvements by the city or the Georgia Department of Transportation may impact the location of a sidewalk/multi-use trail. 
                  2.  Where the director of public works determines the topography of the road frontage is such that a special hardship exists on the property, he may authorize a payment to the city in lieu of the required installation of the sidewalk. Criteria shall be established for all such approved hardships by the director of public works to determine how the amount of payment will be calculated. Such criteria to determine the method of calculating such payment shall be approved by the city council and may be amended by the council thereafter upon recommendation of the director of public works or the city manager. 
                  (3)  Sidewalk/multi-use trail design and construction standards. Sidewalks/multi-use trails shall be constructed in accordance with the requirements of this section. The public works director is authorized to grant modifications upon specific application due to topographic or drainage difficulty as well as alternative design proposals. 
                  a.  Width. 
                  1.  Sidewalks shall be at least five feet wide on new internal subdivision streets. Sidewalks shall be at least five feet wide on abutting external streets. 
                  2.  Multi-use trails shall have a minimum width of ten feet. 
                  3.  If the street is part of an approved sidewalk, pathway or transportation plan then the width and location of the sidewalk shall conform to the requirements of the approved plan. 
                  b.  Shoulder. Sidewalk and multi-use trails shall be provided with a minimum graded shoulder width of two feet. When required to support alternative uses, i.e. equestrian, mountain bikes, etc., a five-foot graded shoulder may be required. The slope of the shoulder shall not exceed ± two percent. 
                  c.  Transitions. Where new sidewalks/multi-use trails tie in to existing sidewalks/multi-use trails of a different width or where the proposed sidewalk/multi-use trail must change width then the transition shall be made in a gradual manner at a rate of 5:1. Where this transition is made to tie in to an existing sidewalk/multi-use trail at a property boundary the full width sidewalk/multi-use trail shall extend along the entire length of the project site. 
                  d.  Non compliant sidewalks/multi-use trails. 
                  1.  All sidewalks/multi-use trails along a property frontage that do not meet the width standards as established in these regulations shall be brought in to compliance with these regulations. 
                  2.  When the public works director has determined that the existing sidewalk/multi-use trail is in satisfactory condition the additional width may be achieved by adding additional width to one side of the sidewalk/multi-use trail as approved. In no case shall this additional width be less than one foot. 
                  3.  In all areas where the condition of the sidewalk/multi-use trail is deemed unsatisfactory the existing sidewalk/multi-use trail shall be removed and replaced in conformance with these regulations.

Sidewalks/multi-use trails in subdivisions in which street trees are provided shall be located at least five feet from the back of curb (bridges excepted). Where no curb exists, or if road improvements are proposed for installation by the city, sidewalks/multi-use trails, including appropriate drainage facilities, shall be constructed in a location acceptable to the department of public works. 
                  2.  In areas where a setback from the curb cannot be provided due to unusual site conditions the department of public works may approve the installation of the sidewalk/multi-use trail at the back of curb. In these areas the sidewalk/multi-use trail width may be increased to allow a minimum of four feet of clearance from any portion of an obstruction that must be located adjacent to the roadway, i.e. mailboxes, etc… 
                  f.  Meandering sidewalks/multi-use trails. Meandering sidewalks/multi-use trails should be incorporated into the design when appropriate and when approved by the public works director. The design of the meanders shall be done in such a manner that the travel distance is not significantly increased for the general public. The public works director may also require meanders when it is deemed to be in the best interest of the city or where necessary to avoid obstructions in the right-of-way that may otherwise be too costly to relocate. 
                  g.  Cross slope. Sidewalks/multi-use trails shall be constructed with a maximum cross slope of two percent. Sidewalks/multi-use trails shall not exceed this cross slope at driveway crossings. 
                  h.  Running slope. The running slope of sidewalks/multi-use trails that are located adjacent to the roadway shall not exceed five percent. When the grade of the adjacent roadway is in excess of five percent the running slope of the sidewalk/multi-use trail may follow the general grade established for the adjacent roadway. 
                  i.  Material. 
                  1.  Sidewalks shall be constructed of concrete at least four inches thick and six inches thick across driveway sections. Concrete shall be class "B" (as defined by GDOT) with a minimum strength of 3,000 PSI at 28 days.

                  d.  Drainage easements for storm drain pipes shall be provided according to the minimum requirements found in the table below. The minimum easement width shall be 20 feet when no other parallel utilities are located therein. For pipe sizes not shown on the table below the easement width shall be based on the pipe diameter (span) plus two feet, plus two times the pipe invert depth. This value shall be rounded up to the nearest five feet. For pipes exceeding 16 feet in depth, a pre-submittal conference shall be held with the city to determine what additional requirements may be required. 
                  Table 12.6-1  Easements for Storm Drain Pipes 

                   
                  (2)  Common easements. A common easement for sanitary sewer and drainage purposes may be allowed if the pipes are parallel and at least ten feet is provided between pipes (outside of pipe to outside of pipe). The easement width shall be equal to the width shown in the table in subsection (1) of this section plus the distance separating the pipes (minimum of ten feet). 
                  (3)  Drainage easements for surface drainage. Drainage easements shall be provided where a development is traversed by or contains a water course, impoundment, detention facility, improved channel, floodplain, natural stream or channel. It shall conform substantially to the flooding limits of the 100-year storm based on fully developed conditions per the land use plan, but shall be no less than 20 feet in width. 
                  (4)  Obstruction of drainage easements. 
                  a.  The property owner will be required to keep the easement free of obstruction in such a way as to assure the maximum designed flow at all times. The property owner shall not alter any drainage improvements. Structures, except driveways, shall not be constructed or erected in an easement. Driveways shall cross an easement as close to perpendicular as practical. Fences in drainage easements may be accepted with approval from the public works director as long as the fence makes a perpendicular crossing of the easement and there are gates or removable panels within the easement. Property owners may plant landscaping in an easement that is piped with the approval of the city. Some landscape materials, such as large trees or shrubs, may not be appropriate for use within an easement. 
                  b.  No structure whatsoever shall be constructed in storm sewer easements that have been expressly dedicated to and accepted by the city, including vehicular easements around facilities without approval from the public works director. No planting shall take place within the easement that will impede access along the easement or endanger any infrastructure therein. No other pipeline or utility shall be placed in the easement without approval by the public works director. 
                  (5)  Stabilization of drainage easements. All drainage, sewer, access or other easements which were required to be cleared shall be fine graded, seeded and mulched immediately upon the completion of construction work or if any significant delay is anticipated in the completion of the work. The use of sediment control measures may be required to protect the area until a comprehensive vegetative cover is obtained. 
                  (6)  Placement of fill in drainage easements. No fill shall be placed on a storm sewer easement that have been expressly dedicated to and accepted by the city without approval from the public works director.

                  (Ord. No. 2009-06-18, (12.6), 6-29-2009; Ord. No. 2011-03-06, § 3, 3-28-2011) 
                  Sec. 113-147. - Street cuts. 
                  (1)  Review of utility plans. All utility construction plans within city right-of-way shall be reviewed and approved by the department before construction begins. A traffic control plan may be required as part of the submittal. Street cuts shall not be allowed unless deemed absolutely necessary due to the presence of rock, the need to tap into an existing line beneath the road surface, or other circumstance which makes boring impossible or infeasible. Where open trenching has been permitted the trench width shall be the minimum width necessary to allow for the installation of the conduit and provide adequate compaction of the backfill material. 
                  (2)  Marking of existing utilities. All existing utilities shall be properly marked in accordance with Georgia Utility Facility Protection Act prior to any excavation work. 
                  (3)  Maintaining access to private properties. Access to private driveways shall be provided at all times except during working hours when construction operations prohibit provision of such access. 
                  (4)  Obstruction of fire hydrants. Unobstructed access must be provided at all times to fire hydrants. 
                  (5)  Lane closure. Contact the department of public works at least 24 hours in advance of closure of traffic lanes. The applicant will be responsible for ensuring notice has been received by public works and should utilize verified e-mail notification. All lane closures shall be properly marked and signed with certified flagmen when appropriate. 
                  In trenching across the road, no more than one-half of the traveled way is to be closed to traffic at one time. 
                  (6)  Maximum length of open trench. The trench construction shall not be opened for a distance of more than 300 feet at any one time, unless specifically authorized by the public works director. 
                  (7)  Damage repair. Whenever a part of a block, square or section of curb, sidewalk, multi-use trail or driveway is broken or damaged by the person making any excavation or opening in or under any street, alley or public place, the entire block, square or section, shall be removed to the score, groove or saw cut line and replaced or reconstructed. Where the line of cut would be less than two feet from an existing expansion or weakened plan joint, the concrete shall be removed to said joint. 
                  (8)  Trench construction and backfill. 
                  Definitions and considerations. In trenched construction, bedding is the subgrade soil and its surface, as prepared to support the pipe. Backfill is the material refilling the rest of the level of top of pipe, and of overfill above that level. The latter may include restoration of surface soils or roadway materials. From the highway viewpoint, the essential features for trench and backfill construction are: 
                  a.  Entrenched roadbed; 
                  b.  Security of the pipe against deformation likely to cause leakage; and 
                  c.  Assurance against drainage being blocked by the backfill. Bedding is important for all pipes. 
                  Controls for trenched construction. Trenched construction, bedding, and backfill normally will be adequately controlled by the applicant conforming to the GDOT standard specifications for earth work and culverts as well as standards and details. Specific controls follow: 
                  a.  Trenches are to be cut to have vertical faces with a maximum width of two feet or outside diameter of pipe plus 18 inches. They shall be shored where necessary to prevent caving and sloughing. 
                  b.  Bedding shall be provided to a depth of 12 inches or half of the diameter of the pipe, whichever is the least. Bedding shall consist of granular soil free of lumps, clods, cobbles and frozen materials, and shall be graded to a firm-but-yeilding surface without abrupt changes in bearing value. Unstable soils and rock ledges shall be sub-excavated from the bedding zone and replaced by imported material. For carriers laid without encasement, the bedding shall be shaped to fit the bottom of the pipe for 60 percent of its width. See the GDOT standard specifications for additional information on backfill material. 
                  c.  Backfilling of trenches must be accomplished immediately after the pipeline or other utility is placed therein or as directed by the director. Backfill shall be placed in two stages: first, sidefill to the level of the top of pipe; second, overfill to former surface grade. Sidefill shall consist of granular material laid in six-inch layers, each consolidated by mechanical tamping and controlled addition of moisture, to a density of 95 percent as determined by AASHTO method T-99 or GHD. 
                  Overfill shall be layered and consolidated to match the compaction. The top 12 inches shall be compacted to 100 percent of specified density. Consolidation by saturation or ponding will not be permitted. Use 57 stone material or another GDOT type II material that is approved by the director in wet trenches, these materials shall be compacted like above stated backfill to a satisfactory uniform density as directed by the director. 
                  (9)  Pavement cuts. No open cuts in pavement will be permitted except by special permission of the director when there is an emergency and the public health or safety is imperiled, or for making a service tap on a line under the pavement when no other distribution line is available in the area where the service is required. In no event will an open cut be permitted when it is reasonably practical to bore, tunnel, etc., under the surface of the roadway. Whenever the director is requested to authorize an open cut, such request must be made in writing supported by detailed reasons some other method is not practical and giving details relative to the maintenance history and service life of the facility. The department requires (1) that backfill and repaving be performed under its direction at the expense of the applicant and (2) that the applicant remain liable for cost of repair if the backfill subsides or the patched pavement fails. When approval of the director is granted, the following provisions shall be strictly adhered to. 
                  a.  The trench edges in paved areas shall be sawed or cut to neat lines by methods satisfactory to the director before starting to break the pavement slab. 
                  b.  Materials and methods of shall be adopted to achieve prompt restoration of traffic service. 
                  1.  In trenching across the roadway, only one-half of the paved surface is to be opened at one time. The open half shall be completely backfilled before opening the other half. 
                  2.  Closure of intersecting streets, road approaches, or other access points for trenching operations will not be permitted. Upon trenching across such facilities, the applicant shall utilize steel running plates, planks or other satisfactory methods for traffic entering or leaving the highway or adjacent properties. Immediately after the facility authorized by the permit has been placed, the intersecting streets, road approaches or other access facilities, shall be restored to at least as good condition as it was prior to the permit operations and in a manner satisfactory to the director. Spot resurfacing, (milling, grinding and/or additional asphalt) may be required. 
                  Once the pavement is cut, it is most difficult to reconstruct to obtain the structural strength and surface quality the road and pavement had prior to cutting. For trenches over four feet wide, the subbase, base and paving shall be replaced in kind using construction procedures in accordance with the current GDOT standard specifications. For trenches up to four feet wide, the subbase, base and paving shall be replaced in kind using construction procedures in accordance with GDOT standard number 1401; except class A GDOT concrete will be used in place of class B or soil cement base and 9.5mm or 12.5mm superpave asphalt will be used or as determined by the director. Utility cuts in Portland cement concrete pavement are discouraged by the department. Pavement cuts, when allowed will require complete or partial slab replacement. The director will determine the extent of slab replacement on a case by case basis if an open cut is allowed. Procedures for slab removal and replacement will use construction procedures in accordance with the current GDOT standard specifications and standard number 1401, also including but not limited to surface tolerance requirements set forth in the current GDOT standard specifications.

                  Sec. 113-163. - Retaining walls. 
                  (1)  General requirements. 
                  a.  When permanent grades are proposed to be steeper than 2:1 (one vertical foot of rise for every two feet of horizontal displacement) an appropriate retaining structure shall be designed to reinforce or retain the resulting embankment. 
                  b.  An engineered design may be substituted for the reinforced concrete design if approved by the director. All structural components of the wall shall meet the minimum building codes for the proposed use, including provisions for safety railings and fences.. 
                  c.  All wall designs must demonstrate complete dimensions for line and grade. Wall design will consider surface and foundation drainage and select backfill material for the proposed conditions. 
                  (2)  Permits required. Where retaining walls are to be installed permits shall be obtained in accordance with article VI of these regulations. 
                  (3)  Indemnification/certification. For all retaining walls over four feet in height, the owner of the property containing the proposed wall shall complete an owner's indemnification agreement. For all retaining walls over six feet in height, a professional engineer shall design and certify the wall and complete an engineer's certification agreement for each wall permitted. 
                  The following criteria (contained on indemnification/certification agreements) pertain to all walls unless specifically allowed under variance or modification and permission from the appropriate governing authority: 
                  a.  Retaining walls must be located three feet outside the public right-of-way; 
                  b.  Placement of retaining walls shall comply with any and all applicable easement restrictions; 
                  c.  Retaining walls are to be located within the confines of owner's/applicant's property; and 
                  d.  Retaining walls shall not be located within undisturbed stream buffers and impervious surface setbacks, floodplains, drainage easements or drainage ways in a manner that impedes the flow of water. 
                  (4)  Retaining wall height and materials. 
                  a.  All retaining wall structures in excess of six feet shall be designed by a qualified registered professional engineer and shall be constructed of reinforced concrete, reinforced earth, gabions, or other masonry materials as required by the registered professional engineer. 
                  b.  When the necessity for an earth retaining structure is required for a vertical displacement of six feet or less, appropriate landscaping timbers, or approved equal, may be employed if no permanent structure is supported by the soil retained by the retaining wall. The use of railroad cross ties or other timber product will only be allowed in these instances when the wall is constructed as per detail. 
                  (5)  Handrails. All retaining walls, including stepped or combination wall systems, other than for a stormwater facility, over six feet must have a hand rail or other suitable barrier installed. See section 13.3.8 for requirements for handrails within the stormwater facilities. 
                  (6)  Stepped walls. Embankments in excess of six feet in height that utilize stepped retaining walls shall have the upper wall setback a minimum distance of one times the height of the lower wall or as directed by the registered professional engineer. Grades between the stepped walls shall not exceed 2:1 or as directed by the professional engineer. All stepped walls need to be signed and certified by a registered professional engineer. 
                  (7)  Encroachments. Walls shall be located in such a fashion as to not encroach upon existing or proposed drainage easements, drainage courses, buffers or floodplains or to encumber the natural flow of surface runoff of stormwater. Walls shall be located at a distance from such watercourses to allow for anticipated future maintenance of the easement to prevent a safety hazard to the maintenance workers or to jeopardize the structural integrity of the wall. 
                  (8)  Walls for stormwater facilities (retaining wall permit required). Retaining walls that are proposed for the purpose of a stormwater detention must be designed to demonstrate that the walls are capable of a hydrostatic load as measured from the top of the foundation footing to the highest elevation along the top of the wall. The hydrological design must allow for a free board dimension of one foot and an emergency overflow capacity equal to the allowable peak discharge for the 100-year storm event. The routing calculations should not take into account the existence of the emergency overflow. Place the overflow device above the projected 100-year flood elevation within the detention area. 
                  Where the walls are located within a fenced stormwater facility no handrails shall be required along the top of the wall. 
                  Where no fencing of the facility has been required and the wall exceeds four feet in height (as measured from top of wall to normal water level or pond bottom for dry facilities), a handrail or other suitable barrier, approved by the director, shall be provided along the top of the wall. The director may require handrails, or other suitable barriers, for wall heights of less than four feet where, in the opinion of the director, conditions exist that pose a safety hazard.

                  (Ord. No. 2009-06-18, (13.5), 6-29-2009) 
                  Sec. 113-166. - Stormwater management. 
                  (1)  Design criteria—General. 
                  a.  All design related to the stormwater facilities shall be in accordance with the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual as adopted or amended. 
                  b.  Installation of properly functioning stormwater facilities, including outflow control devices shall be the responsibility of the owner. If any facilities are damaged or destroyed during grading or construction activities, all processes shall cease until such devices are restored to their functional capacity. The owner, through application for a land disturbance permit, agrees to accept this responsibility. 
                  (2)  Stormwater management report required. A stormwater management report shall be provided for every project as required by the city's stormwater management ordinance. The purpose of this report shall be to formulate a plan to manage stormwater runoff so that stormwater runoff hazards are not created and existing run-off related problems are not exacerbated, either upstream or downstream from or within the boundaries of the property being developed. The engineer shall be responsible for obtaining all information necessary for the report. Hydrologic analysis and detention pond hydraulics, pipe and open channel hydraulics, culvert hydraulics and water quality best management practices shall be certified by a professional engineer registered in the State of Georgia. 
                  (3)  Stormwater detention. 
                  a.  Whenever a stormwater management report indicates that an adverse impact from stormwater runoff is expected to result from the development of a property, that project shall be provided with stormwater detention facilities. The meaning of adverse impact shall apply to situations where the post developed discharge velocities and/or flows, up to and including the 100-year storm event, 24-hour storm event, exceed those determined for the pre-developed conditions or where the downstream conditions indicated that the design flow exceeds the conveyance capacity of the receiving facility or potentially creates flooding conditions in downstream structures. 
                  b.  Stormwater detention facilities shall be designed in accordance with these regulations and the city stormwater management ordinance so that their peak release rates, when combined with those of all detention bypass areas in the same basin, produce peak flow rates and flow velocities at the site's boundary line are no greater than those which occurred at the same location under pre-developed conditions. 
                  c.  Peak flow rate and velocity control shall normally be provided as required by the city's stormwater management ordinance. however, under certain conditions, the 100-year event must also be detained to the pre-developed rate. Such control of the 100-year event shall be provided when failure to do so would result in flooding of other habitable dwellings, property damage, or public access and/or utility interruption. 
                  d.  Stormwater detention facilities shall be provided, unless the registered professional engineer provides certified documentation supporting the conclusion that at least one of the following is true and correct: 
                  1.  The undetained flow will pass through downstream properties, in drainage easements obtained by the developer, to an existing detention facility which has been designed to manage the upstream property's runoff or to the point in the downstream analysis which shows that detention is not required; or, 
                  2.  Where the site runoff will flow directly into a stream or lake without crossing off-site properties and the following conditions are met: 
                  i.  Conveyance systems on the project site are adequately designed or sufficient in their existing conditions to transport the undetained flows without further degredation; and 
                  ii.  The downstream analysis, using timing of the hydrographs, shows no adverse impacts from the exit of the site to the point in the drainage basin where the project area is ten percent of the total drainage basin area. 
                  e.  Should the authorized registered professional conclude that stormwater detention may not be necessary, rigid compliance with all of the following criteria is mandatory: 
                  1.  A stormwater management report shall always be required whether or not stormwater detention is required. 
                  2.  If the applicant proposes to show that the detention requirement may be eliminated for all or a portion of a project, then a pre-submittal conference with the department staff is required prior to preparation and submittal of construction plans for the project. 
                  3.  At the pre-submittal conference with the staff, the consultant shall be prepared to discuss the downstream analysis findings as follows: 
                  i.  The affected stream must be analyzed downstream from the project to a point where the project area is ten percent of the total drainage basin. The analysis must include all culverts, obstructions, existing and potential erosion problems, elevations of existing improvements/strucutres, and any other existing modifications to natural conditions; 
                  ii.  If the existing downstream conditions are overburdened by the pre-developed flows in the stream, then detention shall be required unless the developer elects to eliminate the downstream overburdened conditions at his or her expense when the development occurs; and 
                  iii.  If there are any existing drainage complaints downstream, then detention shall be required unless the developer elects to minimize the conditions causing the complaint at his or her expense when the development occurs. 
                  f.  Where it is determined by the analysis required by this section that stormwater detention is not required it should not be interpreted as a waiver of channel protection and water quality requirements. 
                  g.  All stormwater detention/retention structures (both above and below ground) shall be located outside of building setbacks and zoning buffers. 
                  (4)  Extended detention. Extended detention shall normally be provided in accordance with the requirements of the city stormwater ordinance. 
                  (5)  Water quality. Water quality measures shall be installed in accordance with the city post-development stormwater management ordinance. 
                  (6)  Off-site upstream conditions. 
                  a.  Culvert, pipe system and open channel design. All culverts, pipe systems and open channel flow systems shall be sized based on all on-site upstream areas being developed in accordance with the development plans and the off-site upstream areas being fully developed in accordance with the land use plan with no detention. Upstream detention may be included when determining flows, provided the engineer calculates the reduced flow by routing the developed flows through any stormwater facility included in the analysis rather than assuming that a reduction will occur. The engineer shall show that the detention facilities used in the analysis will remain, be properly maintained and that the storage volume and outlet structure configuration used in the routing analysis is based on current conditions. 
                  b.  Detention facility design. When determining the offsite flow rates contributing to a stormwater detention facility the flows from off-site areas shall be based on the existing conditions, including all existing lakes, ponds and detention facilities. 
                  (7)  Existing conditions (pre-development). Existing or pre-development conditions shall be defined as the conditions of the site at the time the development permit is applied for. The existing condition used to establish pre-development flow rates and velocities shall include all on-site lakes, ponds, or detention facilities. Pre-developed flows shall be determined by routing the flows through these stormwater facilities. 
                  If it is determined by the director that the existing conditions downstream of the project site warrant further protection the director may require the existing conditions analysis to assume that the site is in its natural, undisturbed state. 
                  (8)  Hydrology report requirements. The stormwater management report shall comply with the city's stormwater management ordinance. In addition to the submittal requirements required by the stormwater ordinance the report shall include the following information when applicable: 
                  a.  Cover sheet signed and sealed in accordance with the stormwater management ordinance.

                  e.  Basin delineation maps (pre- and post-, tc flow paths, sub-basin CN). 
                  f.  Hydrograph input and output. 
                  g.  Routing input and output. 
                  h.  Stage-storage/ outflow relationships. 
                  i.  Outlet control details. 
                  j.  Water quality, channel protection, overbank flood protection, and extreme flood protection volumes. 
                  k.  Water quality spreadsheet. 
                  l.  Ten percent downstream analysis. 
                  m.  Channel/ditch calculations. 
                  n.  Pipe chart (shown on plans also). 
                  o.  Gutter spread calculations. 
                  p.  Downstream sediment analysis. 
                  (9)  Side slope and fencing requirements. All stormwater facilities shall be constructed with minimum 4:1 side slopes or fenced when the facility contains a permanent pool deeper than 18 inches or the 25-year maximum flood depth exceeds 18 inches (use a 24-hour duration for facilities designed using SCS methodology). The fence shall be a minimum of six feet high and made of a durable material with a ten-foot wide access gate. The fence shall comply with all applicable zoning requirements. 
                  (10)  Temporary facilities. Stormwater detention facilities shall be constructed in accordance with the approved plans and shall be in place and inspected prior to the initiation of other improvements. If the detention facility is planned to be a lake, micro pool or constructed wetland, temporary detention facilities shall be provided and shall remain in place until the feature has become a functional stormwater management facility. 
                  (11)  Redevelopment and the use of existing stormwater facilities. 
                  a.  When a development uses an existing facility where the last approved certification and record drawing of the facility was over 18 months prior to the new development's submittal, the engineer shall provide one of the following. 
                  1.  A new survey, drawing and certification showing that the outlet structure is constructed as approved and the flood storage and water quality volume of the facility is equal to or greater than the volume required when the facility was approved; 
                  2.  Construction plans and calculations showing that the outlet structure will function as designed and the flood storage and water quality volume of the facility will be equal to or greater than the volume required when the facility was approved once the proposed maintenance has been performed; or 
                  3.  A new record survey, drawing, study and certification showing that the facility meets the development requirements when the facility was approved. 
                  b.  When the development is part of a redevelopment strategy or the proposed development intends to use a master facility that does not meet current stormwater standards as established in the stormwater management ordinance, the following shall apply: 
                  1.  When impervious surface is created, added, or replaced, or land disturbance exceed the allowable thresholds established in the stormwater ordinance, and the disturbed area is more than 50 percent of the property, the water quality and quantity requirements of this section must be met for the entire site. 
                  2.  When either the impervious surface or land disturbance thresholds are not exceeded, the project is exempt from having to provide the water quality and quantity requirements of this section for the project or for the rest of the site. 
                  3.  When impervious surface is created, added, or replaced, or land disturbance exceed the allowable thresholds established in the stormwater ordinance, and the disturbed area is less than 50 percent of the property, the project shall provide water quality and quantity treatment for just the improvements on the site. 
                  4.  Where water quality treatment for a proposed development is to be provided in an existing detention basin then treatment must be provided for the entire original project basin. A modification to the 25-year detention requirement may be granted for the purpose of retrofitting the detention pond to meet current water quality regulations provided it can be shown that the modification will not have adverse impacts downstream of the project site. Granting of a modification will meet the intent and purpose of these regulations when: 
                  i.  The detention requirements of the current regulations are provided in the facility for the one-year, two-year, five-year and ten-year storm. For a retrofitted basin, the volume of the one-year storm shall be based on the original project area being detained instead of the total area draining to the basin; 
                  ii.  The water quality requirements of the current regulations are provided for the original project area in the facility; 
                  iii.  The ponding limits create a hardship if no modification is granted; and, the outlet structure meets the requirements of the current regulations. 
                  (12)  Evidence of acquisition of applicable non-local permits. The applicant may be required to provide documentation that all other applicable environmental permits have been acquired for the site prior to approval of the stormwater management report. 
                  (13)  Stormwater facility location criteria. 
                  a.  For purposes of these regulations, a stormwater facility shall be deemed to consist of the area within the maximum design ponding limits, the dam (if one) including all embankment slopes and wall footings (if applicable), primary and emergency outlet works, any drainage and access easements, and any forebay or energy dissipation devices. 
                  The intent of these regulations is to ensure that the extent of the facility is defined to allow flooding, access and maintenance. Granting of a modification will not nullify these regulations when the facility is a wet pond or lake, the area within the maximum design ponding limits is reduced to a few feet inside the normal pool elevation, and easements are provided on the perimeter properties to allow for flooding, access and maintenance around the lake. In addition, granting of the modification shall only be considered when the wet pond is an amenity and under no circumstances shall the dam and outlet structure lie on private property that is not in some form of common ownership. 
                  b.  Detention facilities, to the greatest extent feasible, shall be located so as to minimize the amount of flow generated on the project site that by-passes the facility. 
                  c.  No portion of any stormwater facility shall disturb any required buffer, landscape strip, or tree protection area. 
                  d.  The 100-year ponding limits of a stormwater facility shall not encroach upon a public right-of-way. 
                  e.  Stormwater facilities may be located within or encroach upon utility easements or utility rights-of-way upon receipt by the department of written permission from both the property and utility owners. 
                  f.  Stormwater facilities may be constructed within recreation areas if the following criteria are met: 
                  1.  Ownership of the area will be held by a qualified property owner's association, homeowners association, or other private parties. 
                  2.  Permanent structures, such as buildings and swimming pools, will not be constructed within the boundaries of the stormwater facility. 
                  3.  Stormwater facilities within active recreation areas will be approved only if the design of the area includes recreation amenities such as ball fields, tennis courts, grassed open areas or other similar improvements. The intent is to provide recreation facilities with detention as a secondary feature. 
                  4.  Permanent stormwater features shall not interfere with the intended used of the recreation amenity, (i.e., a ditch or large swale shall not traverse a ball field, an inlet structure shall not be in a tennis court, etc.). 
                  g.  A residential subdivision of more than three lots that is required by these regulations or the stormwater management ordinance to provide stormwater management facilities shall locate those facilities on an individual lot of record within the development. Lots created within a development project to accommodate detention and retention facilities which are incidental, related, appropriate, and clearly subordinate to the main use in the project are exempt from the minimum lot size requirements in all zoning districts. No other construction/building is permitted on this lot and the lot shall be owned by the homeowners association or the owners of the lots of record being served by this facility. The lot shall have a minimum of 20 feet of public or private road frontage. Access to the facility shall be located on this lot and shall be provided in a manner which allows for access and maintenance of the facility. If the project is provided with an off-site detention facility, a mandatory property owners' association shall be established for its maintenance. The association bylaws shall be recorded concurrently with the recording of a final subdivision plat. 
                  h.  A nonresidential subdivision is not required to locate an on-site stormwater facility on a separate lot. The property owners served by a stormwater facility that provides detention and/or water quality for more than one property owner or is located off-site shall enter into a maintenance agreement acceptable to the city for the facility's maintenance. However, if desired by the developer, the facility may be located on a separate lot if it is owned and maintained by a mandatory property owners' association. 
                  (14)  Stormwater facility access requirements. 
                  a.  In both residential and non-residential projects, an easement at least 20 feet in width shall be required so as to provide access to all detention facilities from a public or private street. The access easement shall conform to the following requirements: 
                  1.  The access easement shall be cleared, grubbed and graded so that it can be utilized by rubber-tired construction vehicles. 
                  2.  The minimum drive surface width shall be 15 feet. 
                  3.  The drive shall be grassed or paved. 
                  4.  The maximum slope shall be 30 percent. 
                  5.  Access easements may be combined with drainage easements containing an open channel; however, the combined easement shall be a minimum of 30 feet in width and shall be wide enough for the drainage channel and the drive. 
                  6.  A drive to the bottom of the pond shall be provided when the facility is over ten feet deep from the bench elevation or the facility is wider than 50 feet as measured from bench to bench. 
                  7.  Where the facility is completely enclosed by walls, an access ramp, ladder or stairs shall be provided into the facility to allow for inspection and maintenance activities. 
                  b.  Every normally-dry stormwater basin, lake, or parking lot detention facility shall be completely enclosed within a drainage/access easement. The drainage/access easement shall extend at least ten feet beyond the 100-year flooding limits of the stormwater facility and shall encompass any dam, outlet structure and energy dissipation devices. A 20-foot wide landscape strip planted to buffer standards shall be provided around the exterior of the detention area outside of the access easement or as may be approved by the city arborist. 
                  (15)  Stormwater facility maintenance. 
                  a.  The storage capacity or function of any stormwater basin, pond or other impoundment, whether natural or manmade, shall not be removed or diminished without the express approval of the department. 
                  b.  In a residential subdivision, it shall be the responsibility of the mandatory property owner's association to maintain the operational characteristics of any facility constructed on their property for stormwater management pursuant to city requirements, to keep the access drive free of obstructions, and to maintain the facility free of obstruction, silt or debris. Where no property owners association exists or where the association has disbanded it shall be the responsibility of all lots within the subdivision that drain to the stormwater facility to provide ongoing inspection and maintenance pursuant to these and other applicable city regulations. 
                  c.  In a nonresidential project with an on-site stormwater facility which serves only that project, the property owner shall be responsible to maintain the operational characteristics of the facility pursuant to city requirements, to keep the access drive free of obstructions, and to maintain the facility free of obstruction, silt or debris. 
                  d.  Where no maintenance covenant has been recorded, it shall be the responsibility of the property owner to maintain the operational characteristics of any facility constructed on their property for stormwater management pursuant to city requirements, to keep the access drive free of obstructions, and to maintain the facility free of obstruction, silt or debris. 
                  e.  Prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy or final plat approval (as appropriate to the project). the owner shall submit a detailed schedule of long-term maintenance and inspection activities. This schedule of activities shall be incorporated into a maintenance covenant signed by the property owner. The schedule shall describe all maintenance and inspection activities and the parties responsible. The maintenance covenant shall be in a form acceptable to the city and shall be recorded in the deed records of the clerk of superior court. 
                  (16)  Stormwater facility certification and as-built drawings. When a new facility is constructed in a development, a certified as-built drawing of each stormwater facility shall be prepared by a land surveyor currently registered in the State of Georgia. 
                  Based on the actual parameters established on the as-built drawing, an addendum to the stormwater management report shall be prepared which demonstrates that the facility, as constructed, complies with the requirements of these regulations. The amended or as-built stormwater management report shall be certified by the authorized registered professional. Any deviations from the original design shall be clearly noted as well as any impact, if any, these deficiencies may have on the operational characteristics of the facility 
                  The survey shall be performed after substantial completion and stabilization of the project has occurred. The as-built drawing and addendum to the stormwater management report shall be submitted to the city at least one week prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy or final plat approval (as appropriate to the project). 
                  The as-built drawing shall show the following information. Where elevations or dimensions are shown on the as-built, the original design data should be shown and struck-through with the actual as-built data indicated next to that: 
                  a.  Horizontal and vertical alignment. 
                  b.  Locations of all manholes, catch basins and junction boxes. 
                  c.  Detention, retention, water quality facilities. 
                  d.  Outlet structure details. 
                  e.  Stormwater facility storage volumes. 
                  f.  Storm system outfalls. 
                  g.  Creeks and drainage swales or ditches. 
                  h.  Piping materials. 
                  i.  Invert elevations and pipe profiles. 
                  j.  Location and extent of easements. 
                  k.  Property lines. 
                  This information shall be provided in the form of plans, profiles, details, sections and plats and when possible provided to the city in an electronic format compatible with the city database. 
                  (17)  Parking lot detention facilities. 
                  a.  Parking lot detention facilities shall generally be of one of the two following types: 
                  1.  Depressed areas of pavement at drop inlet locations; 
                  2.  Ponding areas along sections of raised curbing. The curbing in these areas is usually higher than a standard curbed section. 
                  b.  Parking lot detention areas shall be located so as to restrict ponding to areas other than parking spaces near buildings, and to not encroach upon entrance drives. 
                  c.  The maximum depth of detention ponding in a parking lot, except at a flow control structure, shall be six inches for a ten-year storm, and nine inches for a 100-year storm. The maximum depth of ponding at a flow control structure shall be 12 inches for a 100-year storm. 
                  d.  In truck parking areas, the maximum depth of ponding shall be 12 inches for the ten-year storm. 
                  e.  Detention ponding areas are to be drained within 30 minutes after the peak inflow occurs. 
                  f.  Parking lot detention areas shall have a minimum surface slope of one percent, and a maximum slope of five percent. 
                  (18)  Underground and rooftop detention facilities. The design of underground or rooftop detention facilities shall be in accordance with current engineering standard practice, and shall conform to the requirements of this article. In the case of rooftop detention, permissible structural loads and weatherproofing shall be governed by the Georgia State Building Code as may be amended by the city. 
                  (19)  Sediment basins. 
                  a.  Stormwater management and sediment trapping functions should be separated whenever possible. Every erosion control design should seek to: first, prevent erosion from occurring; second, trap sediments as close to their sources as possible, and: third, provide a second-tier or backup line of defense against sediments leaving the project site. This backup defense will usually consist of check dams/and or sediment basins. 
                  b.  Whenever a sediment basin and a detention facility are both required on the same watercourse, the sediment basin should be located immediately upstream of the detention facility. 
                  c.  In cases where a normally-dry detention basin is planned to be used to trap sediment as well as provide stormwater control, under cutting of the basin will not be permitted. 
                  d.  The design of sediment basins shall be in accordance with appendix C of the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia." 
                  e.  Trapping of sediment in state waters shall not be allowed. 
                  (20)  Ponds and lakes not used for detention. In such cases where a pond or lake is provided as part of a development, but is not planned to function as a stormwater detention facility, the same general and specific criteria contained in these regulations shall apply, but may be modified in instances where a specific requirement is clearly detention oriented rather than safety-based.

Upon any modification to the dam it shall become subject to these regulations. 
                  Dams that are located on a project site for which a development permit is being requested shall be brought up to the minimum design standards contained in these regulations regardless of whether any modifications are proposed to the dam or appurtenant structures. If the dam and structures are not wholly contained within the project boundaries the director may waive any or all of these requirements when satisfied that all reasonable efforts have been unsuccessful to obtain the approval from adjacent land owners for any work necessary to comply with these regulations. 
                  (3)  Emergency draining of a lake. Upon obtaining, evidence which indicates that a potentially hazardous condition may exist (regardless of dam height), such as, but not limited to: 
                  a.  Excessive leakage transporting soil from the dam interior (i.e. piping). 
                  b.  Slope failure, excessive scouring or other apparent soil instability.

                  4.  A pre-design meeting shall be held with representatives of the engineering division to review any proposed dam or proposed dam changes for any dam over ten vertical feet or impounding more than 50 acre-feet. Depending on the level of downstream risk, and size of impoundment, the city may require a dam breach analysis to be submitted for any proposed or existing dam contained within a proposed development, utilizing the National Weather Service's DAMBREAK program or other methodology approved by the Georgia Safe Dams Program. 
                  5.  When a dam breach analysis is required by the city, a sunny day dam breach analysis shall be performed under full pool conditions as a minimum. 
                  6.  All impoundments shall have a permanent drain capable of draining the pool to a depth of no more than two feet within 24 hours. 
                  7.  No roadways shall be constructed over any permanent water impoundment structure if that roadway provides the only means of egress for any lot of record, without prior approval of the city. 
                  8.  No utilities are permitted to pass through any dam, either longitudinally or transversely, without prior approval of the city.

                  11.  Designated contractor (if available) 
                  c.  Outlet/spillway requirements. Because of the variables associated with selecting spillway(s), outlet device(s) or appurtenant structure(s) to suit a given site condition, the design consultant is responsible for the selection, subject to the review and approval of the department. The division will include in its consideration the case of maintenance, longevity of the system, blockage potential, and practicality of operations. 
                  1.  No orifice shall be less than three inches in diameter unless it is installed to meet a state or local requirement. 
                  2.  All risers (standpipes) shall be equipped with a debris deflector (trash rack) and an anti-vortex device. To facilitate outlet operation, curved or inclined a-ash racks designed to allow debris to rise with the water level are preferred. In all cases, trash racks shall be either hinged or removable to facilitate maintenance operations. corrugated metal pipe is not permitted for standpipes. 
                  3.  Spillways: Every dam shall be provided with a principal spillway, fully capable of passing at least the 50-year flood, with excess spillway capacity provided by the emergency spillway(s) capable of handling excess flows up to the design storm. The principal spillway can be sized for floods of less magnitude than the 50-year flood only if the emergency spillway is appropriately armored against scour with concrete or other suitable lining as protection against more frequent usage. 
                  4.  Principal spillway: All spillways shall be analyzed (hydraulically rated) for both inlet and outlet control conditions using appropriate tail-water ratings. If a control-box or weir-box is affixed, then the coral system (inlet control box and outlet conduit) shall be hydraulically rated to determine the stage-discharge relationship. 
                  5.  Emergency spillway(s): For every type of water impounding facility a planned safe flow path must be provided for conveyance of flows of water in an emergency. In many instances, this function can be provided through installation of an emergency spillway. Emergency spillways may be excavated open channels, either vegetated or paved with reinforced concrete or weir sections of concrete walls, or, appropriately designed conduit. Any portion of an open channel spillway excavated into a dam embankment or other fill section must be paved with reinforced concrete equipped with appropriate seepage controls, under-drainage and cut-off walls. 
                  6.  Any portion of any spillway excavated into undisturbed residual soil shall be vegetated in accordance with the practices described in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" or protected against scour and erosion by other suitable measures if vegetation does not provide adequate stabilization. The spillway is activated by storms smaller than the 50-year frequency, and then vegetation alone will not be considered sufficient protection against scour according to these standards. 
                  d.  Permanent impoundments. The following requirements shall apply to lakes and ponds that maintain a permanent pool of water: 
                  1.  Earthen dam.

                  2.  Earthen dam. 
                  i.  Front slope shall not be steeper than 2.5:1 unless design includes a slope stability analysis that confirms and documents a steeper slope will be stable. In no condition, however, can any slope be steeper than 2: 1. 
                  ii.  All organics and topsoil shall be removed from the entire footprint of the dam and the foundation inspected and approved by the city prior to fill placement. 
                  iii.  Earthen fill shall be CL or ML material approved for use by geotechnical engineer (PE) and placed and compacted to not less than 95 percent standard proctor under said engineer's direction. 
                  iv.  Freeboard of dam above the 100-year design storm maximum pool shall be two feet in lieu of fetch calculations of wave height justifying a lesser freeboard. The city reserves the right to require additional freeboard above the nominal two-feet requirement if supported by fetch calculations.

                  Sec. 4.3. - Exceptions. 
                  This Ordinance shall apply to every lot, parcel, property, use and structure in the City of Johns Creek except as excluded in this section. Furthermore, the provisions herein shall not apply to properties and structures owned, operated and/or leased for use by the City of Johns Creek for public purposes. The use of said property for a nonconforming use does not establish a precedent for other non-public (governmental) uses. Should the public use cease to exist, the provisions herein shall apply. 
                  4.3.1.  Nonconforming Lots, Uses and Structures. Within the zoning districts established by this ordinance there may exist lots, structures, and uses of both land and structures which were lawful before this ordinance was adopted or subsequently amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this ordinance as adopted or subsequently amended. Nonconforming lots, uses and structures may continue in their nonconforming status with the following limitations and/or requirements. 
                  A.  Nonconforming Lot. A single, lawful lot-of-record which does not meet the requirements of this ordinance for area or dimensions, or both, may be used for the buildings and accessory buildings necessary to carry out permitted uses subject to the following provisions: 
                  1.  Parking space requirements as provided for in Article XVIII are met; and 
                  2.  Such lot does not adjoin another vacant lot(s) or portion of a lot in the same ownership. 
                  3.  If two (2) or more adjoining lots or portions of lots in single ownership do not meet the requirements established for lot width, frontage or area, the property involved shall be treated as one lot, and no portion of said lot shall be used or sold in a manner which diminishes compliance with this ordinance. This paragraph shall not apply to non- conforming lots when fifty percent or more of adjoining lots on the same street are the same size or smaller. 
                  B.  Nonconforming Uses of Land. When a use of land is nonconforming pursuant to the provisions of this ordinance, such use may continue as long as it remains otherwise lawful and complies with the following provisions: 
                  1.  No nonconforming use shall be enlarged, increased or extended to occupy a greater area of land than that which was occupied at the time use became nonconforming; 
                  2.  No nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any other portion of the lot not occupied by such use at the time the use became nonconforming; and 
                  3.  If any nonconforming use of land ceases for a period of more than one year, any subsequent use of such land shall comply with this ordinance. 
                  C.  Nonconforming Use of Structures. If a lawful use of structure, or of a structure and lot in combination, exists at the effective date of adoption of this ordinance or its subsequent amendment that would not be allowed under provisions of this ordinance as adopted or amended, the use may be continued so long as it complies with other regulations, subject to the following conditions: 
                  1.  No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this ordinance shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered except in changing the use of the structure to a permitted use; 
                  2.  Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any part of a building which was arranged or designed for such use at the time the use became nonconforming, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building; 
                  3.  If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a structure or structure and land may be changed to another nonconforming use of the same or more restrictive nature; 
                  4.  When a nonconforming use of a structure or a structure and land in combination is replaced with a conforming use, such structure or land may not later revert to a nonconforming use; 
                  5.  When a nonconforming use of a structure or structure and land in combination is discontinued or abandoned for one year, the structure or structure and land in combination shall not thereafter be used except in conformance with the regulations of the district in which it is located; and 
                  6.  A nonconforming use of a structure and/or a nonconforming use of land shall not be extended or enlarged by attachment to a building or land of additional signs which can be seen from off the land or by the addition of other uses of a nature which would be prohibited generally in the district. 
                  D.  Nonconforming Structures. When a structure exists on the effective date of adoption of this ordinance or its amendments that could not be built under the terms of this ordinance because of restrictions on building area, lot coverage, height, yards, or other characteristics of the structure or its location on the lot, such structure may remain as long as it complies with all other zoning regulations, subject to the following conditions: 
                  1.  No structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its nonconformity; 
                  2.  Destruction, by any means, of more than sixty percent of the gross square footage of a structure shall require that the structure be reconstructed in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance; 
                  3.  Any structure which is moved, for any reason and for any distance whatever, shall conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located; 
                  4.  Telecommunications Facilities. 
                  a.  All telecommunication facilities existing on the effective date of this ordinance shall be allowed to continue to be used as they presently exist. 
                  b.  Routine maintenance (including modifications to accommodate the co-location of an additional user or users) shall be permitted on existing telecommunication facilities. 
                  c.  Replacement of antennas on a structure with different antennas shall be considered routine maintenance so long as the replacement antenna(s) does not increase the height of any existing structure. 
                  E.  Rezoning Which Results in Nonconforming Structures. When a property containing lawful structures is rezoned, the following shall apply: 
                  1.  The approval of the rezoning by the Mayor and City Council shall automatically adjust minimum/maximum yards to the extent necessary for existing structures to comply. 
                  2.  All new construction, expansions or additions shall comply with the minimum yard requirements of the new district. 
                  3.  Buffers and landscape areas shall be established by conditions of zoning which shall have precedence over the district standards contained in Section 4.23. 
                  4.  Destruction or removal of buildings which preexisted rezoning shall reinstate the development standards of the then applicable district provisions of this Zoning Ordinance. 
                  F.  Exemptions Due to State, County or City Action. Whenever a lot becomes nonconforming as a result of land acquisition by the City, county or state, building permits shall be granted for new construction provided the proposed structure complies with all but lot area requirements, and setback requirements shall be reduced without requirement for a variance to the extent of the width of the acquired property. 
                  Whenever a structure becomes nonconforming as a result of county or state action other than an amendment to this ordinance, the use of the structure may continue and the structure may be replaced as though no nonconformity exists if, subsequent to such action, the structure is destroyed. 
                  4.3.2.  Model Homes. Dwelling units may be utilized for sales offices and/or model homes as long as two or more lots and/or dwelling units in the development have not undergone an initial sale or lease by the builder. 
                  4.3.3.  Height Limits. The zoning districts' maximum height limitations for structures shall not apply to the following:

                  (Ord. No. 2015-12-42, Exh. A, 1-25-2016) 
                  4.3.4.  Minimum building lines. The minimum yards (setbacks) in each district shall establish minimum building lines for all structures except those named in Section 4.2.5 entitled, Uses and Structures Permitted in Yards, and Outside Storage.

A flag lot stem shall not be less than 15 feet in width. 
                  (Ord. No. 2015-12-42, Exh. A, 1-25-2016) 
                  4.3.5.  Encroachment on Public Rights-of-Way. No privately owned structures other than driveways, access walkways, and mail boxes shall be permitted within a public right-of-way.

                  Sec. 4.4. - Large Scale Retail/Service Commercial Structures and Developments 75,000 Square Feet or Greater. 
                  4.4.1.  Purpose and Intent. "Large-scale retail" refers to any individual retail establishment that is 75,000 square feet or greater. This size threshold refers to an individual establishment and its associated areas used for display and storage. 
                  The purpose of establishing requirements for large-scale retail establishments is to apply design standards and additional conditions to large developments proposed in the City of Johns Creek in order to ensure the development of appropriate, functional, well-planned, aesthetically pleasing retail/service commercial developments that stimulate economic and social growth, are integrated with surrounding areas, positively contribute to the changing community character, with facilities that have functional reuse potential in the future. 
                  As such, these regulations intend to promote high quality materials and design, promote pedestrian-friendly environments, encourage infrastructure concurrency, encourage responsible storm-water management practices, and promote environmental planning policies. 
                  The regulations are to be used in conjunction with the development criteria of the City of Johns Creek Zoning Ordinance and all other adopted development standards and criteria, including overlay district standards. 
                  (Ord. No. 2015-12-42, Exh. A, 1-25-2016) 
                  4.4.2.  Number, Size and Location Criteria. Large scale retail establishments or developments cannot be accessed solely via collector or local roads, as defined by the City of Johns Creek guidelines and depicted on the Georgia DOT Road Functional Classification maps. They are solely permitted on sites with at least one frontage on an arterial road. However, the Director may waive the road classification criteria if the developer can demonstrate that the proposed road improvements, with identified funding sources, will accommodate projected traffic volume to be generated by the proposed development to the degree that the current LOS or better is maintained for the affected road segment. 
                  No more than four large scale retail establishments, as defined in this ordinance, are allowed in a single development. Developments may include additional smaller retail structures as part of the overall development; however the number of retail establishments 75,000 square feet or larger is limited to four, and such developments are subject to the regulations outlined in this ordinance. 
                  Developments are encouraged to create a cluster effect in order to achieve a village and/or town center effect. The ordinance promotes an appropriate mix of large and small scale retail with smaller retail buildings located closer to streets in order to reduce the visual scale of the development, encourage pedestrian traffic, and promote the use of architectural details. 
                  The ordinance also recognizes the varied types of developments in the City of Johns Creek and promotes the use of screening and buffers in areas with a more rural aesthetic. 
                  4.4.3.  Site Design Guidelines and Requirements. 
                  A.  General Site Guidelines. 
                  1.  To the extent feasible, on-site creeks should be integrated into the site as amenities. 
                  2.  New construction shall conform to the existing topography as much as possible subject to approval by the Director of the Department of Community Development. 
                  3.  Buildings shall not be built on existing slopes greater than 33%. This condition may be amended as approved by the Director. 
                  4.  Where retaining walls are required, they must be faced with stone, brick or decorative concrete modular block. Use of landscape timber as exterior treatment in retaining walls is prohibited. Retaining walls above 5 feet shall have evergreen plantings in front or as approved by the Director. 
                  5.  Detention facilities are encouraged to be designed pursuant to the Alternative Design Standards described in the the City of Johns Creek 2003 Subdivision Regulations. 
                  6.  To the greatest extent practicable, design of a traditional detention facility shall follow the natural landforms around the perimeter of the basin. 
                  1.  A minimum of ten percent (10%) of the site shall be landscaped open space. 
                  2.  Each retail development shall contribute to the establishment or enhancement of the community and public spaces by providing at least two community amenities such as patio/seating area, water feature, clock tower, and pedestrian plazas or benches. Such features shall be constructed of materials that are the same or similar to those used for the principal buildings and landscape. 
                  3.  Square footage of community areas can be counted towards the minimum open space requirement. 
                  C.  Screening and Fencing. 
                  1.  Landscaping and fencing materials should be used to minimize visual and noise impact of parking, loading areas and accessory site features. 
                  2.  All loading areas shall be located to the rear or side of the building. Location should be restricted, however, to whichever location does not abut a residentially zoned property, if applicable. Loading areas shall be screened from view of any public street by a 5-foot berm, a continuous row of evergreen hedges 5 foot in height at the time of planting, or architectural treatment. 
                  3.  Refuse areas and receptacles shall be placed in the least visible location from public streets and shall be enclosed on 3 sides with opaque walls. The 4th side shall be a self-closing gate with an architectural finish. Opaque walls shall be a minimum of twelve inches higher than the receptacle. Wall materials shall be noncombustible brick, stone, or split-faced concrete masonry. 
                  4.  Accessory site features, as defined in each zoning district of the Zoning Ordinance, shall be placed in the least visible location from public streets, and shall be screened from view of any right-of-way and/or any property zoned, used, or developed for residential uses, including the AG-1 zoning district, by one of the following means: 
                  (1)  Placement behind the building;

                  C.  Timing of Development. The Inclusionary Housing Plan and Inclusionary Housing Agreement shall include a phasing plan, which provides for the timely development of the Inclusionary Units as the Residential Project is built out. The phasing plan shall provide for development of the Inclusionary Units concurrently with the Market Rate Units; provided however, that the phasing plan will be adjusted by the Director of Community Development away from strict concurrency where necessary in order to account for the different financing and funding environments, economies of scale, and infrastructure needs applicable to development of the Market Rate and the Inclusionary Units. Multi-family development shall 
                  D.  Design. Inclusionary units for single-family shall be comparable in infrastructure (including sewer, water and other utilities), construction quality, and exterior design to the market rate units. Inclusionary units may be smaller in aggregate size and have different interior finishes and features than market rate units so long as the interior features are durable, of good quality and consistent with contemporary standards for new housing.

The Developer of a Development Project subject to the Inclusionary Housing provisions may request that the City of Johns Creek provide Inclusionary Incentives as set forth in this Section. The goal of these Inclusionary Incentives is to apply available incentives to qualifying projects in a manner that, to the extent feasible, offsets the cost of providing the Inclusionary Housing Component. The Director of Community Development shall respond to that request at the time and in the manner specified in this Section, and shall make a determination as to a package of Inclusionary Incentives for the Inclusionary Units as provided in this Section. 
                  A.  Fee Waivers or Deferrals. Upon application, the City of Johns Creek shall make available to a Residential Project Developer a program of waiver, reduction or deferral of development fees, Impact Fee Waiver, administrative and financing fees for Inclusionary Units.

                  B.  Modification of Development Standards. Upon application, the City of Johns Creek may modify for Inclusionary Units, to the extent feasible in light of the uses, design, and infrastructure needs of the Development Project, as determined by the Director of Community Development and the Office of Housing Director, development standards, including but not limited to, road widths, curb and gutter, parking, and housing types. 
                  C.  Interior Finish Reductions. Upon application, the City of Johns Creek may, to the maximum extent appropriate in light of project design elements as determined by the Director of Community Development, allow builders to finish out the interior of Inclusionary Units with less expensive finishes and appliances. 
                  D.  Streamlining and Priority Processing. The Director of Community Development shall expedite development Permits for Residential Projects that include an Inclusionary Housing Component.

                  E.  Density Bonus. The City of Johns Creek shall make available to the Residential Project a Density Bonus as provided in this Section. The number of units allowed may be increased by 20 percent provided, however, that the affordability requirements to qualify for a Density Bonus shall be those stated in this Section. 
                  F.  Local Public Funding. The Developer may apply to the Office of Housing for Local Public Funding to assist in the financing and development of the Inclusionary Housing Component. Local Public Funding may serve to facilitate state allocation of tax credits, mortgage revenue bond funds, or state or federal assistance to the Project ("External Subsidy"); provided that the provision of such Local Public Funding requires that Developer diligently pursue such External Subsidy and is not intended to substitute for such External Subsidy. A Developer seeking Local Public Funding shall apply to the Office of Housing Director for such funding pursuant to this Section. The Office of Housing Director shall submit the proposed Local Public Funding assistance package to the Director of Community Development for inclusion in the City of Johns Creek's Inclusionary Incentives for the project. 
                  The Office of Housing Director, as to the feasible elements of Local Public Funding and in making the determination as to inclusion of Local Public Funding in the Inclusionary Incentives, shall consider: 
                  (1)  The number, percentage, and tenure of the Units for Very Low Income or Low Income Households in the Inclusionary Housing Component; 
                  (2)  The financial structure and financing needs of the Inclusionary Housing Component; 
                  (3)  The cost-efficiency of the solution to the Inclusionary Housing Component; 
                  (4)  The Developer's initiatives in applying for grants and other funds external to Local Public Funding; 
                  (5)  The availability of funds given the funding priorities of Office of Housing and other funding agencies at the time, and other development of housing for Very Low or Low Income Households under way, proposed or anticipated; and 
                  (6)  Other factors necessary to the evaluation. 
                  Office of Housing shall adopt and provide to Developers and other interested parties criteria for evaluation of applicants for Local Public Funding. These criteria may be contained in the Guidelines as outlined by the Office of Housing. 
                  4.26.5.  Construction of the Inclusionary Housing Component to Avoid Over Concentration. The following principles shall apply to the development of the Inclusionary Housing Component: 
                  A.  The Inclusionary Housing Plan shall provide for the dispersal of buildings containing Inclusionary Units to the maximum extent feasible taking into account the funding and financing environments applicable to Inclusionary housing development. 
                  B.  Multi-family buildings may contain any proportion of inclusionary units, but no Inclusionary Housing Development may be located adjacent to another Inclusionary Housing Development. For purposes of this Section, Inclusionary Housing Development means a development containing a building with more than eight (8) units for multi-family or for all residential developments of 20 units or more, in which 10 percent of the total units must be inclusionary units restricted for occupancy by very low, low, or moderate income households except as otherwise provided for herein. The Director of Community Development may allow for variation from these principles, but only the extent necessary, if he or she determines that an alternative configuration of Inclusionary Units is required by funding or financing considerations associated with the development of the Inclusionary Units or by the applicable residential land use designations within and adjacent to the Residential Project. 
                  C.  Proposed Inclusionary Single-family Housing Developments that are located within a census track(s) in which 95% of the existing units are below 80% AMI, must submit a Housing Development Plan that includes the following mixed housing price points for sale: 
                  i.  20% not to exceed $150,000 
                  ii.  60% between $150,000 and $216,000 
                  iii.  20% Market 
                  4.26.6.  Alternatives to the Standard Inclusionary Housing Component. Subject to the approval of the Mayor and City Councilin lieu of constructing affordable housing units on site, a developer may dedicate land or pay in-lieu housing fees. At the time of concept plan review, the developer shall be required to provide a report to the Community Development Director identifying the reasons the construction of the required number of affordable housing units within the development is not feasible. The report shall include sufficient independent data, including appropriate financial information, which supports the developer's claim that it is not feasible to construct the required affordable units and a detailed analysis of why the density bonus cannot mitigate the conditions that prevent the developer from constructing the affordable units. The Director shall review all such requests and prepare a recommendation to the Mayor and City Council. Such requests shall be considered on a case-by-case basis by the Mayor And City Council and may be approved at the Mayor And City Council's sole discretion. The monetary value of an alternative equivalent must be equal to or exceed the cost to produce the required number of affordable housing units on site. 
                  A.  Land Dedication and Off-Site Compliance Options. Upon a determination by the Director of Community Development that the criteria outlined in number 4 below have been met, a Residential Project may provide all or part of its Inclusionary Housing Component by means of the following options: 
                  (1)  Dedication of Land to the City of Johns Creek at No Cost. Under this option, a developer may donate to the County a site on which all or a portion of the mandated inclusionary units can be built. The dedicated site must be located in the same planning area (as defined by the Comprehensive Plan) in unincorporated City of Johns Creek and must be physically suitable for development at the time of conveyance. It must be of sufficient size and properly zoned to accommodate the requisite number of units. It must already have access to water and sewer and public services (police, fire, etc.). The property should not have physical constraints that cause delay or increase construction costs (e.g., grading) or be unsuitable for residential development (e.g., contain toxins). The developer shall provide an appraisal of the land and its appraised value shall be confirmed by the County's Land Division of the General Services Department. 
                  (2)  Development of Inclusionary Units Off-site. Inclusionary units may be constructed outside the Development Project within an Area ("Off-Site") for a Residential Project that is single-family or multifamily. 
                  (3)  A Combination of Options (1) and (2). 
                  (4)  Standard for Approval. The Director of Community Development may approve the proposal only if it provides a more cost-efficient solution to the Inclusionary Housing Component than the standard approach set forth in this Section, or if the location of Off-Site development would be superior to on-site development from the perspective of access to transportation or other applicable residential planning policies in the City of Johns Creek Comprehensive Plan. 
                  (5)  Number of Inclusionary Units Credited to the Dedication or Off-Site Location. The number of Inclusionary Units credited to the dedication or Off-Site location will consist of the number of Inclusionary Units which can with reasonable degree of certainty be developed on the land, given (a) the mix of Inclusionary Unit sizes and type of structure in the Inclusionary Housing Plan; (b) densities permitted by applicable planning and zoning designations; and (c) site, infrastructure, environmental and other physical and planning constraints. 
                  (6)  Site Suitability. The land proposed for dedication or for Off-Site location must be suitable from the perspective of size, configuration, physical characteristics, physical and environmental constraints, access, location, adjacent use, and other relevant planning criteria. The site must allow development of Inclusionary Units in a manner that complies with this Section including the over-concentration provisions set forth in Section 4.26.4. 
                  (7)  Site Identification and Regulatory Status. The Developer must identify the proposed dedicated site or Off-Site location and the number of proposed Units to be credited thereby as part of the Inclusionary Housing Plan required in this Section. At the same time or before the Development Project receives its Inclusionary Incentives, the dedicated or Off-Site land shall have received all the Inclusionary Incentives necessary for development of the Inclusionary Units on such land. Unless the phasing plan requires otherwise, at the same time or before a Residential Project receives its first Project specific Entitlements, the dedicated or Off-Site land shall have received all the necessary Project-Level Approvals necessary for development of the Inclusionary Units on such land, and prior to the issuance of any Certificate of Occupancy for a Residential Project, the dedicated land or Off-Site land shall be fully served with the infrastructure necessary for residential development. 
                  (8)  Director of Community Development Action. The Director of Community Development may recommend conditional approval or denial of the proposed land dedication or Off-Site development proposal. In reviewing the proposal, the Director of Community Development will consult with the Director of the Office of Housing. If the land dedication or the Off-Site proposal is accepted or accepted as modified, the relevant elements of the Inclusionary Housing Plan shall be included in the applicable Legislative Approvals for both the Residential Development generating the requirement for the Inclusionary Housing Component and, if applicable, the dedicated site or Off-Site Development Project where all or part of that requirement is proposed to be met. If the dedication or Off-Site proposal is rejected, the Inclusionary Housing Component shall be provided as set forth in this Section within the Development Project. 
                  (9)  Implementation. As early as possible in the regulatory process, and in no case later than the negotiation of the Inclusionary Housing Agreement as provided in this Section, the Owner of the Residential Project must: (1) In the case of land dedication, provide an irrevocable offer of dedication for the dedicated site at no cost to the City of Johns Creek; and (2) In the case of Off-Site land, demonstrate to the Director of Community Development and the Office of Housing Director that the Off-Site location is and will remain committed to the timely development of the Inclusionary Units as provided in the Inclusionary Housing Plan. This commitment may be demonstrated through ownership of the Off-site location, or through adequate control of the use of the Off-site location through joint ownership, joint venture or other contractual means. If necessary to ensure that Inclusionary Housing Units are developed contemporaneously with the Market Rate Units, the Director of Community Development may require the offer of dedication or evidence of Off-Site control as early as the first Legislative Entitlement. With respect to an Off-site location, the Director of Community Development may also condition development or occupancy of the Residential Project on development or occupancy of the Off-Site Inclusionary Units, and the Inclusionary Housing Agreement must apply to and be recorded against both the Residential Project and the Off-Site land. With respect to dedicated land, the City of Johns Creek, upon acceptance of the offer of dedication, shall publish a request for proposal for development of the site(s), which will result in the production of the number of Inclusionary Units credited to the site(s). 
                  B.  In-Lieu Housing Fees. For Residential Developments of 20 or more units, including Inclusionary Units, the requirements of this Section may be satisfied by paying an in-lieu fee to the Affordable Housing Trust Fund. 
                  (1)  Under this option, the developer may pay an amount equivalent to the cost of constructing the mandated units at the required affordability levels. Fees shall be calculated for the construction of affordable housing units for moderate and low and very low income households and shall be adjusted annually based upon the estimated average construction cost per square foot of floor area for single-family (not including the value of the improved lot) as estimated for the region (south) by the National Association of Home Builders or the American Apartment Association for multi-family development. 
                  (2)  The County Manager shall establish an affordable Housing Trust Fund for the receipt and management of in-lieu housing fees. Monies received into the fund shall be utilized solely for the construction or purchase and maintenance of affordable housing and for the costs of administering programs consistent with the purposes of the section. In all cases, the required number of housing units at the required levels of affordability shall be provided for by this fund. 
                  (3)  Fees must be paid within ten calendar days of issuance of a building permit for the Development or the permit will be null and void. For phased Developments, payments may be made for each portion of the Development within ten calendar days of the issuance of a Building Permit for that phase. When payment is delayed, in the event of default, or for any other reason, the amount of the in-lieu fee payable under this Section will be based upon the fee schedule in effect at the time the fee is paid. 
                  (4)  No final inspection for occupancy will be completed for any corresponding Market-rate Unit in a Residential Development unless fees required under this Section have been paid in full to the Department of Community Development. 
                  C.  Combined Dedication of Land and In-Lieu Housing Fees. Under this option, the developer may dedicate land and pay in-lieu housing fees equivalent to the cost of producing the mandated units at the required affordability levels. The developer shall provide an appraisal of the land and its appraised value shall be confirmed by the County's Land Division of the General Services Department. 
                  4.26.7.  Exclusions. The requirements of this Article do not apply to: 
                  A.  Housing developments of fewer than 20 lots; 
                  B.  Structures that have been destroyed by fire, flood, earthquake or other act of nature provided that the reconstructed site does not increase the number of residential units; 
                  C.  Developments that already have more units that qualify as affordable to moderate, low and very low income households than this Article requires; 
                  D.  Housing constructed by other government agencies. 
                  4.26.8.  Duration of Affordability. 
                  A.  Rental Inclusionary Units. Units shall remain Affordable for a period of no less than thirty (30) years from the recordation of the Affordable Rental Agreement; 
                  B.  For Sale Single-Family Unit. Units shall remain Affordable for a period of no less than fifteen (15) years from the recordation of the Affordable Housing Agreement. 
                  4.26.9.  Affordability and Resale of For-Sale Units (Sustainability Policy). Each affordable unit created in accordance with this Section shall have limitations governing its resale. The purpose of these limitations is to preserve the long-term affordability of the unit and to ensure its continued availability for affordable income households. The resale controls shall be established through a restriction on the property and shall be in force for a period of fifteen (15) years concurrent with an equity-sharing program between the County and the homeowner. 
                  A.  Initial Sale. To ensure that only eligible households purchase affordable housing units, the purchaser of an affordable unit shall be required to submit copies of the last three years' federal and state income tax returns and certify, in writing and prior to the transfer of title, to the developer of the housing units or his/her agent, and within thirty (30) days following transfer of title, to the local housing trust, community development corporation, housing authority or other agency as established by the County, that household's annual income level does not exceed the maximum level as established by the Office of Housing, and as may be revised from time to time. 
                  B.  Maximum Cost. The maximum housing cost for affordable units created under this bylaw is as established by the Office of Housing and the Local Initiative Program or as revised by the County. 
                  C.  Resale to an Income Eligible Person Exception. The Owner of a Residential project shall sell Inclusionary Housing Units to an income-eligible Initial Owner at an Affordable Price. Thereafter for a period of fifteen (15) years from the recordation of the note or other document as provided below, the Initial Owner and any subsequent owner shall notify the Office of Housing in writing of their intent to sell the Inclusionary Unit. The Homeowner or its assignee shall have ninety (90) days from receipt of the notification to (1) identify, qualify, and refer to the seller an income-eligible purchaser or request an extension. The Initial Owner and any subsequent owner shall sell the unit to the referred purchaser at the resale price established by the Office of Housing as provided in this section. In the event that the Homeowner or its assignee does not complete the purchase of the unit within the time frames specified above, an extension for the sale of the Inclusionary Unit must be obtained from the Office of Housing. 
                  D.  Recordation of Note - Agreement or Covenant and Recapture Upon Sale. At the time of the initial sale and any subsequent sale to an income-eligible purchaser, the Office of Housing shall record an interest-bearing note, secured by a deed of trust, and/or regulatory agreement or covenant to recapture the difference between the Inclusionary Unit's market value, as determined by an appraiser approved by Office of Housing, and its Affordable Housing Price at the time of sale or resale. The Office of Housing shall also record a deed of trust encumbering any other monetary Inclusionary Incentives. The deed of trust, regulatory agreement, or covenant shall require that for a period of no less than 15 years, the unit may be resold to an income eligible purchaser. The full principal amount and interest will be due on sale to any non income eligible purchaser; due on change of use from an owner-occupied residential unit to any other use or if the Inclusionary Unit is rented; and due on any refinance of the Inclusionary Unit without the Office of Housing approval. The Office of Housing shall apply all recaptured funds to subsidize other for sale Inclusionary Housing Units. 
                  E.  Resale Price. Sales beyond the initial sale to a qualified affordable income purchaser shall include the initial discount rate between the sale price and the unit's appraised value at the time of resale. This percentage shall be recorded as part of the restriction on the property noted in this Section. For example, if a unit appraised for $100,000 is sold for $75,000 as a result of this bylaw, it has sold for 75 percent of its appraised value. If, several years later, the appraised value of the unit at the time of proposed resale is $150,000, the unit may be sold for no more than $112,500—75 percent of the appraised value of $150,000. 
                  Right of first refusal to purchase: The purchaser of an affordable housing unit developed as a result of this Odinance shall agree to execute a deed rider prepared by their attorney, consistent with model riders prepared by the Office of Housing, granting, among other things, the County's right of first refusal to purchase the property in the event that a subsequent qualified purchaser cannot be located. 
                  The Office of Housing shall require, as a condition for permitting under this Section, that the applicant comply with the mandatory set-asides and accompanying restrictions on affordability, including the execution of the deed rider noted in this Section. Community Development shall not issue an occupancy permit for any affordable unit until the deed restriction is recorded. 
                  F.  Equity Sharing Program. A homeowner is entitled to a share of the equity for each year of ownership pursuant to policies established by the Office of Housing. After the expiration of the 15 year affordability period, the homeowner must pay one half of the excess of the total resale price over the sum of: prior maximum sales price; a percentage of the affordable unit's prior purchase price with the cost of living increase since last sold; the fair market value documented capital improvements; and a reasonable sales and commission. If the amount remaining is less than $20,000, the amount due to the special revenue fund will be adjusted so the seller receives $10,000. If the amount is less than $10,000, the seller will receive the entire amount. 
                  G.  The Office of Housing Guidelines. The County Manager's Office of Housing shall adopt guidelines for the administration of this program. The guidelines may provide for a graduated increase in the rate of increase of market value over the time of ownership of a for-sale Inclusionary Unit by one Owner or for forgiveness of all or a portion of the note(s) when (1) the resale value of the Inclusionary Unit falls below the market value of the unit at its last sale; or (2) the income-eligible owner occupies the unit for a substantial period of time. 
                  4.26.10.  Occupancy Requirement. 
                  A.  Rental Units. Any person who occupies a rental Inclusionary Unit shall occupy that Unit as his or her principal residence. 
                  B.  For-Sale Units. An Individual who purchases a for-sale Inclusionary Unit shall occupy that unit as his or her principal residence, and shall certify to the Developer of the Unit or the Office of Housing that he or she is income eligible. 
                  4.26.11.  Administration of the Inclusionary Housing Component. The Inclusionary Housing Program shall be administered by two County agencies: Community Development and the County Manager's Office of Housing. Community Development shall oversee the zoning and permitting process. The Director of the Office of Housing shall be responsible for determining targeted rental and ownership affordability, resident qualifications, and monitoring the program. The Office of Housing shall conduct a study within eighteen (18) months of the 24-month voluntary period, to determine the success of the Ordinance to determine whether the Program should remain voluntary or mandatory. 
                  A.  Proposed Inclusionary Housing Plan. At the time of and as part of the application for the Inclusionary Zoning, the Developer of a Development Project shall present to Community Development and the Office of Housing a draft Inclusionary Housing Plan, which shall contain, at a level of detail appropriate to the request, the number, unit mix, location, structure type, affordability, and phasing of Inclusionary Units. If land dedication or an Off-Site location is proposed, the draft Plan shall include information necessary to establish site location, suitability, development constraints, and the number of Inclusionary Units assigned. 
                  B.  Action on Inclusionary Housing Plan. Community Development and the Office of Housing shall review the proposed Inclusionary Housing. No Zoning designation shall be granted without an adequate Inclusionary Housing Plan. The elements of the Inclusionary Housing Plan shall be incorporated into the terms and conditions of the applicable Project-specific Approvals. 
                  C.  Inclusionary Housing Agreement. 
                  1.  Requirement. No Development Agreement or Project-specific Approval may be issued by the City of Johns Creek without an executed Inclusionary Housing Agreement executed by the Owner, the Developer (if not Owner), and the Director of the Office of Housing acting with the advice of the Community Development Director. Recordation of the Agreement shall be a condition of approval of any Development Agreement, Disposition and Development Agreement or Project-level Approval. 
                  2.  Timing. The Inclusionary Housing Agreement shall be negotiated concurrently with the processing of an application for the earlier of a Development Agreement or the first Project-specific Approval. At the request of the Developer, and if Developer makes the project development and financing details set forth below in subparagraphs 3 and 4 available, the Inclusionary Housing Agreement may be negotiated earlier in connection with the issuance of a Legislative Entitlement. 
                  3.  Contents. The Agreement shall be consistent with the Inclusionary Housing Plan, and shall indicate: ownership or rental project, the number and size of Moderate, Very Low and Low income Units, the developer of the Inclusionary Units, the phasing and construction scheduling of the Units, commitments for Inclusionary Incentives, including Office of Housing commitments for Local Public Subsidy, and any other information required by the Office of Housing relative to the Inclusionary Housing Component. In the case of land dedication or Off-Site Inclusionary Housing, the Agreement shall also contain the information required in this Section. 
                  4.  Information Required from Developer. The Developer of the Development Project shall present to Community Development and the Office of Housing: (1) plans, schematics, and details of phasing of the Residential Project as a whole including the Inclusionary Housing Component; (2) financial pro-forma for the Inclusionary Housing Component with sufficient economic information to allow for evaluation of feasibility, financing and equity sources and requirements, and rates of return; (3) the name and address of the entity which will develop the Inclusionary Housing Component if not Developer; (4) in the case of land dedication, an executed irrevocable offer of dedication at no cost; (5) in the case of Off-Site location, the evidence of site control required in this Section, and (6) any other information reasonably required by the Office of Housing in connection with the Agreement. 
                  5.  Local Public Subsidy. The Developer of the Development Project may apply to the Office of Housing for Local Public Subsidy. Such an application shall contain the planning and financial information necessary to evaluate the eligibility and suitability of the project for Local Public Funding and shall include timetables or copies of proposals for External Subsidy. The application will be considered pursuant to the Office of Housing Multi Family Lending Guidelines, Office of Housing Single-Family Ownership Housing Financing Guidelines, and any Guidelines developed pursuant to this Section. The Office of Housing shall determine the Inclusionary Incentives it will make available in connection with the Residential Project as provided in this Section. The Inclusionary Housing Agreement shall specify the nature and amount of Local Public Funding. If the City of Johns Creek fails to make available the Inclusionary Incentives set forth in an executed and recorded Inclusionary Housing Agreement, the Residential Project shall be relieved of the portion of the Inclusionary Obligation that represents the percentage of local public funding committed in the Agreement but not provided. At the City of Johns Creek's option, the Agreement may provide that if the Local Public Funding component of the Inclusionary Incentives is delayed beyond the time provided for in the Agreement, the construction of Inclusionary Units may be deferred until funding availability, or that during the period of delay, the Owner may offer the Inclusionary Units as rental units at Market Rate until such time as the Local Public Funding indicated in the Agreement becomes available, at which time such rental units, upon being voluntarily vacated by existing market rate tenants, would be offered as Inclusionary Units. 
                  6.  Incorporation into Project-level Approvals and Recordation. The Developer's obligations and the Inclusionary Incentives in the Agreement shall be incorporated into the Project-specific Approvals. The executed Agreement shall be recorded as a covenant running with the land against the real property of the Residential Project and, in the case of Off-Site Inclusionary Units, against the real property on which such Units are to be located. 
                  D.  Administration of Affordability for Rental Inclusionary Housing. The Owner of rental Inclusionary Units shall be responsible for certifying the income of tenant to the Office of Housing at the time of initial rental and annually thereafter. The Owner of rental Inclusionary Units shall apply the same rental terms and conditions (except rent levels, deposits and income requirements) to tenants of Inclusionary Units as are applied to all other tenants, except as otherwise required to comply with government subsidy programs. Discrimination based on subsidies received by the prospective tenant is prohibited. The City of Johns Creek Office of Housing shall keep confidential the personal identifying information of the household members occupying an Inclusionary Unit. 
                  E.  Guidelines. The Office of Housing Multi-family Development Financing Guidelines and the Office of Housing Single-Family Ownership Housing Financing Guidelines shall apply to Inclusionary Housing developed under this Section. The Director of Community Development and Office of Housing Director may jointly develop, and either of them may adopt, additional guidelines as necessary for the implementation of this Section consistent with the terms contained herein. 
                  4.26.12.  Administrative Fees. The City of Johns Creek Mayor and City Council may by ordinance establish reasonable fees and deposits for the administration of this Section. 
                  4.26.13.  Participation.

                  C.  If the developer violates this ordinance in any way, including not constructing the required affordable units, the County may deny, suspend, or revoke any and all building or occupancy permits. The County can also withhold any additional building permits until the affordable units are built. 
                  D.  If the ordinance is violated by the sale of an affordable unit, the County can enjoin or void any transfer of the affordable unit and require the owner to sell the unit to an eligible income individual. 
                  E.  The City of Johns Creek may bring such civil and criminal enforcement actions as are provided for in the City of Johns Creek Code. 
                  4.26.15.  Severability. The City of Johns Creek Mayor and City Council hereby declares that every section, paragraph, clause and phrase of this Ordinance is severable. If, for any reason, any provision of the ordinance is held to be invalid, such invalidity shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions.

                  "(C) Permitted Uses: Sexually Oriented Businesses." 
                  "Sexually oriented businesses are permitted uses within the M-1 and M-1A Districts, only. Such uses are prohibited as uses in any and all other zoning districts." 
                  Sexually Oriented Businesses. 
                  (a)  Preamble. 
                  WHEREAS, sexually oriented businesses require special supervision from the public safety agencies of the City in order to protect and preserve the health, safety, and welfare of the patrons of such businesses as well as the citizens of the City; and 
                  WHEREAS, the City Council finds that sexually oriented businesses, as a category of establishments, are frequently used for unlawful sexual activities, including prostitution and sexual liaisons of a casual nature; and 
                  WHEREAS, there is convincing documented evidence that sexually oriented businesses, as a category of establishments, have deleterious secondary effects and are often associated with crime and adverse effects on surrounding properties; and 
                  WHEREAS, the City Council desires to minimize and control these adverse effects and thereby protect the health, safety, and welfare of the citizenry; protect the citizens from crime; preserve the quality life; preserve the character of surrounding neighborhoods and deter the spread of urban blight; and 
                  WHEREAS, there is documented evidence of sexually oriented businesses, including adult bookstores and adult video stores, manipulating their inventory and/or business practices to avoid regulation while retaining their essentially "adult" nature. See, e.g. City of New York v. Hommes, 94 N.Y.2d 267: 724 N.E.2 nd 368 (N.Y. 1999): For the People Theatres of N.Y., Inc. v. City of New York, 793 N.Y. S.2d 356; 2005 N.Y. App. Div. LEXIS 3743 (April 12, 2005): Z.J. Gifts D-4, L.L.C. v. City of Littleton, Civil Action No. 99-N-166. Memorandum Decision and Order (D. Colo. March 31, 2001) (finding "plaintiff's argument that it is not an adult entertainment establishment frivolous as best"): Taylor v. State, 202 Tex. App. LEXIS 5381 (Tex. App. 2002) (noting that "the nonadult video selections appeared old and several of its display cases were covered with cobwebs"): Illinois v. Lions' Den, Inc., June 10, 2005, Circuit Court of Fourth Judicial Circuit. Effingham County, Ill., Case 04-CH-26 (noting that "the accuracy and credibility" of the evidence on inventory in a Lion's Den was suspect, and that testimony was "less than candid" and "suggested an intention to obscure the actual amount of sexually explicit material sold"); 
                  WHEREAS, the City intends to regulate such businesses as sexually oriented businesses through a narrowly tailored ordinance designed to serve the substantial government interest in preventing the negative secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses; 
                  WHEREAS, the City's regulations shall be narrowly construed to accomplish this end; 
                  WHEREAS, with the passage of any Ordinance, the City and the City Council accept as binding the applicability of general principles of criminal and civil law and procedure and the rights and obligations under the United States and Georgia Constitutions, Georgia Code, and the Georgia Rules of Civil and Criminal Procedure; and 
                  WHEREAS, it is not the intent of the City to suppress any speech activities protected by the U.S. Constitution or the Georgia Constitution, but to enact legislation to further the content-neutral governmental interest of the City, to wit, the controlling of secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses. 
                  (b)  Purpose. It is the purpose of the Johns Creek zoning ordinance to regulate land use by sexually oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, moral, and general welfare of the citizens of the City, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses within the City. The provisions of this ordinance have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content or reasonable access to any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is neither the intent nor effect of this ordinance to restrict or deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this ordinance to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material. 
                  (c)  Rationale and Findings. Based on evidence of the adverse secondary effects of adult uses presented in hearings and in reports made available to the City Council, and on findings, interpretations, and narrowing constructions incorporated in the cases of City of Littleton v. Z.J. Gifts D-4, L.L.C., 541 U.S. 774 (2004); City of Los Angeles v. Alameda Books, Inc., 535 U.S. 425 (2002): City of Erie v. Pap's A.M., 529 U.S. 277 (2000): City of Renton v.

Jackson, 214 (1978); And based upon reports concerning secondary effects occurring in and around sexually oriented businesses, including, but not limited to, Austin, Texas - 1986: Indianapolis, Indiana - 1984; Garden Grove, California - 1991; Houston, Texas - 1983, 1997: Phoenix, Arizona - 1979, 1995-98; Chattanooga, Tennessee - 1999-2003; Los Angeles, California - 1977; Whittier, California - 1978; Spokane, Washington - 2001; St. Cloud, Minnesota - 1994; Littleton, Colorado - 2004; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma - 1986; Dallas, Texas - 1997; Montrose, Illinois - 2005; Kennedale, Texas - 2005; American Planning Association - 2001; Greensboro, North Carolina - 2003; Amarillo, Texas - 1977; New York, New York Times Square - 1994; and the Report of the Attorney General's Working Group On The Regulation Of Sexually Oriented Businesses, (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota). 
                  The City Council finds: 
                  (1)  Sexually oriented businesses, as a category of commercial uses, are associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects including, but not limited to, personal and property crimes, prostitution, potential spread of disease, lewdness, public indecency, obscenity, illicit drug use and drug trafficking, negative impacts on surrounding properties, urban blight, litter, and sexual assault and exploitation. 
                  (2)  Sexually oriented businesses should be separated from sensitive land uses to minimized the impact of their secondary effects upon such uses, and should be separated from other sexually oriented businesses, to minimize the secondary effects associated with such uses and to prevent an unnecessary concentration of sexually oriented businesses in one area. 
                  (3)  Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm which the City has a substantial government interest in preventing and/or abating. This substantial government interest in preventing secondary effects, which is the City's rationale for this ordinance exists independent of any comparative analysis between sexually oriented and non-sexually oriented businesses. Additionally, the City's interest in regulating sexually oriented businesses extends to preventing future secondary effects of either current or future sexually oriented businesses that may locate in the City. The City finds that the cases and documentation relied on in this ordinance are reasonably believed to be relevant to said secondary effects. 
                  (d)  Definitions and Standards. Sexually oriented businesses are subject to the following definitions, standards and additional standards.

                  ARTICLE XVIII. - OFF STREET PARKING AND LOADING 

                  Sec. 18.1. - Scope. 
                  The location, design and quantity of off-street parking and loading facilities for every use located in the City of Johns Creek shall comply with requirements herein. 
                  Sec. 18.2. - Parking Spaces Required. 
                  Every principle use shall be served by off-street parking spaces as specified below. Parking spaces shall serve only the designated use and shall be located on the same lot as the use unless another location is authorized in accordance with other provisions of this Zoning Ordinance. 
                  18.2.1.  Basic Off-Street Parking Requirements. Parking requirements shall be calculated based on the site's principle use. All areas are expressed in gross square feet of building area unless ground area or some other measure is specified. Parking in excess of the minimum requirements for shopping centers in excess of 50,000 square feet must be located on a pervious surface. Any fraction of one-half or larger shall constitute a whole. A bench seat shall consist of 18 inches. 

                   
                  18.2.2.  Shared Parking. The standards for shared parking may be utilized for any of the combinations of uses shown below on any number of properties when approval is reflected in the conditions of zoning for each such property. Similar provisions are provided under Off-Site And Shared Parking Requirements in the Administrative Permits article for those uses which were not zoned concurrently or as part of a multiple use project. The conditions of zoning or Administrative Permit, as applicable, establish the limits of parking requirements among uses and properties, and the City of Johns Creek shall not require any contractual relationship among property owners. 
                  The standards for determining parking requirements in a multiple use development are: 
                  A.  Determine the minimum amount of parking required for each separate use. 
                  B.  Multiply each parking requirement by the corresponding percentage for each of the time periods given below. 
                  C.  Calculate the column total parking requirement for each time period. 
                  D.  The largest column total is the shared parking requirement. 

                   
                  EXAMPLE 
                  Properties proposed for individual uses would require the following number of parking spaces: 
                  Office ..... 300 spaces 
                  Retail ..... 280 spaces 
                  Entertainment ..... 100 spaces 
                  Total ..... 680 spaces 
                  Properties proposed for multiple uses under the provisions for shared parking would require the following number of parking spaces: 

                   
                  Thus, 508 spaces would be needed for this development, a reduction of 172 spaces or 25 percent. 
                  18.2.3.  Administrative Reduction of Spaces Constructed. The Director of the Community Development Department may authorize a reduction in the total number of parking spaces constructed on a site to no less than 90 percent of the basic requirement when all of following conditions are met: 
                  A.  The request for reduction in parking shall show that the reduction is justified on the basis of characteristics unique to the specific proposed use of the property in contrast to the characteristics of other uses within the same category. 
                  B.  Prior to granting the reduction in total parking spaces constructed, the Director of the Community Development Department shall conclude that the reduction is justified, and shall approve, in whole or in part, or deny the request stating the reasons therefore in the report. 
                  Sec. 18.3. - Acceptable Locations for Off-Street Parking.

                  ARTICLE XX. - CONSERVATION SUBDIVISION ORDINANCE 

                  Sec. 20.1. - Purpose and Intent. 
                  It is the purpose and intent of this ordinance to encourage preservation of open space within residential developments; provide flexibility to allow for creativity in developments; minimize the environmental and visual impacts of new development on critical natural resources and historically and culturally significant sites and structures; provide an interconnected network of permanent open space; encourage a more efficient form of development that consumes less open land and conforms to existing topography and natural features; reduce erosion and sedimentation by minimizing land disturbance and removal of vegetation; enhance the community character; permit clustering of houses and structures which will reduce the amount of infrastructure, including paved surfaces and utility lines; encourage street design that controls traffic speeds and creates street inter-connectivity; and promote construction of convenient and accessible walking trails and bike paths both within a subdivision and connected to neighboring communities, businesses and facilities to reduce reliance on automobiles. 
                  Sec. 20.2. - Applicability of Regulations. 
                  The Conservation Subdivision option shall require a Use Permit and is available for single-family detached residential developments in the following districts: AG-1, R-1, R-2, R-2A, R-3, R-3A, R-4, R-4A, and R-5. Compliance with all applicable ordinances, regulations, or resolutions is required; however, when in conflict, the provisions of this ordinance shall prevail. 
                  Sec. 20.3. - Conservation Subdivision Density. 
                  Housing Density Determination: The maximum number of lots in the Conservation Subdivision is determined by dividing the area of the tract of land by the minimum lot size specified in the underlying zoning. In making this calculation, the following shall not be included in the total area of the parcel: 
                  a.  50% of the Primary Conservation Areas. 
                  b.  Anticipated right-of-way for roads and utilities (minimum of 18% of gross tract area). 
                  Sec. 20.4. - Lot Requirements and Tract Size. 
                  The minimum lot size in any project shall be 4,000 square feet. The total number of lots may not exceed the number of lots that could otherwise be developed under the existing zoning. 
                  The minimum tract size for the overall development shall be 10 acres. The land shall not have been used for timber harvesting within the previous 24 months. 
                  Sec. 20.5. - Minimum Lot Frontage. 
                  The minimum lot frontage on a right-of-way or private street shall be 20 feet. 
                  Sec. 20.6. - Setbacks, Building Separation, and Architectural Standards Requirements.

The 50-foot wide buffer along the property frontage may include a 20-foot landscape strip and other entrance features. 
                  Sec. 20.8. - Application Requirements. 
                  Site Analysis Map Required: Concurrent with the application of the Use Permit, Applicant shall prepare and submit a site analysis map. The purpose of the site analysis map is to ensure that the important site features have been adequately identified and that the proposed Open Space will meet the requirements of this article.

                  Sec. 20.9. - Definition of Open Space. 
                  Open Space is the portion of the conservation subdivision that has been set aside for permanent protection. Activities within the open space are restricted in perpetuity through the use of an approved legal instrument. 
                  Sec. 20.10. - Open Space Requirement. 
                  Each conservation subdivision shall provide a minimum of 40% of its total gross acreage as open space as defined by this ordinance. The open space shall be designated on the site analysis map, development plan and subsequently recorded on the final plat. 
                  Sec. 20.11. - Open Space Configuration. 
                  The minimum standards for open space are as follows: 
                  a.  The minimum width of any open space area is 25 feet. 
                  b.  All paths shall be a minimum of 20 feet from any overall project exterior property line except where interparcel access may be required. 
                  c.  All open space shall provide connectivity to any common areas within the development and to any adjacent public places/rights-of-way or as approved by the Director. 
                  d.  Paths located in primary conservation areas shall be constructed of pervious materials. 
                  e.  Where path networks cross internal subdivision streets or public streets, access points shall be directly across from each other or as approved by the Director. 
                  f.  Crossings and access points shall be clearly identified to pedestrians and motorists and may include traffic control devices, bridges and tunnels as approved by the Director. 
                  g.  Above-ground utility rights-of-way and small areas of impervious surface (i.e.: picnic table and benches) may be included within the protected Open Space but cannot be counted towards the 40 percent minimum area requirement (exception: historic structures and existing trails may be counted). Impervious areas greater than 50 square feet shall be excluded from the Open Space. 
                  h.  At least 75 percent of the Open Space shall be in a contiguous tract. The Open Space shall adjoin any neighboring areas of Open Space, other protected areas, and non-protected natural areas that would be candidates for inclusion as part of a future area of protected Open Space. 
                  Sec. 20.12. - Open Space and Conservation Areas. 
                  Open space shall be designated as either primary conservation areas or secondary conservation areas and shall remain natural and undisturbed except for permitted activities. 
                  Sec. 20.13. - Primary Conservation Areas. 
                  Primary conservation areas form the core of the open space and are required to be included within the open space. Active recreation areas are prohibited in primary conservation areas unless approved by the Director. Primary conservation areas, as defined by this ordinance, include the following: 
                  a.  Cemeteries; 
                  b.  Habitats for endangered or threatened species as defined by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources; 
                  c.  Wetlands identified by the National Wetlands Inventory maps prepared by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the County Soil Survey prepared by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service, or a certified wetlands delineation using data from the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers; 
                  d.  Alluvial soils identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and 100-Year floodplain; 
                  e.  Lakes (natural and man made), rivers, streams, existing ponds, creeks, including but not limited to blue line tributaries and state waters; 
                  f.  Riparian zones equal to any required stream buffers; stream buffers shall be a minimum of 75' undisturbed 
                  g.  Existing slopes greater than 25% on average with a site area greater than 5,000 square feet identified as part of a site analysis conducted by a registered engineer, land surveyor or landscape architect and calculated using topographic maps from the City of Johns Creek's GIS system or from a topographic survey prepared by a licensed land surveyor. 
                  Sec. 20.14. - Value of Primary Conservation Areas. 
                  Because primary conservation areas are either protected or sensitive environmental areas, 100% of the acreage of a primary conservation area may be counted as open space. 
                  Sec. 20.15. - Secondary Conservation Areas. 
                  Secondary conservation areas consist of undeveloped (unconstrained) but buildable land and protected (constrained) lands and may be included within the open space to the maximum extent feasible. Secondary conservation areas, as defined by this ordinance, include the following: 
                  a.  Farmlands (fields, pastures, meadows); 
                  b.  Woodlands and buffers except stream buffers; 
                  c.  Historic and/or archaeological sites as identified by the Fulton County Historic Resources Survey; 
                  d.  Passive recreation areas, public and private, to include pedestrian, bicycle and equestrian trails, picnic areas, community commons or greens, and similar areas; 
                  e.  Active recreation, playing fields, and playgrounds. Recreation areas with impervious surfaces (e.g., tennis courts, basketball courts and pools) and golf courses shall be excluded. 
                  Sec. 20.16. - Value of Secondary Conservation Areas. 
                  With the exception of active recreation areas and facilities, 100% of secondary conservation areas may be counted as open space. Because active recreation areas are cleared and graded and therefore reduce natural resources and wildlife habitats, only 50% of active recreation , excluding impervious surfaces, may be counted as open space. 
                  Sec. 20.17. - Open Space Protection. 
                  The required open space areas shall be protected in perpetuity from further development or unauthorized use by a conservation easement or permanent restrictive covenant (per O.C.G.A. Section 44-5-60(c)). The City of Johns Creek reserves the right to enforce all restrictive covenants and conservation easements.

                  f.  Provide for maintenance of the property; 
                  g.  Be shown on a certified survey and duly recorded with the Clerk of Superior Court prior to the issuance of a Land Disturbance Permit; and 
                  h.  Provide for amendments only with the express written permission of the property owner(s) and The City of Johns Creek. Amendments to the covenant shall be filed with the Director and shall be recorded in Superior Court. 
                  Sec. 20.20. - Maintenance of Open Space. 
                  Open space may be maintained and/or improved through reforestation, pasture management, buffer replantings, stream bank protection and wetlands management or by other means as approved by the Director.

                  Sec. 22.4. - Administrative Variance. 
                  The Director of the Department of Community Development is authorized by this Ordinance to consider an Administrative Variance whenever: (1) a property owner maintains that a provision contained in Chapter 113 (Code of Ordinances), Development Regulations, as applied to a specific situation, is not in the best interest of the public health, safety and welfare; (2) whenever there is a request for the alteration of the 10 foot improvement setback required along all buffers as required in the conditions of zoning and/or in Article 4.23.1. Minimum Landscape Strips and Buffers; and (3) whenever there is a request up to a 10% reduction in the number of required parking spaces per Article 18.2.3, Administrative Reduction of Spaces Constructed. 
                  The authority to grant an administrative variance pursuant to this Section and Section 22.5 and 22.6 is not mandatory.

                  Editor's note— Ord. No. 2015-01-03, adopted January 26, 2015, repealed the former article XXVIII, §§ 28.1—28.9, and enacted a new article XXVIII as set out herein. The former article XXVIII pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from Ord. No. 2010-05-08, adopted May 24, 2010. 

                  Sec. 28.1. - General Amendments. 
                  Whenever the public necessity, convenience, general welfare or good zoning practice justify such action, and after consideration by the Planning Commission, the Mayor and City Council may, by resolution, change the regulations set forth in this Zoning Ordinance (text amendment) or amend the Zoning Maps. Text Amendments may be initiated by either the Mayor and City Council or by the Community Development Department. 
                  In amending the Zoning Maps, the Mayor and City Council may approve a use permit and/or zoning district applied for by the applicant or a more restrictive zoning district based on the ranking of the City of Johns Creek zoning district intensities.

                  In approving any zoning district change and/or use permit, the Mayor and City Council shall impose conditions of approval as deemed necessary and appropriate to mitigate potentially adverse influences or otherwise promote the public health, safety or general welfare. 
                  Rezonings and/or use permit requests are referred to in this text as land use petitions. All land use petitions approved by the Mayor and City Council are subject to conditions approved by the Mayor and City Council.

                  At any time, the Mayor and City Council may initiate a land use petition on property which was previously rezoned. However, a six-month waiting period from the date of final Mayor and City Council action is required when a rezoning and/or use permit request was previously denied. 
                  If a petition was previously denied, the owner must demonstrate that the proposed land use petition is significantly different from the previous denial to the satisfaction of the Mayor and City Council before it can be considered for a reinitiation. A significant difference includes, but is not limited to a change in zoning district, use, density, height, buffers or other methods of screening, or other items which were discussed at a public hearing.

                  28.4.6. Noise Study Report. A noise study shall be performed, by a state registered professional engineer or noise professional, if a proposed site is located within 1,000 feet of an expressway or within 3,000 feet of an active rail line. An expressway is defined as a highway facility usually having two or more lanes for the exclusive use of traffic in each direction and partial control of access (i.e. I-85, I-285 and GA-400). 
                  1.  The noise study shall include an analysis of the proposed use with respect to existing ambient noise, that is, business and industry noise, aircraft noise, roadway noise, and construction noise.

                  28.4.7. Public Participation Plan and Report. The Public Participation Plan is to ensure that applicants pursue early and effective public participation in conjunction with their petitions, ensure that the citizens of the City of Johns Creek have an adequate opportunity to learn about petitions that may affect them, and to ensure ongoing communication between applicants, adjoining property owners, environmentally stressed communities, community associations and other organizations, elected officials and City staff. A target area for public participation should be determined by the applicant and current planner at the time of the pre-application review. Applicants are required to submit a Public Participation Plan for meeting with interested citizens to advise of pending rezoning/use permit applications and to allow citizens the opportunity to discuss concerns and provide input about project design or development. An applicant's responsibilities are to inform the public, solicit input, and provide a summary of these activities in the form of a written report (Public Participation Report). 
                  The requirement for a Public Participation Plan does not give communities decision making powers or force a consensus on issues. Applicants are not obligated to make any concessions or changes based upon input from citizens. A refusal by the community to meet with applicants does not mean that the applicants fail to meet the requirements of the Public Participation Plan. 
                  Dialogue should occur between applicants and communities before the Planning Commission hearing, the first public hearing. Public Participation Plans are required with all rezoning and/or use permit applications and must be filed simultaneously with the application. Participation Plan Reports are required to be submitted no less than fifteen (15) calendar days before the scheduled Planning Commission hearing. If the report is not submitted as required, the Mayor and City Council may defer an application. 
                  The minimum requirements for Public Participation Plans and Public Participation Reports are as follows: 
                  A.  Public Participation Plan. Every application for a rezoning or use permit which requires a public hearing shall include a Public Participation Plan which must be implemented prior to the first public hearing. 
                  Minimum Standards:

                  4.  Applicant's schedule for completion of the Public Participation Plan. 
                  B.  Public Participation Report. Every rezoning and use permit applicant is required to provide a Public Participation Report on the Department's form no later than 15 calendar days prior to the Planning Commission hearing. This report shall be made a part of the official file and a summary will be provided to the Planning Commission and the Mayor and City Council. 
                  Minimum Standards: 
                  1.  Provide a list of all parties that were contacted, the methods of notification that were used, and a copy of the notification letter(s).

                  Sec. 33.1. - General Provisions. 
                  This Article shall hereafter be known and cited as the "City of Johns Creek Sign Ordinance." 
                  Sec. 33.2. - Purpose and Findings. 
                  A.  Purpose. This Article was enacted with the following purposes: 
                  1.  To protect the rights of individuals and businesses to convey their messages through signs; 
                  2.  To encourage the effective use of signs as a means of communication; 
                  3.  To promote economic development; 
                  4.  To improve traffic and pedestrian safety as it may be affected by distracting signs; 
                  5.  To prevent the destruction of the natural beauty and environment of the City; 
                  6.  To protect the public health, safety, and general welfare; 
                  7.  To restrict the continued existence of abandoned or non-conforming signs unless in compliance with the terms of this Article and to eliminate, over time, all non-conforming signs; 
                  8.  To ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign standards; and 
                  9.  To make it easier, quicker, and more economically efficient to apply for a sign permit. 
                  B.  Findings. 
                  1.  The City finds that signs are a proper use of private property, are a means of personal free expression and a necessary component of a commercial environment. As such, signs are entitled to the protection of the law. In the absence of regulation, however, the number of such signs tends to proliferate, with property owners' desiring ever increasing numbers and sizes of signs, leading to cluttered and aesthetically blighted thoroughfares. In addition, the competition among competing sign owners for visibility of their signs contributes to safety hazards for both vehicles and pedestrians and undermines the sign owners' original purpose of presenting a clear message of its idea or identification of its premises. 
                  2.  The City further finds that the regulation of the size, height, number and spacing of signs is necessary to protect the public safety, to assure compatibility of signs with surrounding land uses, to enhance the business and economy of the City, to protect the public investment in the streets and highways, to maintain the tranquil environment of residential areas, to promote industry and commerce, to eliminate visual clutter and blight, to provide an aesthetically appealing environment, and to provide for the orderly and reasonable display of advertising for the benefit of all the City's citizens. 
                  3.  The City further finds that there is a substantial difference between signs erected by public authority and signs erected by private citizens or businesses. Signs erected by public authority are virtually all erected for the purpose of maintaining the public safety either through direct control of traffic or through provision of such type signage as street signs which enable the traveling public to know where they are located and to find where they are going. As such, with the exception of signs identifying government buildings, virtually all government signs are erected purely for public safety purposes. Moreover, their use in the public right-of-way is necessary to ensure their visibility to the motoring public. The City commission finds that public utility signs are frequently of the same nature as those signs erected by governmental entities in that they provide necessary information to safeguard the public from downed power lines and from street excavations. Even where signs serve a propriety purpose, such as identifying markings on utility polls, those signs are marked primarily for the purpose of benefiting the public generally through identification of locations where there may be temporary losses of power. 
                  4.  The City further finds that some signage has a single targeted function and that identification of such signage by description is impossible without referring to its function. For instance, address numerals are used for the sole purpose of locating addresses, which is of benefit to persons looking for those addresses and is essential to public safety personnel responding to emergencies. Subdivision signs at the entrances to subdivisions favor a similar purpose in enabling both the traveling public and emergency personnel to quickly locate subdivision entrances for the purpose of either visitation or responding to emergency calls. While such signage is referenced based upon the function it serves within the context of this ordinance, the bulk of the provisions of this chapter are unrelated to the content of the speech provided and allow maximum expressive potential to sign owners.

                  1.  The topography of the lot on which the sign is located or to be located renders it impossible to comport with the strict standards of this Article; or 
                  2.  The natural features of the lot on which the sign is located or to be located, or of the land immediately adjacent to the Lot, impairs the visibility of the sign such that it cannot be seen.

No refunds shall be made for a permit after the permit is issued. If later an individual desires to erect a sign at the same location, a new application for the sign must be processed and another fee paid in accordance with the fee schedule applicable at such time.

                  C.  Setback. Unless otherwise noted in conditions of zoning or in this Article, all signs shall set back at least ten (10) feet from the right-of-way twenty (20) feet from the edge of pavement if a private street and no sign shall project over the right-of-way. Freestanding signs shall be a minimum of twenty-five (25) feet from an intersection as measured from the edge of pavement and shall be a minimum of 35 feet from any other freestanding signs.

                  Sec. 33.23. - Measurement of Sign Area. 
                  A.  Size Generally. Except as otherwise provided herein, the area of a sign shall be computed as the area within the smallest continuous polygon comprised of not more than eight (8) straight lines enclosing the limits of a sign face, together with any sign face cabinet or frame or material, texture, or color forming an integral part of the sign face used to differentiate the sign face from the structure upon which it is placed. If polygons established around wall signs located on the same street oriented wall are within twenty-four (24) inches or less of one another, then the area of the sign shall be measured within one continuous polygon. 
                  B.  Structure. The computation of the area of a sign face shall not include the structure, supports, or uprights on which the sign face is placed or any portions of a sign structure that are not intended to contain any message or idea and are purely structural or decorative in nature, other than those parts contained within the polygon that delimits the sign face. 
                  C.  Multi-Faced Signs. For multi-faced signs, when the sign face surfaces are parallel and are back to back, or where the interior angle formed by the faces is forty-five (45) degrees or less, the area of the sign shall be taken as the areas on the largest side. For all other multi-faced signs, the area of the sign shall be the total area on all sides that can be viewed at one time from any angle. 
                  Sec. 33.24. - Measurement of Sign Height. 
                  The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the base of the sign structure at normal grade to the top of the highest attached component of the sign. Normal grade shall be construed to be the lower of: (1) existing grade prior to construction or (2) the newly established grade after construction, exclusive of any filling, berming, mounding, or excavating solely for the purpose of locating the sign. In cases in which the normal grade cannot reasonably be determined, sign height shall be computed on the assumption that the elevation of the normal grade at the base of the sign is equal to the elevation of the nearest point of the crown of a public street or the grade of the land at the principal entrance to the principal structure on the zone lot, whichever is greater. Where the normal grade is below the normal grade of a public street, the sign base can be raised to the elevation of the normal grade of the street before the height limitations are applied (surveyor's certificate required). 
                  Sec. 33.25. - Construction Standards. 
                  A.  Building and Safety Codes. All signs permitted under this code shall be constructed and maintained in accordance with the applicable City building and safety codes. The City may remove after due notice any sign which shows neglect or becomes dilapidated. 
                  B.  Faces. The face of sign shall be flat, with protrusions of no more than two (2) inches to allow for the texture of the sign and words, letters, figures, symbols, logos, fixtures, colors, or other design elements. No sign or other advertising structure shall be constructed so as to have nails, tacks, or wires protruding therefrom. Lettering for address signage shall not exceed four (4) inches in height or as required by the applicable building code. 
                  C.  Illumination. Signs, when illumination is permitted and except as otherwise set forth, may be illuminated internally or externally. Free standing signs with external illumination shall have light directed downward. Externally illuminated signs shall not exceed fifty-five (55) foot-candles. 
                  D.  Landscaping. Landscaping, weeds, and grass shall be kept cut in front of, behind, underneath, and around the base of freestanding signs. 
                  E.  Sign Materials. Freestanding sign structure/base materials shall be constructed of brick or stone with a base of at least two feet. Any sign panels on a sign shall have a uniform background color and material. All freestanding signs shall display the property address in numbers at least six (6) inches in height but not more than twelve (12) inches in height. The numerical address shall not be considered part of the sign face and shall not count against the allowable sign square footage. 
                  Sec. 33.26. - Restrictions Based on Location. 
                  If not otherwise stated, any sign not specifically allowed in a zoning district as provided under this Section shall be prohibited in that district, except as otherwise provided for under this Article. The following standards govern signs within specific zoning districts.
