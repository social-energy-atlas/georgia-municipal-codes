PREFACE

        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE                   This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of Wayne County, Georgia. 
                  Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1992 Code, as supplemented through August 6, 2017, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the board of commissioners. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1992 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
                  The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
                  Chapter and Section Numbering System 
                  The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
                  Page Numbering System 
                  The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

                   
                  Indexes 
                  The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross-references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
                  Looseleaf Supplements 
                  A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
                  Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
                  Acknowledgments 
                  This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Senior Code Attorney, and Rebecca D. Evans, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida.

                  The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Andy R.

               Editor's note— Part I contains local constitutional amendments and state laws of local application. Amendments to the original Acts are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision derives unchanged from the original Act. A uniform system of punctuation and capitalization has been used. Obvious misspellings have been corrected without notation, and material in brackets [ ] has been added for clarity. The title, enactment, severability, repealer, transitional, ratification, publication and effective date provisions have been omitted, and where a section has been amended or repealed by a later provision, only the current language has been printed. The original titles, catchlines, chapter numbers, article numbers and section numbers have been retained to maintain consistency with the original Act. Formal citations should be to the original act and not to this compilation. 
               
               ARTICLE I. - BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS[2]

               --- (2) --- 
               Editor's note— Printed in this article is 1962 Ga. Laws page 3110. Amendments are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original. Obvious misspellings have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes, the same style of expression of numbers in text as appears in the Code of Ordinances has been used. A consistent scheme of capitalization has also been used. Pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 36-5-20 the words "roads and revenues" have been stricken from the name of the governing authority. The title of the Act has been omitted. Other additions for clarity are indicated by brackets. 
               
               Sec. 1. - Board of commissioners established. 
               There is hereby created in and for the County of Wayne a board of commissioners to be elected and organized, as hereinafter set forth, which board of commissioners shall constitute the governing authority of said county and shall exercise the powers, duties and responsibilities specified herein and imposed upon said officers by the laws of the State of Georgia. 
               Sec. 2. - Commissioner districts. 
               (a)  The board of commissioners of Wayne County shall be composed of five members who shall be elected as provided in this Act. For purposes of electing members of the board of commissioners, Wayne County is divided into five commissioner districts. The districts shall be and correspond to those five numbered districts described in and attached to and made a part of this Act and further identified as "Plan: wayneccsbR-2012 Plan Type: Local Administrator: Wayne User: Gina." 
               (b)  For purposes of such plan: 
               (1)  The term "VTD" shall mean and describe the same geographical boundaries as provided in the report of the Bureau of the Census for the United States decennial census of 2010 for the State of Georgia. The separate numeric designations in a district description which are underneath a VTD heading shall mean and describe individual blocks within a VTD as provided in the report of the Bureau of the Census for the United States decennial census of 2010 for the State of Georgia. 
               (2)  Except as otherwise provided in the description of any commissioner district, whenever the description of such district refers to a named city, it shall mean the geographical boundaries of that city as shown on the census map for the United States decennial census of 2010 for the State of Georgia. 
               (c)  Any part of Wayne County which is not included in any such district described in subsection (a) of this section shall be included within that district contiguous to such part which contains the least population according to the United States decennial census of 2010 for the State of Georgia. 
               (d)  Any part of Wayne County which is described in subsection (a) of this section as being in a particular district shall nevertheless not be included within such district if such part is not contiguous to such district. Such noncontiguous part shall instead be included within that district contiguous to such part which contains the least population according to the United States decennial census of 2010 for the State of Georgia. 
               (1982 Ga. Laws, page 3789; 1982 Ga. Laws, page 4717; 1994 Ga. Laws, page 3520, § 1; 2001 Ga. Laws (Ex. Sess.), page 676, § 1; 2012 Ga. Laws, page 4548, § 1) 
               Sec. 3. - Elections and terms of office. 
               (a)  A commissioner shall be elected from each of the five commissioner districts described in section 2 of this Act. No person shall be a member of the board if that person is ineligible for such office pursuant to Code section 45-2-1 of the O.C.G.A. [(O.C.G.A. § 45-2-1)] or any other general law applicable to that office. In order to be elected as a member of the board from a commissioner district, a person must receive the number of votes cast as required by general law for that office in that district only. Only electors who are residents of that commissioner district may vote for a member of the board for that district. At the time of qualifying for election as a member of the board from a commissioner district, each candidate for such office shall specify the commissioner district for which that person is a candidate. A person elected or appointed as a member of the board from a commissioner district must continue to reside in that district during that person's term of office or that office shall become vacant. 
               (b)  The members of the reconstituted board of commissioners of Wayne County shall be elected at the general election on the Tuesday next following the first Monday in November 2014. The members of the board elected thereto in 2014 shall take office on January [1] immediately following that election for terms of office which expire December 31, 2018, and upon the election and qualification of their respective successors. Future successors to members of the board whose terms of office are to expire shall be elected at the time of the November statewide general election immediately preceding the expiration of such terms, shall take office on the first day of January immediately following that election, and shall have terms of office of four years each and until their respective successors are elected and qualified. 
               (c)  All members of the board who are elected thereto shall be nominated and elected in accordance with chapter 2 of title 21 of the O.C.G.A., [(O.C.G.A. § 21-2-1 et seq.)], [known as] the Georgia Election Code. 
               (1968 Ga. Laws, page 2746; 1982 Ga. Laws, page 3789; 1982 Ga. Laws, page 4717; 1994 Ga. Laws, page 3520, § 2; 2001 Ga. Laws (Ex. Sess.), page 676, § 2; 2012 Ga. Laws, page 4548, § 2) 
               Sec. 4. - Additional qualifications. 
               In addition to the residency requirements of section 3 of this act, members of the board of commissioners shall be citizens of Georgia who are at least 25 years of age on the date of taking office and who are qualified electors of Wayne County. No member of the board of commissioners shall be eligible to hold any other office of the county or of the State of Georgia while holding office as a member of the board. 
               (1982 Ga. Laws, page 3789; 1982 Ga. Laws, page 4717) 
               Sec. 5. - Vacancies. 
               (a)  All vacancies in the membership of the board of commissioners occurring within one year or less of the expiration of the term of office shall be filled by appointment of the remaining members of the board. All vacancies occurring in the membership of the board more than one year [from the expiration of the term of office] shall be filled by special election within the respective commissioner district wherein the vacancy occurred. A special election hereunder shall be called by the election superintendent of Wayne County within 30 days after the occurrence of the vacancy, and shall be held and conducted in accordance with the applicable provisions of chapter 2 of title 21 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated [(O.C.G.A. § 21-2-1 et seq.)], known as the Georgia Election Code. 
               (b)  If a commissioner ceases to be a resident of his or her respective commissioner district during the term of office, a vacancy shall thereby be created and shall be filled in the same manner as other vacancies are filled. Any person appointed or elected to fill a vacancy shall possess the residency and other qualifications necessary to hold office as a commissioner. 
               (1982 Ga. Laws, page 3789; 1982 Ga. Laws, page 4717) 
               Sec. 6. - Oath of office. 
               The commissioners designated as constituting the board of commissioners hereinabove and each commissioner hereafter elected or appointed to the office of commissioner shall, before assuming the duties of such office, take and subscribe the following oath, viz.: "I solemnly swear that I will faithfully and impartially perform my duties as a member of the board of commissioners of Wayne County during my continuance in office. I further swear that I am not the holder of any public funds unaccounted for. So help me God." 
               Sec. 7. - Bonding commissioners. 
               Before entering upon the duties of [his] office, each commissioner shall give a satisfactory surety bond executed by a bonding company authorized to do business in the State of Georgia, in an amount of $5,000.00 each, to be approved by the judge of the probate court of said county and payable to the judge of the probate court of said county, for the use of said county, conditioned upon the faithful performance of the duties of the office. The costs of each such bond shall be paid out of the county treasury. No member of the board shall serve until said bond has been filed and approved. 
               Sec. 8. - Compensation. 
               Members of the board herein created shall be paid, as their entire compensation for services, the sum of $150.00 per month, payable monthly out of the treasury of the county. In addition thereto, each member shall be entitled to recover from the county the actual expenses expended by him while engaged in county business, which said claim for expenses shall be accompanied by an affidavit executed by each such member, swearing that the same is true and correct and was expended by him while so engaged. 
               (1983 Ga. Laws, page 3219; 1973 Ga. Laws, page 3682; 1974 Ga. Laws, page 3148) 
               Sec. 9. - Recall. 
               Each member of the board of commissioners shall be subject to recall at any time after his election. The petition for such recall election must be signed by not less than 15 percent of the qualified registered voters of said county who were on the list of registered voters for the last general election. Every person signing such petition must sign the same in the office of the judge of the probate court of Wayne County, and it must be signed in the presence of the judge of the probate court, or of an employee of the probate court. The person or persons sponsoring such petition shall address such petition to the judge of the probate court, petitioning him to call for a special election to submit the question of whether any member of the board shall be recalled. The judge of the probate court shall allow such person or persons, from time to time, to count the number of names on said petition in order to determine whether a sufficient number of people have signed the petition. Such person or persons must notify the judge of the probate court when they desire to officially present the petition to him; provided, however, that no such petition shall be presented to the judge of the probate court more than 15 days after it is placed in the judge of the probate court's office for the purpose of obtaining signatures thereon. Any petition presented after such 15-day period shall be void and of no force and effect. It shall then be the duty of the judge of the probate court to determine whether such petition bears the proper percentage of names and to determine the sufficiency of the petition. For this purpose, the clerk of the superior court of Wayne County is hereby directed to furnish the judge of the probate court with a list of the registered voters for the last general election. The judge of the probate court must make his decision on the sufficiency of the petition within 15 days after the same is formally presented to him. In the event he determines that the petition is in order, it shall be his duty to issue the call for an election, and such call shall be issued within five days after he determines that such petition is in order. He shall set the date of the election for not less than 20 nor more than 30 days from the date of the issuance of the call and shall publish the date and purpose of such election once a week for two weeks immediately preceding the date thereof. The ballots used in such election shall state the name of the member of the board whose recall has been petitioned, and shall designate the district number of such member. The ballot shall have written or printed thereon, the words, "For recall of (name of member) (district number)" and "Against recall of (name of member) (district number)." The judge of the probate court shall forthwith publish the results of such election, and if a majority of those voting in such election have voted in favor of recall, the position in question shall be vacated from the date of such recall election, and the member so removed shall not be eligible to re-election or appointment to the unexpired term. If a majority of those voting in such election vote against recall, the member shall retain his office. Vacancies created by a recall election shall be filled in the same manner as herein provided for the filling of other vacancies. In the event a recall election results in a majority of votes against recall, no additional recall election against the same member shall be held for at least two years. 
               Editor's note— Pursuant to art. VI, § VI, ¶ IV of the Constitution of Georgia of 1976, the word "ordinary" has been changed to "judge of the probate court" or "probate court." 
               Sec. 10. - Chairman. 
               At [its] first regular meeting after the approval of this Act, and at the first regular meeting in each year thereafter, the board of commissioners shall, by majority vote, elect one of [its] number as chairman. The chairman shall serve at the pleasure of a majority of the members of the board and may be removed at any time by a majority vote without notice, cause or hearing. It shall be the duty of the chairman to act as presiding officer at all meetings of the board of commissioners, and he shall be recognized as [the] ceremonial head of the county government, but shall have no other administrative duties, except as herein provided, or such as may be delegated to him by the board of commissioners. In the event of the absence, disqualification or disability of the chairman, the members of the board shall appoint and designate some member of [its] body to act as temporary chairman. It shall be the duty of the chairman to preserve order and decorum at all meetings of the board, to state every question coming before the board, announce the decision of the board on all subjects and decide all questions of order; subject, however, to an appeal to the board, in which event, a majority vote of the board shall govern and conclusively determine such question of order. The chairman shall have the right to vote on all matters coming before the board and shall have the right to move for the adoption of any resolutions or other matters coming before the board. 
               Sec. 11. - Quorum. 
               Three members of the board of commissioners shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of all business which may come before them. 
               Sec. 12. - Meetings. 
               All regular meetings of the board of commissioners shall be held on the first Tuesday in each month at 10:00 a.m., at the courthouse in Wayne County, Georgia, and said meetings may be adjourned from day to day until all business is completed. Extra sessions or special meetings may be held at any time on the call of the chairman or by any two members of the board. Whenever a special meeting is called, notice shall be given by the clerk of the board to each member of the board, in writing, setting forth the date, hour and place of the meeting, and the purpose for which the same is called, and no business shall be transacted at such special meeting, except such as is given in the notice, without the unanimous consent of the entire board of commissioners. Notice and purpose of meetings may be waived. All such notices shall be served by leaving the same at the home of each such member or by delivering the same to him in person. All meetings, both regular and special, shall be open to the public; provided, however, that the board shall have the right to hold executive sessions; provided further, that no official action or vote on any proposition or question coming before the board shall be taken at other than a public meeting. 
               Sec. 13. - Enforcement of decorum. 
               The board of commissioners shall have the right to appoint a sergeant-at-arms of all commission meetings, whose duty it shall be to carry out the orders of the chairman in all matters relative to maintaining order and decorum. 
               Sec. 14. - Rules of procedure. 
               It shall be the duty of the board of commissioners to adopt rules of order and bylaws by which all meetings shall be conducted, said rules of order and bylaws to be spread upon the minutes of the board. 
               Sec. 15. - [Clerk of the commissioners—Office created.] 
               There is hereby created the office of clerk of the commissioners of Wayne County, Georgia, who shall be appointed by the county administrator. The county administrator shall have the authority to fix the salary of the clerk and to remove the clerk at any time without notice, statement or proof of cause. No member of the board of commissioners shall be eligible to hold the office of clerk during his or her continuance in office nor within 12 months after the expiration of the term, nor within 12 months after resignation or removal from the office of commissioner. No member of the immediate family of the county administrator or of members of the board shall be eligible to serve as clerk. The county administrator shall have the authority to appoint an assistant clerk, should the same be deemed necessary. 
               (1963 Ga. Laws, page 2301) 
               Sec. 16. - [Same—Duties.]

               The board of commissioners may designate some qualified person to act as temporary county administrator in the absence of the county administrator, provided that no member of the board of commissioners shall be appointed as acting county administrator. While so engaged, the acting county administrator shall have all of the rights, duties and authority of the county administrator.

               [Sec. 1. - Created; membership; etc.] 
               A.  There is hereby created a body corporate and politic in Wayne County, Georgia, to be known as the Wayne County Industrial Development Authority, which shall be an instrumentality of Wayne County and a public corporation, and which, in this amendment, is hereafter referred to as the "authority." 
               B.  The authority shall consist of a board of seven directors. The initial directors and their terms of office shall be as follows: Logan Dent, H. Lindsay Grace and John D. Mattox shall serve as directors for a term of six years; Olin Harper and C.M. Knight shall serve as directors for a term of four years; and Ernest Knight and A.N. Rogers shall serve as directors for a term of two years.

The board of commissioners of roads and revenue of Wayne County shall appoint all subsequent directors to membership on the authority. All vacancies occurring on the authority shall be filled by the board of commissioners of roads and revenue of Wayne County for the unexpired term of the director who has vacated his office. 
               A majority of the members shall constitute a quorum, and a majority may act for the authority in any matter. No vacancy shall impair the power of the authority to act. 
               C.  The property, obligations and the interest on the obligations of the authority shall have the same immunity from taxation as the property, obligations and interest on the obligations of Wayne County. 
               D.  The powers of the authority shall include, but in no way be limited to, the powers as hereinafter set out: 
               (1)  To receive and administer gifts, grants and donations and to administer trusts; 
               (2)  To borrow money; to issue notes, bonds and revenue certificates; to execute trust agreements or indentures; and to sell, convey, mortgage, pledge and assign any and all of its funds, property and income as security therefor; 
               (3)  To contract with political subdivisions of the State of Georgia and with private persons and corporations to sue and be sued in its corporate name; 
               (4)  To have and exercise usual powers of private corporations, except such as are inconsistent with this amendment, including the power to appoint and hire officers, agents and employees and to provide their compensation and duties, which officers and agents may or may not be members of the authority; and the power to adopt and amend a corporate seal and bylaws and regulations for the conduct and management of the authority; 
               (5)  To encourage and promote the expansion and development of industrial and commercial facilities in Wayne County, so as to relieve insofar as possible unemployment within its boundaries, and to that end, to acquire by purchase or gift any building or structure within the limits of Wayne County, suitable for and intended for use as a factory, mill, shop, processing plant, assembly plant or fabricating plant, including all necessary and appurtenant lands and appurtenances thereto, and all necessary or useful furnishings, machinery and equipment. Such acquisition may be through the acquisition of land and the construction thereon of a building, including the demolition of existing structures, or through the acquisition of an existing building and the remodeling, renovating, reconstructing, furnishing and equipping of such building; 
               (6)  No building acquired hereunder shall be operated by the authority but shall be leased or sold to one or more persons, firms or corporations. If sold, the purchase price may be paid at one time or in installments falling due in not more than 30 years from the date of transfer of possession. The lessee or purchaser shall be required to pay all costs of operating and maintaining the building or buildings and to pay rentals or installments sufficient, together with other revenues which may be pledged for the purpose, to retire all bonds, both principal and interest, and to pay all other expenses which the authority may have incurred in connection with the undertaking; 
               (7)  To accumulate its funds from year to year and to invest accumulated funds in any manner that public funds of the State of Georgia or any of its political subdivisions may be invested; 
               (8)  To designate officers to sign and act for the authority generally or in any specific matter; 
               (9)  To do any and all acts and things necessary or convenient to accomplish the purpose and powers of the authority, as herein stated. 
               E.  The authority shall not be authorized to create in any manner any debt, liability or obligation against the State of Georgia or Wayne County. 
               F.  The members of the authority shall receive no compensation for their services to the authority, but shall be reimbursed for their actual expenses incurred in the performance of their duties. 
               G.  In order to finance any undertaking within the scope of its power or to refund any bonds then outstanding, the authority is hereby authorized to issue bonds bearing [a] rate or rates of interest and maturing at the years and amounts determined by the authority in all respects, in accordance with the Revenue Bond Law (Ga. L. 1937, p. 761), as amended, Ga. Code Ann. Supp. chapter 87 [O.C.G.A. § 36-82-1 et seq.], as if said obligations had been originally authorized to be issued thereunder; provided, however, that any property, real or personal, of the authority may be pledged, mortgaged, conveyed, assigned, hypothecated or otherwise encumbered as security for any lawful debt of the authority. The authority may execute any trust agreement or indenture not in conflict with the provisions of this amendment to provide security for any bonds issued, as provided herein, and such trust agreement or indenture may provide for foreclosure or forced sale of any property of the authority upon default on such bonds either in payment of principal or interest or under any term or condition under which such bonds are issued. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to create a right to compel any exercise of the taxing power of Wayne County to pay any such bonds or the interest thereon nor to enforce payment thereof against any property of Wayne County. 
               H.  The authority may authorize additional bonds for extensions and permanent improvements to any industrial building acquired hereunder, to be placed in escrow and to be negotiated from time to time as proceeds for that purpose may become necessary. Bonds so placed in escrow shall, when sold and delivered, have such standing with the bonds of the same issue as may be provided in the authorizing proceedings. 
               I.  No bonds except refunding bonds shall be issued hereunder, [un]less the authority will have found and declared that: 
               (1)  The undertaking for which the bonds are to be issued will increase employment in Wayne County. 
               (2)  The lessee or purchaser of the building or buildings involved will not, by virtue of establishing operations in said county, reduce the number of employees employed by said lessee or purchaser elsewhere in the State of Georgia. 
               J.  No moneys derived by the authority from any source other than gifts and contributions from private individuals, firms, or corporations shall at any time be used for entertainment or other promotional expenses. 
               K.  Should said authority for any reason be dissolved, title to all property of every kind and nature, real and personal, held by the authority at the time of such dissolution shall revert to Wayne County, subject to any mortgages, liens, leases or other encumbrances outstanding against or in respect to said property at that time. 
               L.  This amendment is adopted for the purpose of promoting and expanding for the public good and welfare industry and trade within Wayne County and reducing unemployment to the greatest extent possible, and this amendment and any law enacted with reference to the authority shall be liberally construed for the accomplishment of these purposes. 
               M.  This amendment shall be effective immediately upon proclamation of its ratification by the governor, and the first members of the authority shall be appointed within 30 days after such proclamation. 
               N.  The general assembly may by law further define and prescribe the powers and duties of the authority and the exercise thereof, and may enlarge and restrict the same, and may likewise further regulate the management and conduct of the authority. The authority shall be an instrumentality of Wayne County, and the scope of its operations shall be limited to the territory embraced within said county. The general assembly shall not extend the jurisdiction of the authority nor the scope of its operations beyond such limits.

                  (a)  All ordinances passed subsequent to this Code which amend, repeal or in any way affect this Code, may be numbered in accordance with the numbering system of this Code and printed for inclusion herein. In the case of the repeal of chapters, sections and subsections or any part thereof by subsequent ordinances, such repealed portions may be excluded from this Code by omission from reprinted pages affected thereby.

                  (a)  By contract or by county personnel, supplements to this Code shall be prepared on an annual basis. A supplement to the Code shall include all substantive, permanent and general parts of ordinances passed by the board of commissioners during the period covered by the supplement and all changes made thereby in the Code. The pages of a supplement shall be so numbered that they will fit properly into the Code and will, where necessary, replace pages that have become obsolete or partially obsolete, and the new pages shall be so prepared that, when they have been inserted, the Code will be current through the date of the adoption of the latest ordinance included in the supplement. 
                  (b)  In preparing a supplement to this Code, all portions of the Code which have been repealed shall be excluded from the Code by the omission thereof from reprinted pages.

For example, the codifier may: 
                  (1)  Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions. 
                  (2)  Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles. 
                  (3)  Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the Code and, where necessary to accommodate new material, change existing section or other subdivision numbers. 
                  (4)  Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case may be, or to "sections ____________ to ____________ " (inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code). 
                  (5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meanings of ordinance sections inserted into the Code; but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code.

                  (c)  Except as otherwise provided: 
                  (1)  A person convicted of a violation of this Code shall be punished by a fine not exceeding $1,000.00 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 60 days, or any combination thereof. 
                  (2)  With respect to violations of this Code that are continuous with respect to time, each day the violation continues is a separate offense. 
                  (3)  With respect to violations of this Code that are not continuous with respect to time, each act is a separate offense. 
                  (d)  The imposition of a penalty does not prevent revocation or suspension of a license, permit or franchise or other administrative sanctions. 
                  (e)  Violations of this Code that are continuous with respect to time are a public nuisance and may be abated by injunctive or other equitable relief and by such other means as are provided by law. The imposition of a penalty does not prevent equitable relief.

                  (a)  Open meetings. All meetings of the board of commissioners shall be held in accordance with the provisions of O.C.G.A. title 50, ch. 14 (O.C.G.A. § 50-14-1 et seq.). The public shall at all times be afforded access to all meetings other than executive sessions. 
                  (b)  Executive sessions. As provided below or in accordance with state law, the board may close a portion of a meeting to the public to discuss certain topics that are exempted from O.C.G.A. title 50, ch. 14 (O.C.G.A. § 50-14-1 et seq.). Such meetings shall be referred to as executive sessions. Any portion of the meeting not subject to any exemptions authorized by law shall be open to the public. 
                  (1)  Procedure for entering into executive sessions. An executive session shall not be held except pursuant to a majority affirmative vote of the board of commissioners taken in an open meeting. The minutes of the open meeting shall reflect the names of the commissioners present, those voting for the executive session, and the specific reasons for the executive session. 
                  (2)  Who can attend executive sessions. Board members and only individuals necessary to conduct an executive session may be present. The clerk of the board of commissioners and the county administrator shall be included in any executive session approved by the board of commissioners unless expressly barred by majority vote of the board prior to or during the course of an executive session. The county attorney or other attorney representing the board must be included in any executive session pertaining to litigation or claims against the county. Other individuals may be invited to participate in an executive session by majority vote of the board prior to or during the course of the executive session, but only if the presence of such individuals is consistent with the applicable exception authorizing the executive session. No other individuals shall be permitted in the executive session. 
                  (3)  Non-exempt topics. If a commissioner or any other person in an executive session attempts to discuss a non-exempt topic during an executive session, the chair shall immediately rule that commissioner or other person out of order and such discussion shall cease. If the commissioner or other person persists in discussing the non-exempt topic, the chair shall adjourn the meeting immediately.

                  b.  Other executive sessions. Minutes of executive sessions devoted to any topic other than land acquisition may be maintained by the clerk at the direction of the chair. Any such minutes shall be maintained in a confidential file and shall not be subject to disclosure. 
                  (5)  Chair or presiding officer affidavit. The chair or other presiding officer shall execute an affidavit stating, under oath, that the executive session was devoted to topics exempt from the public access requirements. The affidavit shall include the specific exemption to the Open Meetings Law. The affidavit shall be notarized and filed with the minutes of the open meeting. 
                  (6)  Discussion of executive session business. 
                  a.  Commissioners, officials, employees and other individuals who attend executive sessions are prohibited from discussing or in any other way disclosing confidential information, legal advice and/or legal strategy discussed in the executive session unless: 
                  1.  The disclosure is required by law; 
                  2.  The disclosure is part of a judicial or administrative proceeding; or 
                  3.  The majority of the board authorizes the disclosure. 
                  b.  In no way shall this subsection prevent a county attorney or other attorney representing the board from discussing any matters discussed in executive session relative to settlement or negotiation of a lawsuit or other claim against the county. 
                  c.  Any commissioner that divulges, has previously divulged or has threatened to divulge confidential information, legal advice or strategy discussion may be excluded from participation in an executive session by majority affirmative vote of the board of commissioners. A commissioner that divulges confidential information, legal advice, or strategy discussions may be publicly sanctioned by a majority affirmative vote of the board of commissioners. 
                  (c)  Visual and sound recordings. Visual, sound, and visual and sound recordings shall be permitted for all open meetings. 
                  (d)  Quorum, etc. Any commissioner may raise a point of order directed to the chair if he believes that a quorum is not present. If, during the course of a meeting, a commissioner leaves and a quorum no longer exists, the meeting may not continue. If a quorum is not attained within 30 minutes, the meeting may be rescheduled by the chair with the approval of a majority of the commissioners present. 
                  (e)  Chair. The chair of the board of commissioners, as presiding officer, is responsible for the orderly conduct of the meeting. In order to fulfill this duty, the chair shall enforce the rules of procedure that are adopted by the board of commissioners. The chair shall be impartial and conduct the meetings in a fair manner. The chair may introduce motions or second motions. 
                  (f)  Presiding officer. If the chair and the vice-chair are absent or otherwise unable to serve as presiding officer at a meeting, and a quorum of commissioners is present, the remaining commissioners shall select a commissioner to serve as presiding officer of the meeting until either the chair or vice-chair is present at the meeting. 
                  (g)  Parliamentarian. The county attorney shall serve as the parliamentarian for board meetings. 
                  (h)  Rules of order; amendments to the rules. The board of commissioners shall adopt rules of order to govern the conduct of meetings of the board. Any amendments to the rules of order shall be submitted by a commissioner in writing to the county clerk three business days before a regular meeting of the board. The proposed amendment shall be included in the agenda for that meeting and distributed to all board members. All amendments require a two-thirds vote of the board to be adopted. 
                  (i)  Suspending the rules of order. Rules of order may be suspended in the case of an emergency. A motion to suspend the rules requires a second, is debatable, and requires a two-thirds vote of the board. Rules governing quorums (subsection (d) of this section), voting methods and requirements (subsections (p) and (q) of this section), notification to commissioners of meetings (subsections (k)(1) and (2) of this section) and rules necessary for compliance with state law may not be suspended; provided, however, that in the event that a state of emergency is declared by the governor or other authorized state official, the board may waive time-consuming procedures and formalities imposed by state law. 
                  (j)  Regular meetings. Regular meetings of the board of commissioners shall be held at 7:00 p.m. on the first Monday each month. All regular meetings shall be held in the meeting room at the county administration building. A notice containing the foregoing information shall be posted and maintained in a conspicuous place available to the general public at the regular meeting place of the board. 
                  (k)  Meetings other than regular meetings. The board may meet at times and locations other than those regularly scheduled meetings. 
                  (1)  Special meetings and rescheduled regular meetings. A regular meeting may be canceled, rescheduled or moved to a new location within the county seat by the chair for any reason. Other special meetings may be scheduled by the chair or at the request of at least two commissioners. Whenever a rescheduled regular meeting or any other special meeting is to be held at a time or place other than the regularly scheduled time or place, written notice of the change shall be posted for at least 24 hours at the regular meeting place. In addition, written or oral notice shall be given by the clerk at least 24 hours in advance of the meeting to either the legal organ of the county or a newspaper having general circulation at least equal to that of the legal organ, as well as to each member of the county governing authority. 
                  (2)  Meetings with less than 24 hours' notice. When emergency circumstances occur, the board may hold a meeting with less than 24 hours' notice to the public. When such meetings are to be held, the clerk shall provide notice to the legal organ of the county or a newspaper with a general circulation at least equal to that of the legal organ and to each member of the county governing authority as soon as possible. The notice shall include the subjects expected to be considered at the meeting. In addition, the minutes shall reflect the reason for the emergency meeting and the nature of the notice given to the media. 
                  (3)  Meetings during a state of emergency. When it is imprudent, inexpedient or impossible to hold board meetings at the regular meeting place due to emergency or disaster resulting from manmade or natural causes, as declared by the governor or other authorized state official, the board may meet anywhere within or outside of the county. Such a meeting may be called by the chair or by any two commissioners. At the meeting, the commissioners shall establish and designate emergency temporary meeting locations where public business may be transacted during the emergency. Any action taken in such meetings shall have the same effect as if performed at the regular meeting site. 
                  (l)  Order of business. All regular board meetings shall substantially follow an established order of business. The order shall be as follows:

                  (m)  Agenda. The county clerk, with the advice of the chair and the commissioners, shall prepare an agenda of subjects to be acted on for each meeting. The agenda shall be made available to the commissioners at least two business days before every board meeting. 
                  (1)  Requests for agenda items. 
                  a.  County commissioners who wish to have an item placed on the agenda must submit an agenda request with supporting documentation to the county clerk by 5:00 p.m. on Monday prior to the meeting.

                  2.  The amount of money required to implement the agenda item, if any, including whether the money has been appropriated, and the budget line number, as appropriate. 
                  3.  A clear statement of the agenda request, including why it is needed and its impact upon the county. 
                  4.  A summary of any requirements, laws, regulations or ordinances that necessitate the agenda item or apply to the agenda item (e.g., purchasing ordinance, advertising requirements, certifications, etc.) and a statement as to whether these requirements have been satisfied or will be satisfied. 
                  5.  A list of any options or alternatives that the board has in approving the request. 
                  6.  A statement regarding the impact of the requested agenda item on other county departments. 
                  7.  Analysis from the legal department or information technology department, if available. 
                  8.  A recommendation for board action on the requested agenda item. 
                  c.  Members of the public may request that a particular subject be placed on the agenda for a meeting. To be considered, this request shall be submitted in writing to the county clerk by 5:00 p.m. on Monday prior to the meeting. 
                  (2)  Changing the agenda. The order of the agenda may be changed during a meeting by a majority vote of the board. A new item, other than a zoning decision, may be added to the agenda by a two-thirds vote of the board only if it becomes necessary to address the item during the meeting. 
                  (3)  Agenda must be made public. The agenda of all matters to come before the board shall be made available to the public upon request and shall be posted at the meeting site and on the county's website as far in advance as reasonably possible, but not more than two weeks prior to the meeting. 
                  (n)  Consent agenda. A consent agenda may be prepared by the county administrator for the board to unanimously adopt on routine items. Any items of business that are expected to receive unanimous approval without debate may be placed on a consent agenda. At the appropriate time of the meeting, the chair shall read all of the items on the consent agenda. If a commissioner objects to an item being on the consent agenda, the chair shall move that particular item to the regular agenda. Following the reading of the consent agenda, the chair may ask for unanimous approval of the items on the consent agenda. If there are no objections, all the items on the consent agenda shall be approved by a majority vote of the board.

These limits may be waived by a majority of the commissioners present at the meeting. 
                  (2)  Public participation on agenda items. By majority vote, the board may allow public comment on an agenda item at the time the item is being considered by the board. These comments shall be limited to the subject that is being debated. Members of the public may speak for five minutes and may speak only once. These limits may be waived by a majority vote of the board. Anyone wishing to speak at any board meeting must be recognized by the chair before addressing the board. 
                  (3)  Decorum. Members of the public are expected to comply with the rules of decorum established in subsection (o) of this section. Individuals violating any rules of the board may be ruled out of order by the chair or on a point of order made by a commissioner. A majority vote of the board shall rule on the point out of order. An individual violating the rules of decorum may be removed from the meeting at the direction of the chair. 
                  (4)  Public hearings. The board may schedule public hearings for the purpose of soliciting public comment on any subject of interest to the board.

The minutes shall specify the names of commissioners present at the meeting, a description of each motion or other proposal made at the meeting, the name of the commissioner who proposed each motion, the name of the commissioner who seconded each motion, and a record of all votes. In the case of a roll call vote, the name of each commissioner voting for or against a proposal shall be recorded. It shall be presumed that a commissioner has voted in the affirmative unless the minutes show otherwise. More detailed information may be included in the minutes at the request of the board. 
                  (2)  The board shall approve the minutes before they may be considered as an official record of the board. The minutes shall be open for public inspection once approved as official by the board, but in no case later than immediately following the next regular meeting of the board. A copy of the minutes from the previous meeting shall be distributed to the commissioners at least three business days before the following meeting. The minutes of the previous meeting shall be corrected, if necessary, and approved by the board at the beginning of each meeting. A majority vote is required for approval. Conflicts regarding the content of the minutes shall be decided by a majority vote. Upon being approved, the minutes shall be signed by the chair and attested to by the clerk of the board of commissioners. 
                  (t)  Maintenance of minutes and other documents. Minutes shall be maintained in the offices of the board of commissioners. Copies of contracts, maps or similar documents related to actions by the commissioners during a meeting may be included in or attached to the minutes or incorporated by reference to an alternative location. Unless otherwise specified in the ordinance or resolution, contracts, maps or similar documents not included in or attached to the minutes shall be stored in the office of the county clerk. 
                  (u)  Committees. The chair, with the concurrence of the board, may create committees of members of the board to study any issue before the board. Any such committees may make recommendations to the board of commissioners but no committee shall be empowered to make any final decision on any matter before it for consideration. In addition to board members, committees may include other county officials, staff or citizens at large. Whenever a committee is created, its duties, any limitation on the scope of its duties, and the times, places, and periods of time for which the committee may operate shall be determined by the chair with the concurrence of the board. The chair shall serve as an ex officio member of all committees. Committee meetings shall be open to the public and shall comply with the requirements of this article and state law.

                  Purchasing office means the office designated and maintained pursuant to this article and the county administrator. 
                  (Code 1992, § 2-73; Ord. of 4-5-2010, § I) 
                  Sec. 2-85. - Purchases restricted. 
                  (a)  No officer or employee of the county shall purchase for or on behalf of the county any materials or supplies, goods, wares or merchandise of any kind or character or make any contract for materials or supplies or equipment or for services, except through the purchasing office. 
                  (b)  Purchases contrary to the method provided in subsection (a) of this section shall be deemed unauthorized purchases. The county will not be responsible for the payment of any bills submitted for unauthorized purchases.

                  (Code 1992, § 2-74; Ord. of 4-5-2010, § I) 
                  Sec. 2-86. - Purchase orders required; exceptions. 
                  No officer or employee of the county shall request any merchant, dealer or other vendor to deliver goods in an amount of $5,000.00 or greater to the county except on a purchase order from the purchasing office, except in the case of emergency purchases as provided in section 2-87. 
                  (Code 1992, § 2-75; Ord. of 4-5-2010, § I) 
                  Sec. 2-87. - Emergency purchases. 
                  (a)  Emergency purchases are those purchases made necessary by situations which could not be anticipated by the department or elected officials, usually involving life threatening circumstances or risks of injury, or resulting in work stoppages, or undue delay, or occurring during non-business hours when the ordinary purchase procedures cannot be followed. Negligence on the part of the department head or elected official to plan properly is not justification of an emergency purchase. 
                  (b)  If an emergency requiring a purchase occurs during business hours, the department head or elected official shall contact the purchasing office and obtain an emergency purchase order number. The item sought may then be acquired using that number. Such number will be stated to the vendor as evidence that the purchase has been approved and the number shall be noted on any vendor invoice for the item receiving emergency approval. If the emergency occurs during non-business hours, the department head or elected official may make the purchase and, immediately upon the resolution of the emergency, a requisition shall be prepared stating the nature of the emergency. The requisition shall be forwarded to the purchase office on the next business day. The requisition shall be accompanied by the purchase receipt and a memorandum from the department head or elected official setting forth the details of the emergency. 
                  (Code 1992, § 2-76; Ord. of 4-5-2010, § I) 
                  Sec. 2-88. - Open market purchases. 
                  Except in cases of emergency, no order shall be issued for the delivery on a contract or open market purchases until it has been determined that there exists a sufficient unencumbered appropriation balance for the budget line item to be charged. 
                  (Code 1992, § 2-77; Ord. of 4-5-2010, § I) 
                  Sec. 2-89. - Purchasing procedure. 
                  Where practicable, all county purchases and contract work shall be subject to fair and open bidding subject to state law, county ordinances and the following: 
                  (1)  State contract prices. Items that can be purchased from a published list of bid prices provided by the state or its agencies may be purchased in accordance with such bid list and contract prices without bids, subject to the accrual of revenue and availability of funds, which shall be confirmed and coordinated with the board of commissioners prior to purchase. 
                  (2)  Small purchases. Small purchases of less than $250.00 may be from suppliers and distributors in the ordinary course of business when such purchases are generally sold on a competitive basis. When several small purchases can be reasonably combined for non-monthly recurring purchases, then consideration shall be given to a pooled or bulk purchase subject to the bidding process. 
                  (3)  Special or custom items. Items of a specialized, unique or customized nature or origin, without more than one distributor in the county area, may be purchased at a price published in catalogues or trade journals or commonly known in the field of use, provided that if the value of such item exceeds $2,500.00 in cost, then the board of commissioners may require advertisement of such purchase. 
                  (4)  Purchases between $250.00 and $2,500.00. For items sold by more than one distributor, at least two sources shall be contacted and a cost estimate obtained from each of the items costing up to $2,500.00. 
                  (5)  Purchases between $2,500.00 and $10,000.00. All purchases and contracts having an estimated cost between $2,500.00 and $10,000.00 may be subject to bids with at least two suppliers or contractors submitting bids in writing, except as follows: 
                  a.  Bulk gas purchases may be subject to oral solicitation on a regular monthly basis, provided the bidders and amounts of bids are noted in writing. 
                  b.  Items covered by other provisions of this article or law. 
                  c.  Where otherwise requested by the board of commissioners. 
                  (6)  Purchases and contracts over $10,000.00. Unless otherwise provided in this article, all purchases and contracts estimated to cost $10,000.00 or more, except public works contracts and materials, may be subject to a written sealed bid after advertisement in the official organ of the county at least 15 days prior to the bid opening date. Subject to prior notice and approval by the board of commissioners, used equipment and property may be purchased, without advertisement, provided that the department head has made a diligent search of the market place and provides documentation of such search. Documentation shall include information as to the cost of such equipment if new, its availability, warranty, expected life, proposed use, etc. 
                  (7)  Bulk purchases. When items to be purchased are also used by other county departments and can be reasonably purchased in bulk with other county departments, then such departments shall coordinate such purchases with each other and with the purchasing office to promote the most economical purchase price and to minimize the number of transactions involved. 
                  (8)  Inventory. All purchases resulting in a fixed asset (vehicle, equipment, furnishings, etc.) with a value of over $500.00 shall be properly inventoried and documented by the department head. The department head shall be responsible for affixing the bar code sticker to the fixed asset. Each department head shall review the department's inventory for additions and deletions. 
                  (9)  Local vendors. Except for matters required to be bid by state law, including, without limitation, public works contracts and materials, any purchase or contract of under $100,000.00 that is put out to bid under the provisions of this article shall be awarded to a local vendor in the case of equivalent bids. In cases in which a bid by a local vendor is within five percent of the lowest overall bid supplied by a non-local vendor, the administration of the county is authorized to negotiate with such local bidder to match the lowest bid supplied by a non-local vendor. Negotiation is limited to purchases and contracts up to $100,000.00 and is not authorized in situations where state or federal laws do not allow vendor preferences. If a local bidder matches the lowest bid, including all other terms and conditions of the bid, then the local vendor will be awarded the contract. If the bids of more than one local vendor are within five percent of the lowest overall bid of a non-local vendor, the local vendor with the lowest bid price will be given the first opportunity to match the lowest overall bid. If this local vendor declines to match such bid, then the vendor with the next lowest bid within five percent will be given the opportunity to match the lowest bid. This process will continue with all local vendors having bids within five percent of the lowest overall bid by a non-local vendor. 
                  (10)  Indebted vendors. No bid shall be accepted nor any purchase made through any local or non-local vendor which owes real or personal, state, county, or school district ad valorem taxes to the county at the time of such sale. 
                  (Code 1992, § 2-78; Ord. of 4-5-2010, § I) 
                  Sec. 2-90. - Procedures for purchases and contracting. 
                  All purchasing and contracting shall be in accordance with this article and state law, and the following: 
                  (1)  A request or notice of purchase, in accordance with the approved budget, shall be submitted in writing by the department head to the purchasing office of the board of commissioners at least one week prior to the proposed purchase or need for payment. The county administrator, board of commissioners or its chairperson may request additional information prior to a decision on such matter. 
                  (2)  The notice or request for purchase shall contain information about the proposed purchase or contract including the name and purpose of the item, the estimated cost, the method of bidding suggested for the purchase requested and the funding line item source. 
                  (3)  In the case of bulk purchases or multiple departments involvement, then a spokesperson or coordinator from such departments shall be designated by the departments subject to approval of the board of commissioners, and such spokesperson or designee shall coordinate such purchases with the county administrator or board of commissioners. 
                  (4)  Depending on the size and nature of the purchase, and other applicable ordinances and policies, the county administrator, after conferring with the chairperson, may authorize the purchase. Otherwise, such purchase shall be referred to the board of commissioners for information and/or decision. 
                  (5)  All county contracts must be signed by the county administrator. 
                  (Code 1992, § 2-79; Ord. of 4-5-2010, § I) 
                  Sec. 2-91. - Schedule of purchases and contracts. 
                  Where reasonably practical, all equipment and capital purchases shall be made on a periodic scheduled basis rather than all at one time. To avoid excessive demand on county revenue, the equipment and capital purchases shall be broken down and purchased over the term of the entire fiscal year. Bulk equipment purchases shall be scheduled so that no more than approximately one-fourth of bulk equipment purchases shall be made within a single quarter. The board of commissioners may specify with any budgeted item or personnel a time for such purchase or employment. 
                  (Code 1992, § 2-80; Ord. of 4-5-2010, § I) 
                  Sec. 2-92. - Approved vendors. 
                  (a)  The purchasing office shall maintain a file of all qualified vendors who desire to do business with the county, which file shall be maintained according to the nature of goods and materials offered and shall contain a description of the vendors' goods and services. 
                  (b)  Purchases on behalf of the county shall be made only from the list of approved vendors. 
                  (Code 1992, § 2-81; Ord. of 4-5-2010, § I) 
                  Sec. 2-93. - Discretion for certain purchases. 
                  The purchasing office shall exercise discretion in making purchases where quality as well as price and service are factors for consideration. In circumstances in which brand name items are requisitioned by any department or official, the purchasing office has the authority to determine whether similar products of equal quality are available to the county at a lower price.

                  Sec. 8-107. - Contractors' responsibilities. 
                  It shall be the duty of every contractor who shall make a contract for the installation of a building, structure or electrical, gas, mechanical, sprinkler or plumbing system for which a permit is required to comply with state or local rules and regulations concerning licensing which the applicable governing authority may have adopted. Where the state requires a contractor to obtain a state license before they are permitted to perform work, the contractor shall supply the local government with his license number before receiving a permit for work to be performed.

                  (a)  Issuance construed to be license to proceed; commencing of work; extension of time. A permit issued shall be construed to be a license to proceed with the work and not an authority to violate, cancel, alter or set aside any of the provisions of the technical codes, nor shall issuance of a permit prevent a building inspector from thereafter requiring a correction of errors in plans, construction or violations of this division. Every permit issued shall become invalid unless the work authorized by such permit is commenced within six months after its issuance, or if the work authorized by such permit is suspended or abandoned for a period of six months after the time the work is commenced. One or more extensions of time, for periods of not more than 90 days each, may be allowed for the permit. The extension shall be requested in writing and justifiable cause demonstrated. Extensions shall be in writing by the building inspector. 
                  (b)  Issuance on basis of an affidavit. Whenever a permit is issued in reliance upon an affidavit or the work to be covered by a permit involves installation under conditions which, in the opinion of the building inspector, are hazardous or complex, the building inspector shall require that the architect or engineer who signed the affidavit or prepared the drawings or compilations shall supervise such work. In addition, such architect or engineer shall be responsible for conformity with the permit, provide copies of inspection reports as inspections are performed, and, upon completion, make and file a written affidavit with the building inspector that the work has been done in conformity with the reviewed plans and the structural provisions of the technical codes. 
                  (c)  Reviewed drawings. When the building inspector issues a permit, he shall endorse, in writing or by stamp, on both sets of plans, "Reviewed for Code Compliance." One set of such reviewed drawings shall be retained by the building inspector and the other set shall be returned to the applicant. The permitted drawings shall be kept at the site of the work and shall be open to inspection by the building inspector or his authorized representative.

                  (b)  When due. On buildings, structures or electrical, plumbing, mechanical and gas systems, a fee for each permit shall be paid, as required, at the time of filing of the application, in accordance with the fee schedule as set by county ordinance. 
                  (c)  Building permit valuations. In the opinion of the building inspector, if the valuation of a building, alteration, structure or electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing system appears to be underestimated on the application, the permit shall not be issued until the applicant can show detailed estimates to meet the approval of the building inspector. Permit valuation shall include the total cost, such as electrical, gas, mechanical, plumbing equipment and other systems, including materials and labor. 
                  (d)  Refunds. The building inspector may authorize refunding of any fee which was erroneously paid or collected under this section. The building inspector may authorize refunding of not more than 80 percent of the permit fee when no work has been done under a permit issued in accordance with the technical codes. The building inspector shall not authorize refunding of any permit fee paid except upon written application filed by the original applicant not later than 180 days after the date of the fee payment.

Any appellant may represent himself or be represented by counsel or any other agent or person. The board may continue a hearing which has been commenced for the purpose of presentation of additional evidence or making further study or investigation of its own. The board shall cause a tape recording to be made of its proceedings on any appeal.

The decision shall be dated, and a copy shall be transmitted to the appellant by certified mail, a copy delivered to the director, and a copy retained by the secretary in the permanent records of the board. The decision of the board shall be final, except that a majority of the members of the board who were within the majority of the board who voted in favor of the decision may move to reconsider the decision at any meeting of the board held not later than 30 days after the date of the decision. When any matter is presented to the board for reconsideration, the chairperson may determine whether to permit non-board members to make any statement or other presentation. Upon the adoption of a vote to reconsider, the members of the board in attendance at the meeting at which the reconsideration is adopted may move to reverse, modify or affirm the decision, or schedule a subsequent hearing to permit the appellant, the director and other interested persons to present additional evidence.

The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful."

Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. The public officer and governing authority are relieved of any and all liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials. 
                  (i)  The amount of the cost of demolition, including, all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the tax commissioner, and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, including restoration to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred.

                  (k)  Upon final determination of costs, fees, and expenses incurred in accordance with this section, the public officer responsible for enforcement actions in accordance with this article shall transmit to the county tax commissioner a statement of the total amount due and secured by said lien, together with copies of all notices provided to interested parties. The statement of the public officer shall be transmitted within 90 days of completion of the repairs, demolition or closure. 
                  (l)  The unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties from and after the date of final determination of costs in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes. An enforcement proceeding pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 for delinquent ad valorem taxes may include all amounts due under this article. 
                  (m)  The redemption amount in any enforcement proceeding pursuant to this section shall be the full amount of the costs as finally determined in accordance with this section together with interest, penalties, and costs incurred by the county tax commissioner in the enforcement of such lien. Redemption of property from the lien may be made in accordance with the provisions of O.C.G.A. §§ 48-4-80 and 48-4-81. 
                  (n)  The governing authority may waive and release any such lien imposed on the property upon the owner of such property entering into a contract with the county agreeing to a timetable for rehabilitation of the real property or the dwelling, building, or structure on the property and demonstrating the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation.

                  Sec. 10-42. - Adult entertainment establishment; findings; public purpose. 
                  (a)  Based on the experiences of other urban counties and municipalities, including, but not limited to, Atlanta, College Park, Carrollton, and Whitfield County, Georgia, which experiences are relevant to the problems faced by the county, the commissioners take note of the well-known and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable counties in the state. 
                  (b)  Moreover, it is the finding of the commissioners that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in so-called "nude bars" or establishments offering so-called "nude entertainment" or "adult entertainment," leads to an increase in the surrounding area of criminal behavior and creates undesirable community conditions, blight and diminution in property values. In the same manner, establishments offering photographic adult entertainment have the same deleterious effects on the county. 
                  (c)  Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, live commercial nudity in general, and photographic adult entertainment are disorderly conduct, prostitution, solicitation, drug trafficking, drug use and corruption of public officials. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, commercial nudity in general, and photographic adult entertainment are depression of property values and acceleration of community blight in the surrounding neighborhoods, increased allocation of and expenditure for law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, and increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described. 
                  (d)  Furthermore, it is the finding of the county commissioners that other forms of adult entertainment, including, but not limited to, adult bookstores, peep shows, adult theaters and massage parlors, have a deleterious effect upon the quality of life in neighborhoods, commercial districts and urban life in general. 
                  (e)  Accordingly, it is in the best interests of the health, welfare, safety and morals of the county to reduce the adverse impact of adult entertainment facilities by limiting the number of such uses, so as to reduce the negative impacts of adult entertainment facilities or adult uses upon other business uses, neighborhood property values, residential areas and public and semi-public uses; to ensure that adult uses and adult entertainment facilities do not impede development, redevelopment and neighborhood revitalization efforts; and to avoid allowing adult entertainment and adult uses in heavily used public pedestrian areas. 
                  (f)  Therefore, the limitation of adult uses and adult entertainment to certain prescribed areas of the county is in the public welfare and it is a matter of governmental interest and concern to minimize the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which provide or establish adult entertainment or adult uses. To that end, this article is hereby adopted.

                  Sec. 10-68. - Short title. 
                  This division shall be known as the Wayne County Pawnshops and Pawnbrokers Ordinance. 
                  (Code 1992, § 10-40; Ord. of 7-6-2015, § 1) 
                  Sec. 10-69. - Findings and intent. 
                  (a)  This division is adopted to address and promote the interests of public safety, health and welfare of the county and its citizens, to aid and assist in the recovery of stolen property, to aid and assist local law enforcement in fulfilling its public safety functions, and to facilitate peaceful, lawful, orderly and efficient pawn brokering within the county. 
                  (b)  The county recognizes that pawnshops or pawnbrokers are legitimate businesses authorized by or otherwise permitted under state law. However, the county finds that the services offered by such forms of business may provide an opportunity for individuals to potentially transfer stolen property to those businesses. The county also finds that consumer protection regulation is warranted in transactions involving these businesses. The county further finds that the various pawn transactions of pawnshops or pawnbrokers have expanded beyond the county's current ability to effectively or efficiently identify criminal activity related to them. The purpose of the county's regulation of pawnshops or pawnbrokers is to prevent such forms of business from being used to facilitate the commission of crimes and also to ensure that they comply with basic consumer protection standards, thereby protecting the public health, safety and general welfare of citizens, pursuant to authority granted to the county by state law and the constitution of the state.

                  Employee means any person who works in a pawnshop or for a pawnbroker's shop or establishment, whether on a part-time or full-time basis, regardless of whether remuneration is received or is not, and whether classified as an employee or independent contractor for taxation purposes. 
                  Month means that period of time from one date in a calendar month to the corresponding date in the following calendar month, but, if there is no such corresponding date, then the last day of such following month. 
                  Pawn transaction means any loan on the security of pledged goods or any purchase of pledged goods on the condition that the pledged goods may be redeemed or repurchased by the pledger or seller for a fixed price within a fixed period of time. 
                  Pawnbroker means any person engaged in whole or in part in the business of lending money on the security of pledged goods, or in the business of purchasing tangible personal property on the condition that it may be redeemed or repurchased by the seller for a fixed price within a fixed period of time, or in the business of purchasing tangible personal property from persons or sources other than manufacturers or licensed or permitted dealers as a part of or in conjunction with the business activities described in this definition. 
                  Pledged goods means tangible personal property, including, without limitation, all types of motor vehicles or any motor vehicle certificate of title, which such property is purchased by, deposited with, or otherwise actually delivered into the possession of a pawnbroker or a pawnshop in connection with a pawn transaction. However, for purposes of this division, possession of any motor vehicle certificate of title which has come into the possession of a pawnbroker or a pawnshop through a pawn transaction made in accordance with applicable law shall be conclusively deemed to be possession of the motor vehicle, and the pawnbroker or the pawnshop may retain physical possession of the motor vehicle certificate of title for the entire length of the pawn transaction, but shall not be required in any way to retain physical possession of the motor vehicle at any time. Pledged goods shall not include choses in action, securities, or printed evidences of indebtedness. 
                  Sheriff means the Wayne County Sheriff or any of his lawful deputies.

If the criminal investigation shows that the applicant meets the requirements set by this division and all other requirements of this division are satisfied, then the county administrator shall schedule the application for hearing at the next regularly-scheduled public meeting of the county commissioners, and shall so inform the applicant of this fact before such meeting. If the criminal investigation report shows that the applicant fails to meet the requirements set by this division, or if the applicant fails to meet all other requirements outlined by this division, then the county administrator shall inform the applicant, in writing, that the application has been denied, and shall set forth in reasonable detail the reasons for the denial, and shall notify the applicant of his right to appeal.

The identity of the agent may also be submitted contemporaneously with the filing of the license or permit application. 
                  (j)  Upon approval by the county commissioners of the application for a license or permit, the county clerk shall issue a license or permit in accordance with the approved application.

                  Hazardous waste means any solid waste which has been defined as a hazardous waste in regulations promulgated by the administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) pursuant to the Federal Act, which are in force and effect on February 1, 1988, codified as 40 CFR 261, and as amended. 
                  Lot means the contiguous land in the same ownership which is not divided by any public highway or alley, including any part thereof subject to any easement for any purpose other than a public highway or alley, but excluding any part thereof severed from another lot where the severance creates any nonconformity of size or use. 
                  Perennial river/stream means a river/stream or section of a river/stream that normally flows continuously throughout the whole year. 
                  Protected river corridor means all land, inclusive of islands, in areas of a protected river within a distance of 100 feet horizontally on both sides of the river, measured from the uppermost part of the river bank. The area between the top of the bank and the edge of the water is included in the protected area. 
                  River/stream bank means the rising ground, bordering a river or a stream, which serves to confine the water to the natural channel during the normal course of flow. 
                  Subdivision means all divisions of a tract or parcel of land into two or more lots, building sites, or other divisions for the purpose of sale, legacy, or building development, whether immediate or future. The term "subdivision" shall include all divisions or re-subdivisions of land involving a new road or change in existing roads. Excluded from this definition is the combination or recombination of portions of previously platted lots where the total number of lots is not increased. 
                  Utility means public or private water or sewer piping systems, water or sewer pumping stations, electric power lines, fuel pipelines, telephone lines, roads, driveways, bridges, river/lake access facilities, stormwater systems and railroads or other utilities identified by a local government. 
                  Wetlands means those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas. The ecological parameters for designating wetlands include hydric soils, hydrological vegetation, and hydrological conditions that involve a temporary or permanent source of water to cause soil saturation. 
                  (Code 1992, § 16-53; Ord. of 10-19-2000, § 3) 
                  Sec. 16-22. - General provisions. 
                  (a)  Permit required. No building, mobile home, structure, or land within the jurisdiction of the county board of commissioners shall hereafter be erected, constructed, located, moved, used, subdivided, altered or disturbed except in conformity with the regulations herein and without first obtaining a permit from the county board of health. This provision does and shall apply to the location of all manufactured housing and industrialized buildings in the county. 
                  (b)  Minimum lot size. All lots intended for residential or other use within the county shall be of such size as necessary to meet all requirements, rules, and regulations of the state department of human resources according to the Rules of the Georgia Department of Human Resources and Public Health for On-Site Sewage Management Systems Manual; and as necessary to comply with the minimums set forth in the Tables MT-1 and MT-2 hereby attached to and made a part of this article as Appendix 1, if on-site sewage management is utilized, and/or this article, whichever is stricter. 
                  (c)  On-site sewage management permit required. No person or business shall construct an on-site sewage management system on any lot within the county until site approval and an on-site sewage management construction permit has been obtained from and issued by the county health department. 
                  (d)  Permit coordination. The required permit under subsection (a) of this section shall not be issued until the county health department issues an on-site sewage management construction permit or a site approval letter, whichever is appropriate, so that all lots proposed to be used or subdivided would satisfy the requirements of this article, including the Rules of Georgia Department of Human Resources for On-Site Sewage Management Systems. If the county health department is delegated the responsibility for administering this article, the permit or letter under this subsection shall suffice as the permit required under subsection (a) of this section. 
                  (e)  Requirements are minimum. The regulations and requirements set by this article shall be the minimum requirements. 
                  (f)  Compliance with state and federal regulations. All developments, structures, and uses within the county shall also meet the requirements of all other local, federal and state regulations in effect, including, but not limited to, department of transportation regulations, state fire marshal regulations, Georgia's Uniform Construction Codes, and state department of natural resources and state environmental protection division environmental rules and regulations. Issuance of a permit under this article does not constitute certification of compliance with such codes or regulations, and does not abrogate responsibility of the owner to so comply. 
                  (g)  Map interpretation. If there is an uncertainty as to where a lot, portion of a lot, or a proposed construction or location impacts an environmental resource regulated by this article because of interpretation of the applicable map, the decision of the county board of commissioners, or the county health department if it is delegated the responsibility for administering this article, shall take precedent and be considered correct and final, but may be appealed as set forth in subsection (h) of this section. 
                  (h)  Map appeal. Any person who feels aggrieved by a decision of the county board of commissioners or the county health department, as appropriate, regarding map interpretation may, at his own expense, request reconsideration. Such reconsideration shall include submission of scientific evidence for reversal of the alleged error in map interpretation, and such evidence must be documented by a state-registered engineer, geologist, or soil scientist. To obtain a reversal of the decision of map interpretation, the evidence must be acceptable to the state department of natural resources' environmental protection division, and the county board of commissioners, and/or the county health department, if the county health department is delegated responsibility for administering this article. Any costs for submission of evidence to the state department of natural resources' environmental protection division shall be borne by the person requesting reconsideration. 
                  (i)  Coordination with zoning and other regulations. This article shall be coordinated with any zoning or other regulations adopted by the county board of commissioners, and if there is any conflict with those zoning or other regulations, the stricter provisions shall apply. If zoning is or has been adopted, the provisions of this article shall be considered an overlay, or additional requirement to the requirements of underlying zoning regulations and districts. 
                  (j)  Fees. Any fees for applications, inspections, and the issuance of permits or certificates required or issued under the provisions of this article shall be paid by the person seeking such permit at the time of application in advance of the issuance of such permits or certificates. The amount of such fees, if any, shall be those established by the county board of commissioners from time to time. 
                  (Code 1992, § 16-54; Ord. of 10-19-2000, § 4) 
                  Sec. 16-23. - Delegation of ordinance administration. 
                  The county board of commissioners, because of the need for coordination, hereby charges the county health department with responsibility for administering this article and ensuring compliance with its provisions. 
                  (Code 1992, § 16-55; Ord. of 10-19-2000, § 5) 
                  Sec. 16-24. - Wetlands protection regulations. 
                  (a)  Findings of fact. The wetlands within the county are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion and soil limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife, and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control, natural resource education; scientific study; open space; and recreational opportunities. 
                  (b)  Reference map. The official maps to be used as the determinant for location of wetlands in the county and to be regulated area under this article will be the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's National Wetlands Inventory Maps for Wayne County. These maps portray generalized wetlands inventory areas, and these wetlands inventory areas do not necessarily represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands under the authority of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and cannot serve as a substitute for a jurisdictional wetland determination or a wetland delineation by that agency. 
                  (c)  Wetlands development permit requirements. No activity or use except those identified in subsection (d) of this section shall be allowed within wetlands without a permit under this article. Activities or uses permitted under section 404 of the U.S. Clean Water Act may receive a local permit once any required federal permit, or if appropriate, letter of permission/determination, is obtained as described below, and any other applicable provisions of this article have been satisfied. 
                  (1)  If there is a determination in the administration of this article that a proposed activity, use, or development subject to permit herein would not be located in or near an identified wetlands inventory area and would not disturb an identified wetlands inventory area, no further action concerning this particular article section is necessary. 
                  (2)  If there is a determination in the administration of this article that a proposed activity, use, or development subject to permit herein may be located in or near an identified wetlands inventory area and might disturb wetlands which appear to be under the jurisdiction of section 404 of the U. S. Clean Water Act, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers jurisdictional wetlands determination shall be required prior to issuance of a permit under this article. 
                  (3)  If a U. S. Army Corps of Engineers jurisdictional wetlands determination is required, no local permit under this article will be issued until the person requesting the permit, at his own expense, obtains either a section 404 permit, if so required, or a letter of permission/determination from the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers that no federal permit is required. 
                  (4)  No action in the administration of this article and no local permit issued pursuant to this article relieves the landowner from any federal or state permitting requirements, including those relating to wetlands or land disturbance. 
                  (d)  Permitted uses not requiring a permit. The following uses are permitted without a permit within the wetlands of the county to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law, and provided that they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining, or dredging except as provided herein: 
                  (1)  Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the state forestry commission (section 404 does not require permits for normal, ongoing silvicultural activities. However, section 404 does list some required road construction best management practices that must be followed in order to qualify for such an exemption). 
                  (2)  Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish, or other wildlife, provided they do not affect waters of the state or of the United States in such a way that would require a section 404 permit. 
                  (3)  Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding, and canoeing. 
                  (4)  Natural water quality treatment or purification. 
                  (5)  Normal agriculture activities including the planting and harvesting of crops and pasturing of livestock. Such activities shall be subject to best management practices approved by the state department of agriculture. 
                  (e)  Prohibited uses. In compliance with the state rules for environmental planning criteria, the following uses are prohibited entirely, and no permit shall be issued for them: 
                  (1)  Receiving areas for toxic or hazardous waste or other contaminants. 
                  (2)  Hazardous or sanitary waste landfills. 
                  (Code 1992, § 16-56; Ord. of 10-19-2000, § 6) 
                  Sec. 16-25. - Groundwater recharge areas protection regulations. 
                  (a)  Findings of fact. Recharge areas are vulnerable to urban development activities as well as agricultural activities. Pesticides and herbicides sprayed on crops and animal waste, like septic tank effluents, contribute to a deterioration in the groundwater quality and can threaten the health of residents relying on well water. Development usually means an increase in the amount of land covered with impervious surfaces. Paving land in recharge areas can alter or impair their recharge characteristics, thereby decreasing groundwater supplies. 
                  (b)  Reference map. The official map for delineation of significant groundwater recharge areas in the county to be regulated areas under this article is the state department of natural resources' Significant Recharge Areas, Hydrological Atlas 18 (1989 edition). 
                  (c)  Groundwater recharge areas development permit requirements. All uses except those identified in subsection (d) of this section and those subject to further restriction by any underlying zoning district area allowed. The following are additional requirements for specific uses: 
                  (1)  All new above-ground chemical or petroleum storage tanks, having a minimum volume of 660 gallons, shall have secondary containment for 110 percent of the volume of such tanks or 110 percent of the volume of the largest tank in a cluster of tanks, and shall otherwise meet the requirements of U.S. EPA rules for oil pollution prevention, 40 CFR 112.1. Such tanks used for agricultural purposes are exempt, provided they comply with all federal regulations. 
                  (2)  All single-family dwellings, multifamily dwellings, mobile home parks, or other uses located within a groundwater recharge area and not served by both public water and sewer systems shall be required to have 150 percent of the minimum lot or space size calculated based on applications of the state department of human resources Manual for On-Site Sewage Management Systems (DHR manual) Tables MT-1 and MT-2 (included as part of this article in Appendix 1). The minimums set forth in Tables MT-1 and MT-2 may be increased further based on consideration of other factors (set forth in sections A through F of the DHR manual). Said minimum lot size shall not be in any case less than the minimum lot size specified by any underlying zoning district. The regulations specifying the largest minimum lot size shall apply. 
                  (3)  All lots shall have a minimum width of 150 feet, or as specified in any underlying zoning district if stricter (larger), in the area where an approved on-site sewage management system is to be located. 
                  (4)  No construction may proceed on a building or mobile home to be served by a septic tank or other on-site sewage management system unless the county health department first approves the proposed on-site sewage management system installation as meeting the requirements of the state department of human resources' Manual for On-Site Sewage Management Systems and the provisions of this article. 
                  (5)  All new wastewater treatment basins shall have an impermeable liner, except for the construction of mining settling basins. 
                  (6)  All new agricultural waste impoundment sites shall be lined. As a minimum, the liner shall be constructed of compact clay having a thickness of one foot and a vertical hydraulic conductivity of less than five by ten cm/sec or other criteria established by the U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service. 
                  (d)  Prohibited uses. The following uses are prohibited entirely and no permit shall be issued for them: 
                  (1)  All new hazardous waste storage, treatment and disposal facilities. 
                  (2)  New facilities handling 10,000 pounds or more of hazardous materials of the types listed in section 312 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as amended, excluding underground storage tanks, on any one day. 
                  (3)  Permanent stormwater infiltration basins. 
                  (Code 1992, § 16-57; Ord. of 10-19-2000, § 7) 
                  Sec. 16-26. - Major river corridor protection district regulations. 
                  (a)  Findings of fact. Perennial rivers or watercourses with an average annual flow of at least 400 cubic feet per second are of vital importance to the state in that they help preserve those qualities that make a river suitable for habitat for wildlife, a site for recreation, and a source for clean drinking water. These river corridors also allow the free movement of wildlife from area to area within the state, help control erosion and river sedimentation, and help absorb floodwaters. 
                  (b)  District delineation. Protected rivers as defined under the rules for environmental planning criteria, adopted by the state department of natural resources pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, includes any perennial rivers or watercourses with an average annual flow of at least 400 cubic feet per second. The Altamaha River and the Little Satilla River through the county meet this criteria. A protected river corridor and a protective 100-foot vegetation buffer is hereby established along the entire length of these rivers within the jurisdiction of the county board of commissioners. The buffer area is measured horizontally from each riverbank within the county jurisdiction. Under the method prescribed by the rules for environmental planning criteria, no development or other land disturbing activity will be allowed to occur within the protected river corridor and within a 100-foot buffer of the river bank, except for the following permitted uses. 
                  (c)  Permitted uses. No development or construction or other land disturbing activity will be allowed to occur within the 100-foot buffer from the protected river except for the following uses, and the natural vegetative buffer shall be restored as quickly as possible following any land disturbing activity or construction permitted within the river corridor for these acceptable uses: 
                  (1)  Single-family dwellings, if any underlying zoning district so permits, provided each dwelling is located on a lot with a minimum size as specified by the county health department or the underlying zoning district regulations, but shall be the greater of these requirements; however, in any case, the lot for each dwelling shall not be less than two acres, not including any area between the river banks; and provided the septic tank drainfield is located outside of the 100-foot buffer area. 
                  (2)  Any residential uses existing or under construction prior to the adoption of these local protection ordinances, provided the use has an on-site sewage management construction permit issued by the county health department prior to the date of adoption of these local protection ordinances. 
                  (3)  Any industrial or commercial uses existing prior to the adoption of these local protection ordinances, providing they do not impair the drinking quality of the river water as defined by the Federal Clean Water Act, as amended, and meet all other federal and state environmental regulations. 
                  (4)  Road and utility crossings, providing the construction of these crossings meets the requirements of the Georgia Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975 (O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.), as amended, or any local requirements, if stricter. 
                  (5)  Timber production and harvesting, providing it is consistent with the best management practices established by the state forestry commission, and does not impair the drinking quality of the river water as defined by the Federal Clean Water Act, as amended. 
                  (6)  Agricultural production and management, provided it is consistent with the best management practices established by the state soil and water conservation commission, and all other state and federal laws and regulations, including those promulgated by the state department of agriculture; and does not impair the drinking quality of the river water as defined by the Federal Clean Water Act, as amended. 
                  (7)  Wildlife and fisheries management activities consistent with the purposes of O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8 (as amended). 
                  (8)  Natural water quality treatment or purification. 
                  (9)  Wastewater treatment. 
                  (10)  Recreational usage consistent with the maintenance of a natural vegetative buffer or with river-dependent recreation. 
                  (d)  Prohibited uses. In compliance with the state rules for environmental planning criteria, the following uses are prohibited entirely and no permit shall be issued for them: 
                  (1)  Facilities or areas used for the handling, receiving, storing, or disposal of hazardous wastes. 
                  (2)  Hazardous or solid waste landfills. 
                  (3)  Septic tank drainfields within the 100-foot buffer area under any circumstance. 
                  (4)  Septic tanks within the 100-foot buffer area, except as expressly provided for single-family dwellings which are permitted under and comply with subsection (c)(1) of this section.

                  Sec. 16-27. - Variances. 
                  When, due to a particular hardship or extraordinary circumstance of the property involved which is not easily corrected, it is impractical for an owner or developer to comply with all of the requirements of this article, the county board of commissioners shall be authorized to vary such requirements (under its jurisdiction) only to such extent as to provide fairness to the owner or developer and as to not violate the intent and purposes of this article. Such variances shall only be granted in an official public meeting, and the reasons for granting them shall be entered into the minutes of the public meeting.

                  APPENDIX 1 - MINIMUM LOT SIZING FOR ON-SITE SEWAGE MANAGEMENT 
                  (a)  Minimum lot size requirements for these lots utilizing on-site management systems are as follows for single-family dwellings, including, but not limited to: manufactured or mobile homes, stick-built homes, modular homes, etc., and individual lots in subdivisions or mobile home lots located in areas other than commercial mobile home parks. Area requirements for multiple dwellings on a single recorded lot, where not prohibited by local zoning, must be provided in multiples of the following minimum lot sizes for each dwelling to be constructed on the recorded lot. See Table MT-1 as follows. These minimum lot size requirements in this table may be increased further based on consideration of other factors and requirements upon application of the state department of human resources Manual for On-Site Sewage Management (DHR manual), including those currently set forth in sections A through F of the DHR manual.

                  Sec. 18-1. - Definitions. 
                  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Accessory structure means a structure having minimal value and used for parking, storage and other non-habitable uses, such as garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, hay sheds and the like. 
                  Addition (to an existing building) means any walled and roofed expansion to the perimeter of a building in which the addition is connected by a common load-bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition, which is connected by a firewall or is separated by an independent perimeter load-bearing wall, shall be considered new construction. 
                  Appeal means a request for a review of the building inspector's interpretation of any provision of this chapter. 
                  Area of shallow flooding means a designated AO-zone or AH-zone on a community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to three feet, and/or where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. 
                  Area of special flood hazard is the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year.

                  Development means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavating, drilling operations, and storage of materials or equipment. 
                  Elevated building means a non-basement building built to have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area elevated above the ground level by means of fill, solid foundation perimeter walls, pilings, columns, piers, or shear walls adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a base flood event. 
                  Existing construction means, for the purposes of determining rates, structures for which the start of construction commenced before September 30, 1988. 
                  Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and final site grading, or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before February 6, 1990. 
                  Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed, including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads. 
                  Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
                  (1)  The overflow of inland or tidal waters; or

                  Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
                  Freeboard means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed. 
                  Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, adjacent to the proposed foundation of a building. 
                  Historic structure means any structure that is:

                  b.  Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs. 
                  Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement. An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage, in an area other than a basement, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of other provisions of this Code. 
                  Manufactured home means a building, transportable in one or more sections, built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and similar transportable structures placed on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer and intended to be improved property. 
                  Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
                  Mean sea level means the average height of the sea for all stages of the tide. It is used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain. For purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum to which base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are referenced. 
                  National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD), as corrected in 1929, is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
                  New construction means, for the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the start of construction commenced after September 30, 1988, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, the term "new construction" means structures for which the start of construction commenced after February 6, 1990, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
                  New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed after February 6, 1990. 
                  North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) has replaced the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 in existing and future FEMA flood modernization maps. 
                  Recreational vehicle means a vehicle which is:

                  Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure, such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. (Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure.) Note: accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance requirements. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, or a gas or liquid storage tank. 
                  Subdivision means the division of a single lot into two or more lots for the purpose of sale or development. 
                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
                  Substantial improvement. 
                  (1)  The term "substantial improvement" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the start of construction of the improvement. Note: The market value of the structure should be: 
                  a.  The appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement; or 
                  b.  In the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. The term "substantial improvement" includes structures which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
                  (2)  For the purposes of this definition, the term "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term "substantial improvement" does not, however, include: 
                  a.  Those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to ensure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project; or 
                  b.  Any alteration of an historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure. 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions means when the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this article, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. 
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  Sec. 18-2. - Authorization. 
                  Article IX, section II of the state constitution and O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a) have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the county board of commissioners does ordain as follows. 
                  (Code 1992, § 18-1; Ord. of 7-12-2010, art. 1, § A) 
                  Sec. 18-3. - Findings of fact. 
                  (a)  The flood hazard areas of the county are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (b)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
                  (Code 1992, § 18-2; Ord. of 7-12-2010, art. 1, § B) 
                  Sec. 18-4. - Statement of purpose. 
                  It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, are protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
                  (4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; 
                  (5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.

                  The objectives of this chapter are: 
                  (1)  To protect human life and health; 
                  (2)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
                  (3)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; 
                  (4)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
                  (5)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
                  (6)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; and 
                  (7)  To ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

                  ARTICLE III. - PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

                  Sec. 18-77. - General standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard, the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure; 
                  (2)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage; 
                  (3)  New construction or substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
                  (4)  Elevated buildings. All new construction or substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater. 
                  a.  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
                  1.  Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
                  2.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and 
                  3.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both directions. 
                  b.  So as not to violate the "lowest floor" criteria of this article, the unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area; and 
                  c.  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms. 
                  (5)  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding; 
                  (6)  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces; 
                  (7)  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system; 
                  (8)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters; 
                  (9)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding; and 
                  (10)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure, which is not compliant with the provisions of this chapter, shall be undertaken only if the nonconformity is not furthered, extended or replaced.

                  In all areas of special flood hazard, the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and/or substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and/or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 18-77(4), elevated buildings. 
                  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  (2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH zones may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in section 18-59(6). 
                  (3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles; where base flood elevation data are available. 
                  a.  All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on: 
                  1.  Individual lots or parcels; 
                  2.  New and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions; 
                  3.  Expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions; or 
                  4.  A site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as the result of a flood; 
                  must have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  b.  Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
                  1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or 
                  2.  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
                  c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (Reference section 18-77(6).) 
                  d.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
                  1.  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; 
                  2.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions); or 
                  3.  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for new construction, including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsections (3)a and c of this section. 
                  (4)  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 18-7 are areas designated as floodways. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted, however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
                  b.  Only if subsection (4)a of this section is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this article.

                  (b)  The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the building inspector in the enforcement or administration of this article. 
                  (c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the appeal board may appeal such decision to the superior court of the county, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1. 
                  (d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (g)  In reviewing such requests, the appeal board shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article. 
                  (h)  Conditions for variances: 
                  (1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
                  b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, or create a nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  (2)  The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction, therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor, and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (4)  The building inspector shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (i)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

                  (1)  The board shall approve the application and issue a certificate of appropriateness if it finds that the proposed material change in the appearance would not have a substantial adverse effect on the value of the historic property or the historic district. In making this determination, the board shall consider, in addition to any other pertinent factors, the historical and architectural value and significance, architectural style, general design arrangement, texture and material of the architectural features involved, and the relationship thereof to the exterior architectural style, and pertinent features of the other structures in the immediate neighborhood.

                  (2)  Failure of the board to act within said 45 days shall constitute approval, and no other evidence of approval shall be needed. 
                  (j)  Necessary actions to be taken by board upon rejection of application for certificate of appropriateness. 
                  (1)  In the event the board rejects an application, it shall state its reasons for doing so, and shall transmit a record of such actions and reasons, in writing, to the applicant.

                  (2)  In cases where the application covers a material change in the appearance of a structure which would require the issuance of a building permit, the rejection of the application for a certificate of appropriateness by the board shall be binding upon the building inspector or other administrative officer charged with issuing building permits, and, in such a case, no building permit shall be issued. 
                  (k)  Undue hardship. Where, by reason of unusual circumstances, the strict application of any provision of this article would result in the exceptional practical difficulty or undue hardship upon any owner of a specific property, the board, in passing upon applications, shall have the power to vary or modify strict adherence to said provisions, or to interpret the meaning of said provisions, so as to relieve such difficulty or hardship, provided such variances, modifications or interpretations shall remain in harmony with the general purposes and intent of said provisions, so that the architectural or historical integrity, or character of the property, shall be conserved and substantial justice done. In granting variances, the board may impose such reasonable and additional stipulations and conditions as will, in its judgment, best fulfill the purpose of this article. Any undue hardship shall not be a situation of the person's own making.

                  (a)  Ordinary maintenance or repair. Ordinary maintenance or repair of any exterior architectural or environmental feature in or on an historic property to correct deterioration, decay or damage, or to sustain the existing form, and that does not involve a material change in design, material or outer appearance thereof, does not require a certificate of appropriateness. 
                  (b)  Failure to provide ordinary maintenance or repair. Property owners of historic properties or properties within historic districts shall not allow their buildings to deteriorate by failing to provide ordinary maintenance or repair.

                  (2)  In the event the board determines a failure to provide ordinary maintenance or repair, the board will notify the owner of the property and set forth the steps which need to be taken to remedy the situation. The owner of such property will have 30 days in which to do this. 
                  (3)  In the event that the condition is not remedied in 30 days, the owner shall be punished as provided in section 20-26 and, at the discretion of the appropriate governing body, the board may perform such maintenance or repair as is necessary to prevent deterioration by neglect. The owner of the property shall be liable for the cost of such maintenance and repair performed by the board. 
                  (c)  Affirmation of existing building and zoning codes. Nothing in this article shall be construed as to exempt property owners from complying with existing city or county building and zoning codes, nor to prevent any property owner from making any use of his property not prohibited by other statutes, ordinances or regulations.

                  (a)  In addition to other requirements imposed under this article, no operator shall harvest or transport timber or pulpwood on or to a paved county road in the county without first providing a valid surety bond, executed by a surety corporation authorized to transact business in the state, or an irrevocable letter of credit issued by a bank or savings and loan association, as defined in O.C.G.A. § 7-1-4, in the amount of $5,000.00. 
                  (b)  Only one bond shall be required by an operator to satisfy the requirements of this section, regardless of the number of sites to be harvested. Said bond shall remain in effect so long as timber or pulpwood harvesting operations are being conducted in the county. A valid replacement bond must be obtained and delivered to the board of commissioners or its designated agent no later than the close of business on the fifth business day following the day that the board of commissioners filed a claim to recover damages against the then-existing bond. Upon filing such claim, such governing authority shall immediately provide notice thereof, including the date such claim was filed, to the person or firm causing the damage.

Where damage does occur, the paved or dirt county roads so damaged shall be restored to their previous condition, including, but not limited to, removal of debris and mud and replacement of gravel. Trucks or other equipment used in the harvesting operation shall not be allowed to park on the public right-of-way. If timber is to be transported from the harvesting site onto a county road, the operator must provide the necessary materials and equipment to protect county property by means that meet forestry best management practices. The county will provide soil to the operator to improve entrances to county roads, when available. This material must be removed and the property restored to its original condition following the completion of the harvesting activities. 
                  (b)  Signs. To alert motorists, an operator harvesting and transporting timber or pulpwood on a county road shall post at least one sign in each direction at the site entrance. Unless otherwise designated by the county road superintendent, these signs shall be placed in locations visible to oncoming traffic, between 500 and 1,000 feet on either side of the road entrance. Each sign shall be triangular in shape, orange in color, with minimum dimensions of 18 inches by 24 inches, with four-inch lettering, and shall read "Caution: Log Trucks Entering Highway." The operator must furnish these signs at his own expense. 
                  (c)  Inspection by county road superintendent. Upon completion of harvesting activities at a site, the operator shall immediately notify the county road superintendent, who shall make an inspection of the site and the county road system affected by the harvesting-related activities. This inspection shall take place within three business days of receipt of said notice. The county emergency management director shall have the authority to close the county road or right-of-way, in the event it is determined necessary after the inspection by the county road superintendent. 
                  (d)  Inspection finding no damage. If the inspection required by subsection (c) of this section results in a finding that no damage occurred, the county road superintendent shall immediately so notify the operator. The bond shall be released if the operator is ceasing all harvesting operations in the county. 
                  (e)  Inspection finding damage. If the inspection required by subsection (c) of this section results in a finding that damage has occurred, the operator having caused the damage shall immediately undertake the repairs necessary to return the county road or right-of-way to its original condition. If there is disagreement with the county road superintendent's assessment that damage has occurred, the operator may appeal the decision of the county road superintendent to the county administrator. An adverse decision of the county administrator may subsequently be appealed by the operator to the county governing authority. 
                  (f)  Repairs by county. In the event no appeal is filed and the responsible operator has not effectuated the repairs, the county road superintendent shall be authorized to use county labor, equipment, and materials to complete the necessary repairs to the county road system. In such event, the county shall be authorized to forfeit the operator's bond in an amount necessary to reimburse the county for all expenses incurred. 
                  (g)  Operation after damages. The operator will not be allowed to operate in the county after the inspection finding damages as outlined in subsection (c) of this section is completed, until the operator has made and completed the required repairs to the satisfaction of the county road superintendent.

                  (a)  The county sheriff, county road superintendent, or other enforcement officer duly appointed by the county governing authority shall enforce this article. 
                  (b)  Each day that an operator continues timber or pulpwood harvesting operations without a permit constitutes a separate violation. 
                  (c)  Any operator violating this article shall be tried before the magistrate court of the county. Upon conviction, a violation of this article shall result in punishment by a fine of not less than $50.00 nor more than $$500.00. 
                  (d)  The director of the state forestry commission shall be notified as to any violations of this article.

The recordation of such statement shall constitute a lien on the personal and real property of the person to be charged, and shall remain in full force and effect until final payment is received in full, including accrued interest from the date of recording and any and all costs. Such amount as shall constitute final payment shall be subject to collection in the manner fixed by law for the collection of taxes. 
                  (f)  In the event that waste or hazardous materials in a dump site cannot be removed from public or private property without causing further endangerment to the environment and/or public health, whether legal or illegal, caused with intent or by accident, acts of God or forces of nature, or where a permit for such long-term or permanent disposal has been issued by the proper authority as defined in section 30-80, the county may attach or otherwise affix a permanent addendum to the deed of real property wherein the dump site exists, stating the approximate size and location of the dump on the property and an approximate description of the materials contained therein, as well as the approximate dates such dumping occurred, to be recorded on the property plat as a fill area (O.C.G.A. § 12-8-30).

                  ARTICLE IV. - PROCEDURE FOR PLAT APPROVAL 

                  Sec. 32-80. - Two-step review. 
                  The procedure for review, consideration, and approval of a subdivision plat consists of two separate steps. These are: 
                  (1)  Review of the preliminary plat by the building inspector and county engineer. 
                  (2)  Review of the final plat by the building inspector and county engineer and approval by county commissioners. 
                  (Code 1992, § 30-51; Ord. of 6-4-2007, § 4.1) 
                  Sec. 32-81. - Review procedure. 
                  The following procedure shall be followed in the submission, review, and action upon all subdivision plats: 
                  (1)  Preliminary plat procedures. 
                  a.  Application for preliminary approval of a subdivision plat shall be submitted to the building inspector. The plat of the subdivision shall be submitted in five prints and shall be such as to meet the minimum requirements contained herein. Any preliminary plat submitted to the building inspector office shall contain the name, telephone number, and address of the subdivider (or the subdivider's designee), and no preliminary plat shall be approved by the building inspector without full compliance with the requirements of this article. Actions by the building inspector may be appealed to the county administrator. Notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be sent by registered or certified mail to the subdivider or designee, to the address listed on the plat, not less than five days before the hearing date fixed. Appeals from a decision of the administrator shall be heard by the county commissioners, with the same notice of hearing provided. All appeals must be filed within 30 days of the date on which the action being appealed was taken. 
                  b.  Additional copies of the plat and supplemental information may be requested by the building inspector. The above-mentioned copies shall be distributed as required and additionally as deemed necessary by the building inspector. The person or agency to which a copy of the preliminary plat is directed shall indicate any desired changes or comments on the plat and submit the plat to the building inspector prior to formal approval of the preliminary plat. 
                  c.  The building inspector shall act on the preliminary plat within 30 days after formal submission, and, if approved, shall indicate in writing, stating the conditions of such approval, if any, or if disapproved, shall express in writing his disapproval and the reasons therefor. Failure of the building inspector to act within 30 days after formal submission of the preliminary plat shall be deemed to constitute approval, and a certificate to that effect shall be issued by the building inspector on demand; provided, however, that the subdivider may waive this requirement and consent in writing to the extension of such period. 
                  d.  Preliminary approval of the subdivision plat shall be noted on the plat and certified by the building inspector. Also noted shall be the date on which the building inspector granted preliminary approval and the date of written notification to the subdivider or the subdivider's authorized agent. Failure of a subdivider to initiate any development within 18 months from the approval of the preliminary plat will require resubmittal of a plat plan to the building inspector for approval, unless an extension is requested by the subdivider and approved by the building inspector. 
                  e.  Approval of a preliminary subdivision plat shall not constitute approval of the final subdivision plat. Preliminary approval shall constitute approval of the proposed widths and alignments of streets and the dimensions and shapes of lots subject to the final approval of the county health department. Application for approval of the final record plat will be considered only after the requirements for final plat approval as specified herein have been fulfilled and after all other specified conditions have been met. Upon approval of the preliminary subdivision plat by the building inspector, the subdivider may proceed to comply with the other requirements of these regulations and the preparation of the final subdivision plat. 
                  (2)  Final plat procedure. Application for final approval of the subdivision plat shall be submitted to the building inspector after approval of the preliminary plat. Ten copies of the final plat are required. The building inspector shall examine the final plat to determine if it meets all requirements of these regulations, if it conforms to the approved preliminary plat, and whether all required improvements as set forth in article VI of this chapter have been completed. Within 30 days of such final plat being submitted, the building inspector shall recommend approval or require the subdivider to make necessary modifications to conform to the standards required by the final plat. Upon recommendation of final approval by the building inspector, the county commissioners shall discuss and/or grant final approval of the subdivision plat. Actions of the building inspector and decisions may be appealed under the same procedure as outlined in subsection (1) of this section. If approved by the commissioners, a plat can be recorded in the office of the clerk of the county superior court upon meeting all requirements of article VI of this chapter and authentication by the county commissioners. For purposes hereof, authentication shall be in the following form, to wit: Approved for recording on the ____________ day of ____________ / ____________ / ____________ , 20 ____________ , by the chairperson of county commissioners.

                  (13)  ROW* (polygon): all existing and new road and drainage right-of-way areas, located either inside or adjacent to the subdivision (on file). 
                  (14)  ROW ANNO - (annotation): all existing and new street names and right-of-way widths. 
                  (15)  SUBDIV* (polygon): subdivision boundary areas (on file). 
                  (16)  SURVEY ANNO - (annotation): all survey data (bearings, distances, curve data, tie lines, etc.).

                  Note: In AutoCAD, island areas such as the one created by the example right-of-way in Figure G would be created by three or more polylines. Multiple polylines do not translate to one polygon in ArcGIS. In order to create a correct polygon of the right-of-way, it is necessary to make an AutoCAD block of all the associated right-of-way polylines. Any deviation from this standard will have to have prior approval from the county/city engineer or his appointee.

                  ARTICLE VI. - REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS 

                  Sec. 32-137. - Enumerated. 
                  (a)  Subdivider provision prior to final plat approval. A well-designed subdivision means little to a prospective lot buyer until such buyer can see actual physical transformation of raw land into lots with all necessary improvements provided. Likewise, a well-designed subdivision is not an asset to the community until the necessary improvements have been installed. In order that prospective lot purchasers may get useable products and new subdivisions may be an asset rather than a liability to the community, the subdivider shall install and/or pay for the improvements required by these regulations necessary to serve the subdivision prior to the approval of the final plat. 
                  (b)  Water supply. When a required water system is installed, water mains shall provide a minimum flow of water of 500 gallons per minute for four minutes or 250 gallons per minute for two hours at the furthermost point from the tank. Fire hydrants shall be provided at distances not greater than 1,000 feet apart. The water main may be located in the right-of-way, but may not be located under the pavement. Water lines three-fourths-inch in size shall be stubbed-out to the property line to serve each lot before the street is surfaced. When connection to a county water system is not available, the governing authority may make an exception to this rule. The water system shall be a permitted community water system as required by the State of Georgia Safe Water Drinking Act. 
                  An approved, signed copy from the EPD (environmental protection division) of the water system plans must be submitted prior to final plat approval. Well sites should be of sufficient size to accommodate and adequately maintain the well and storage tank provided. However, the well shall be located no closer than 50 feet to any exterior property line of the subdivision. 
                  (c)  Sanitary sewage. If a sanitary sewer is installed in a subdivision, sanitary sewers shall be installed to the plans and specifications approved by and in accordance with the rules and administrative regulations of the county health department. When the sewer line is located in a street right-of-way and it will be necessary to cut into the street surface to serve the abutting lots, a connection shall be stubbed-out to the property line to serve each lot prior to surfacing the street. 
                  (d)  Sewage disposal systems. Prior to the construction of any community sewage disposal system, such as a private septic tank, an oxidation pond or other facility, the location, size, plans and specifications of such a facility shall be approved by and be in accordance with the rules and administrative regulations of the governing authority and the county health department. 
                  (e)  Curbs and gutters. If concrete curbs or paved valley-type gutters are required, they shall be installed in accordance with plans and specifications prepared by an engineer, registered surveyor or architect, and approved by the county engineer or the local governing authority, or its designee. 
                  (f)  Street grading and surfacing. Street grading, base preparation, and surfacing shall be carried out by the subdivider according to plans and specifications approved by the county and the state department of transportation. 
                  (g)  Storm drainage. An adequate drainage system, including necessary open ditches, pipes, culverts, storm sewers, intersectional drains, drop inlets, bridges and other necessary appurtenances shall be installed by the subdivider according to plans and specifications approved by the county engineer. 
                  (h)  Street name signs. Street name signs shall be installed at all intersections within a subdivision. The location and design shall be approved by the governing authority or its designee. 
                  (i)  Topsoil. Topsoil shall not be removed from residential lots or used as spoil, but shall be redistributed so as to provide at least six inches of cover on the lots and at least four inches of cover between sidewalks and curbs, and shall be stabilized by seeding or planting. 
                  (j)  Paving. In all subdivisions, regardless of size, paving shall be required for all streets. 
                  (k)  Subdivision entrances. The building inspector shall coordinate with the county engineer with respect to entrances, driveways, or curb cuts. Design standards on county or state roads shall be consistent with all state, federal, and local laws and applicable ordinances, including the state department of transportation rules, and all amendments or revisions in effect as of the date of the preliminary plat approval. Safety, as well as available alternatives for reducing the number of entrances, driveways or curb cuts, will be considered.

                  The county shall not accept title to or assume responsibility for maintaining any street until at least one year after the street has been paved, and until at least 50 percent of the lots have been built upon. At such time as streets are accepted, they will meet road specifications.

                  The county commissioners shall not approve a subdivision in a location where the existing roads providing primary access are inadequate to serve the additional traffic generated by the development. If the ditches on existing county roads are to be used for drainage from the subdivision, the developer will regrade said ditches and provide an all-weather drainage outlet. All regrading and drainage outlets shall be approved by the governing authority or its authorized representatives.
