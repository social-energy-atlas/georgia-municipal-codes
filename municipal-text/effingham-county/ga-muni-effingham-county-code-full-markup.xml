PREFACE

        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE                   This Code constitutes a complete codification of the general and permanent ordinances and resolutions of Effingham County, Georgia. 
                  Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances and resolutions adopted by the board of commissioners. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any ordinance or resolution included herein. 
                  The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
                  Chapter and Section Numbering System 
                  The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
                  Page Numbering System 
                  The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

                   
                  Indexes 
                  The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
                  Looseleaf Supplements 
                  A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
                  Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
                  Acknowledgments 
                  This publication was under the direct supervision of Ron McLaughlin, Supervising Editor, and John Welch, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
                  The publisher is most grateful to Lamar Crosby, County Administrator, Alex Zipperer, County Attorney, and Sandra Andrews, County Clerk, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the county readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the county's affairs.

                  (5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meanings of resolution or ordinance sections inserted into the Code, but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of resolution material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code. 
                  Sec. 1-18. - Altering Code.

                  DIVISION 2. - PROCEDURE 

                  Sec. 6-221. - Procedure for suspension and revocation. 
                  (a)  An alcoholic beverage license may be suspended or revoked for cause upon written notice to the licensee by the zoning administrator. Cause for the suspension or revocation of such license shall consist of the violation of any laws or ordinances regulating such business or for the violation of any state or federal law; or for any change in the area where such business is located, which change is deemed by the board of commissioners to cause such business in such area to be undesirable; or any reason which would authorize the board of commissioners to refuse the issuance of a license; or any violation of this chapter. The sheriff's department shall notify the zoning administrator of a licensee or anyone in the employ of a licensee (i) being charged with or arrested for selling alcoholic beverages (A) to an underage person or persons or (B) on Sunday or (ii) being convicted of selling alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated person pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 3-3-22 during the current license year. 
                  (b)  Once the zoning administrator becomes aware of facts that, if true, could support the revocation or suspension of a license, he shall place the matter for hearing by the county administrator. No alcoholic beverage license which has been issued or which may hereafter be issued shall be suspended or revoked except for cause as defined in this section, after a hearing and upon written notice to the holder of such license of the time, place and purpose of such hearing and a statement of the charge or charges upon which such hearing shall be held. Three days' notice shall be deemed reasonable, but shorter or longer periods of notice shall be authorized as the board of commissioners may deem the circumstances to justify. 
                  (c)  The county administrator at such hearing shall hear evidence of the circumstances of the sale to the underage person or persons, of the unauthorized Sunday sale, or the sale to an intoxicated person, or such other violation of this chapter, and after said hearing may recommend that the license to sell alcoholic beverages be suspended for a period up to six months or less or the county administrator may recommend to the board of commissioners that the license be suspended for a period of greater than six months or revoked. In addition, the county administrator may order that a responsible alcohol sales and service workshop approved by the zoning administrator be attended by the licensee at the licensee's expense. The recommendation of the county administrator shall be in writing and shall be transmitted to the owner of the alcoholic beverage license and to the licensee by certified mail. 
                  (d)  An order of the county administrator directing the licensee to attend a responsible alcohol sales and service workshop shall not be appealable. In the event the county administrator recommends that the alcoholic beverage license be suspended or revoked, the owner of the alcoholic beverage license, the licensee or both may appeal such recommendation to the board of commissioners. The appeal must be in writing and must be delivered to the county administrator within ten days of the date of receipt. If the owner of the alcoholic beverage license, the licensee or both should fail to appeal such recommendation then the owner of the alcoholic beverage license and the licensee shall be deemed to have acquiesced to such suspension or revocation and all rights to further appeals shall be deemed waived. 
                  (e)  In the event that owner of an alcoholic beverage license, the licensee, or both appeal the recommendation of the county administrator, the board of commissioners shall, within 30 days of the date that the appeal is filed, review a summary of the hearing before the county administrator wherein the alcoholic beverage license was considered for suspension or revocation (the summary shall be prepared by the county administrator) and either place the matter down for a hearing or affirm or alter the decision of the county administrator without a hearing. 
                  (f)  Should the board of commissioners place the matter down for hearing, the board shall provide the licensee not less than three days notice of the date of the hearing. In all hearings held pursuant to this section, the proceedings shall be as informal as compatible with justice, the hearing shall not exceed 30 minutes in length, and the following procedures shall prevail: 
                  (1)  The charges and specifications against the licensee and the response as filed by the licensee shall be read. 
                  (2)  The county representative shall present evidence, and then the licensee shall present his evidence, with opportunity for each party to present rebuttal evidence, examination and cross examination of witnesses, and interrogation by the board of commissioners. No evidence shall be presented which is not relevant to the charges. The board of commissioners and the county administrator may consider mitigating and aggravating circumstances in considering sanctions. 
                  (g)  After the hearing under this section if the board of commissioners determines due cause to exist, the board of commissioners may suspend, revoke or place on probation for a maximum of 12 months, with or without conditions, the license or holder. The board of commissioners may consider mitigating and aggravating circumstances in considering sanctions. 
                  (h)  In the event a license to sell alcoholic beverages is suspended a sign issued by the business license office shall be placed at each entrance to the facility wherein alcoholic beverages were sold with the sign providing, "THE LICENSE TO SELL ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES ISSUED TO THE OWNER AND LICENSEE OF THIS BUSINESS HAS BEEN SUSPENDED FROM _________ TO _________ AS A RESULT OF SELLING ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES TO AN UNDERAGE PERSON, AN INTOXICATED PERSON OR AN UNAUTHORIZED SUNDAY SALE." In the event a license to sell alcoholic beverages is revoked a sign issued by the business license office shall be placed at each entrance to the facility wherein alcoholic beverages were sold with the sign providing, "THE LICENSE TO SELL ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES ISSUED TO THE OWNER AND LICENSEE OF THIS BUSINESS HAS BEEN REVOKED AS A RESULT OF SELLING ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES TO AN UNDERAGE PERSON, AN INTOXICATED PERSON OR AN UNAUTHORIZED SUNDAY SALE." The sign shall stay in place for the period of suspension or in the case of a revocation for a period of 30 days. 
                  (Ord. of 3-18-08) 
                  Sec. 6-222. - Automatic revocation of county license upon revocation of state license. 
                  Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, whenever the state shall revoke any permit or license to manufacture or sell at wholesale or retail any alcoholic beverages, the county alcoholic beverage license shall be automatically revoked without any action by the board of commissioners.

                  (b)  Definitions. 
                  Building contractor. As used in this section, the word or term "building contractor" shall mean any person, firm, partnership, corporation, or other entity engaging in, undertaking, or carrying on any business consisting of or relating to building construction, repair, renovation, or making improvements to real property including dwellings, homes, buildings, structures, or fixtures attached thereto. 
                  Doing business. Any building contractor shall be deemed to be "doing business" subject to the requirements of this section if (a) he has or operates an office, agency, project site, or place of business located in the unincorporated areas of the county, whether permanently, temporarily, periodically, or otherwise or (b) is performing services as a building contractor in the unincorporated areas of the county. 
                  State of emergency. The term "state of emergency" is defined, pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 38-3-3(5), as a condition declared by the governor when, in his judgment, the threat or actual occurrence of a disaster is of sufficient severity and magnitude as to warrant extraordinary efforts in preventing or alleviating the damage, loss, hardship, or suffering threatened or caused thereby. 
                  Subsequent recovery period. The term "subsequent recovery period" is defined as that period during which the disaster continues to cause disruptions in the disaster area, but shall not exceed three months after the declaration has been terminated by the governor. 
                  (c)  Registration. All building contractors doing business or proposing to do business in the unincorporated areas of the county during a state of emergency or the subsequent recovery period shall register and file applications with the building and zoning administrator or such other person designated by the county board of commissioners. The building contractor shall, under oath, provide the county governing authority with a statement describing the general nature of the business to be conducted and give true and accurate information as may be called for on the registration form, application, or certificate provided by the county. 
                  (d)  Regulatory fee. Building contractor fees are hereby fixed under the terms and conditions of this section at $50.00. Fees shall be paid in full at the time of registration.

                  (g)  Revocation; suspension. Each permit issued under this section is a mere permit to engage in business only so long as said business is conducted in a lawful manner. The county governing authority reserves the right to revoke or suspend any permit granted hereunder if the building contractor violates this section or any other county, state, or federal law. If, after issuance of a permit to do business, the county desires to revoke said permit, written notice thereof shall be given to the building contractor, which notice shall specify the violation with which the building contractor is charged and a date, time, and place at which a hearing shall be held with regard to the violation. The building contractor shall have an opportunity to be heard at such hearing, shall have the right to be represented by counsel, and shall have the right to introduce and submit evidence in opposition to such revocation.

The permit drawings shall be kept at the site of work and shall be open to inspection by the building official or his authorized representative. 
                  (u)  Fees. 
                  (1)  Prescribed fees. A permit shall not be issued until the fees prescribed in section 8.5 of the county's zoning ordinance in appendix C of this Code have been paid, nor shall an amendment to a permit be released until the additional fee, if any, due to an increase in the estimated cost of the building, structure, electrical, plumbing, mechanical, or gas system, has been paid. 
                  (2)  Work commencing before permit issuance. Any person who commences any work on a building, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical, or plumbing system before obtaining the necessary permits shall be subject to a penalty of 100 percent of the usual permit fee in addition to the required permit fees. 
                  (3)  Accounting. The building official shall keep a permanent and accurate accounting of all permit fees and other monies collected, the names of all persons upon whose account such fees were along with the date and amount thereof. 
                  (4)  Schedule of permit fees. On all buildings, structures, electrical, plumbing, mechanical, and gas systems or alterations requiring a permit, a fee for each permit shall be paid as required at the time of filing application, in accordance with the schedule as established by the applicable governing authority. See the applicable appendix in the technical codes adopted in section 14-36 for suggested fee schedules. 
                  (v)  Building permit valuations. If, in the opinion of the building official, the valuation of building, alteration, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical, or plumbing systems appears to be underestimated on the application, the permit shall be denied, unless the applicant can show detailed estimates to meet the approval of the building official. Permit valuations shall include total cost, such as electrical, gas, mechanical, plumbing equipment, and other systems including materials and labor.

                  (1)  A landscaped buffer area a minimum of ten feet in width shall be maintained around the exterior of the security fencing. 
                  (2)  The buffer area is to consist of materials of the evergreen variety which can be expected to grow to form a continuous hedge of at least five feet in height within two years of planting. 
                  (3)  Native vegetation on the site shall be preserved to the greatest practical extent. The applicant shall provide a site plan showing existing significant vegetation to be removed, and vegetation to be replanted to replace that which was lost. 
                  (4)  Trees and scrubs in the vicinity of the guy wires shall be of a kind that would not exceed 20 feet in height or would not affect the stability of the guys, should they be uprooted, and shall not obscure visibility of the anchor from the transmission building or security facilities and staff/maintenance. 
                  (5)  In lieu of these standards, the administrator may allow use of an alternate detailed plan for landscape and screening, however, such plans must be prepared by a registered landscape architect and satisfy the requirements of this subsection, except cases in which lesser requirements are desirable for adequate visibility for security purposes and/or for continued operation of existing bona fide agricultural or forest uses such as farms, nurseries, and tree farms. In certain locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, such as remote agricultural or rural locations or developed heavy industrial areas, the landscaping requirements may be reduced or waived by the administrator. 
                  (i)  Principal, accessory, and joint uses. 
                  (1)  Accessory structures used in direct support of a tower shall be allowed but not used for offices, vehicle storage, or other outdoor usage. Mobile or immobile equipment not used in direct support of a tower facility shall not be stored or parked on the tower site, unless repairs to the tower and/or related equipment are being made. 
                  (2)  Towers may be located on sites containing another principle use in the same buildable area. As long as all of the other siting, setback, separation, and general requirements of this article are met, towers may occupy a parcel meeting the minimum lot size requirements for the zoning district in which it is located. The minimum distance between a tower and other principal use located on the same lot shall be for a monopole or lattice tower the greater of 20 percent of the tower height or 25 feet and for a guy tower the greater of 100 percent breakpoint or 25 feet. If applicant's engineer certifies a fall zone or separation greater than listed above, the engineer's specification governs. The aforementioned separation requirements are required to assure compatibility of land uses and to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of individuals and structures occupying the same site. 
                  (3)  Joint use of a site is prohibited when a proposed or existing principal use includes the storage, distribution, or sale of volatile, flammable, explosive, or hazardous materials, including but not limited to propane, gasoline, natural gas, and dangerous chemicals. 
                  (j)  Historic sites. Telecommunications facilities shall not be attached to the facade or parapet of any architecturally or historically significant building or structure located in a recognized historical area. Antennae shall be permitted only on rooftops of buildings and structures a minimum of 50 feet in height, provided that such attachments shall not be visible from adjacent pedestrian walkways or streets, do not adversely impact the structural integrity or significance of the building or structure, and so long as the addition of said antenna adds no more than 20 feet to the height of the structure. 
                  (k)  Adherence to FAA regulations. The passage of the ordinance from which this article derives requires adherence to Part 77 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and that all placement of towers and antennae must be approved by the FAA before a building permit or placement is allowed. This approval is generally granted by the completion of form "FAA Form 7460-1" or its equivalent.

                  New telecommunications tower sites shall be developed with the capacity to provide shared use or colocation among two or more providers. New telecommunications towers designed for the sole use of a single provider shall be prohibited. 
                  (1)  Applicants for new telecommunications tower construction shall document specific intent to permit the shared use/colocation of such facilities with the apparatus/equipment of other commercial wireless telecommunications providers. All applicants shall identify how the applicant will make available such shared use/colocation of the tower and site, including the identification of space suitable for additional equipment. 
                  (2)  Applicants for telecommunications towers in locations where there is not technically available space for colocation or shared use shall demonstrate in writing to the building and zoning department that no existing tower or alternative tower structure can accommodate the proposed antenna. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing tower or alternative tower structure can accommodate the proposed antenna shall consist of any of the following documentation: 
                  a.  No existing telecommunications facilities or alternative tower structures are located within the geographic area necessary to meet the applicant's engineering requirements. 
                  b.  Existing telecommunications facilities or alternative tower structures have insufficient height and cannot be modified to accommodate the applicant's engineering requirements. 
                  c.  Existing telecommunications facilities or alternative tower structures do not possess sufficient structural integrity or strength and cannot be modified in such a manner that would support the proposed antenna and related equipment. 
                  d.  The proposed antenna would cause interference with the antennae on the existing tower or alternative tower structure, or the antennae on the existing tower or alternative tower structure would cause interference with the applicant's proposed antenna. 
                  (3)  Applicants for telecommunications towers in locations where there is not financially feasible available space for shared use/colocation shall demonstrate in writing to the building and zoning department that the fees, costs, or contractual provisions required by the owner in order to share an existing tower or alternative tower structure or to adapt an existing tower or alternative tower structure for shared use/colocation exceed 60 percent of the cost of construction of a new telecommunications tower. 
                  (4)  Alternative tower structure (accessory use). The construction of a tower as an accessory use to a principal use (alternative tower structure) in a zoning district not permitting wireless telecommunications towers shall comply with the following: 
                  a.  Written documentation shall be provided explaining the need for such tower, how the proposed tower relates to the primary purpose and function of the principal use and identifying the location of the alternative tower structure's antenna on the proposed tower. 
                  b.  The accessory tower shall be maintained for the needs of the alternative tower structure. An accessory tower use shall not be exclusively used for the leasing of space to commercial interests. 
                  c.  The principal use (alternative tower structure) and the accessory tower shall be under the same ownership. 
                  d.  The construction of accessory towers for leasing to commercial interests shall be prohibited on properties where the alternative tower structure is scheduled to be closed or changed into a use that would not permit antenna placement. 
                  e.  Such accessory towers shall be monopoles not exceeding height recommendations stated in the applicant's engineering requirements. 
                  (Ord. of 1-5-99, § 1606(VI))

                  Sec. 30-121. - General provisions. 
                  Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the ordinance and the NPDES General Permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of sections 30-122 and 30-123. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES General Permit. 
                  (Ord. of 9-20-11; Ord. of 2-7-17 ) 
                  Sec. 30-122. - Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
                  (a)  Best management practices as set forth in this section and section 30-123 shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (b) of this section or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection, the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
                  (b)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by Effingham County or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land-disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  (c)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by Effingham County or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (d)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land-disturbing activities occur. 
                  (e)  Effingham County may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsection 30-123(15) and (16), in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
                  (Ord. of 9-20-11) 
                  Sec. 30-123. - Rules and regulations. 
                  (a)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practical erosion potential; 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  (7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation, and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection 30-122(b); 
                  (15)  Except as provided in paragraph (16) and (17) of this subsection, there is established a 25 foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or where bulkheads and sea walls are installed to prevent shoreline erosion on Lake Oconee and Lake Sinclair; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term 'ephemeral stream' means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; 
                  (16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (17)  There is established a 25 foot buffer along coastal marshlands, as measured horizontally from the coastal marshland-upland interface, as determined in accordance with Chapter 5 of Title 12 of this title, the "Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1970." And the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where an alteration within the buffer area has been authorized pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-286, for maintenance of any currently serviceable structure, landscaping, or hardscaping, including bridges, roads, parking lots, golf courses, golf cart paths, retaining walls, bulkheads, and patios; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, where a drainage structure or roadway drainage structure is constructed or maintained; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, on the landward side of any currently serviceable shoreline stabilization structure, or for the maintenance of any manmade storm-water detention basin, golf course pond, or impoundment that is located entirely within the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. For the purposes of this paragraph maintenance shall be defined as actions necessary or appropriate for retaining or restoring a currently serviceable improvement to the specified operable condition to achieve its maximum useful life. Maintenance includes emergency reconstruction of recently damaged parts of a currently serviceable structure so long as it occurs within a reasonable period of time after damage occurs. Maintenance does not include any modification that changes the character, scope or size of the original design and serviceable shall be defined as usable in its current state or with minor maintenance but not so degraded as to essentially require reconstruction. 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to crossings for utility lines that cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer, provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
                  c.  The buffer shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity conducted pursuant to and in compliance with a valid and effective land-disturbing permit issued subsequent to April 22, 2014, and prior to December 31, 2015; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented or any lot for which the preliminary plat has been approved prior to December 31, 2015 if roadways, bridges, or water and sewer lines have been extended to such lot prior to the effective date of this Act and if the requirement to maintain a 25 foot buffer would consume at least 18 percent of the high ground of the platted lot otherwise available for development; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
                  d.  Activities where the area within the buffer is not more than 500 square feet or that have a "minor buffer impact" as defined in 391-3-7-.01(r), provided that the total area of buffer impacts is less than 5,000 square feet are deemed to have an approved buffer variance by rule. Bank stabilization structures are not eligible for coverage under the variance by rule and notification shall be made to the division at least 14 days prior to the commencement of land disturbing activities. 
                  (b)  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent Effingham County from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in sections 30-122 and 30-123. 
                  (c)  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit.

                  Sec. 30-132. - Application requirements. 
                  (a)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the unincorporated area of Effingham County without first obtaining a permit from the developmental services department to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
                  (b)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the developmental services department and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in section 30-133. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of section 30-122 and 30-123 will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by five copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
                  (c)  A fee in the amount of $40.00 for each acre shall be charged for each acre or fraction thereof in the project area. 
                  (d)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  (e)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, Effingham County shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The District shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of The district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the District review shall be forwarded to Effingham County. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by subsection 30-123(15) and (16) have been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per this subsection, have been obtained. Such review will not be required if Effingham County and the district have entered into an agreement which allows Effingham County to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. Effingham County shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of Effingham County to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
                  (f)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this article section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, Effingham County may deny the permit application.

                  This article shall be known and may be cited as the "Water Supply Watersheds Protection Ordinance." 
                  (Ord. of 11-6-12) 
                  Sec. 30-201. - Purpose and intent. 
                  The quality of public drinking water supplies must be assured. Land disturbing activities associated with development can increase erosion and sedimentation, which threaten the storage capacity of reservoirs and impair the quality of public drinking water supplies. Stormwater runoff, particularly from impervious surfaces, can introduce toxins, nutrients, and sediments into drinking water supplies, making water treatment more complicated and expensive, and rendering water resources unusable for recreation and other uses. Industrial land uses that involve the manufacture, use, transport, and storage of hazardous or toxic waste materials result in potential risks of contamination of nearby public drinking water supplies. Therefore, land use activities within water supply watersheds must be regulated to ensure that public water supplies remain clean. This article establishes standards consistent with the Georgia Department of Natural Resources' Rules for Environmental Planning Criteria for Water Supply Watersheds (Rule 391-3-16-01) to ensure water quality in the watershed system is not compromised by land activities such as grading, septic systems, and accidental release of contaminants. The intent of this article is to minimize the transport of pollutants and sediment to the water supply, to maintain the yield of water supply watersheds, and to ensure water can be treated to meet federal and state drinking water standards.

                  Sec. 30-221. - Purpose and intent. 
                  Groundwater is among the Nation's most important natural resources. It provides drinking water to urban and rural communities, supports irrigation and industry, sustains the flow of streams and rivers, and maintains riparian and wetland ecosystems. In many areas of the Nation, the future sustainability of groundwater resources is at risk from overuse and contamination. Because groundwater systems typically respond slowly to human actions, a long-term perspective is needed to manage this valuable resource. This article is intended to implement rules of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources' Environmental Protection Division known as the "Rules for Environmental Planning Criteria" as they specifically relate to groundwater recharge areas (Rule 391-3-16-.02). It is essential to the health, safety, and welfare of the public that the quality of subsurface public drinking water be maintained. Groundwater resources exist in underground reservoirs known as aquifers. These aquifers are zones of rock beneath the earth's surface that are capable of providing water for a well. They occupy vast regions of the subsurface and are replenished by infiltration of surface water runoff in zones of the surface, known as groundwater recharge areas. Groundwater is susceptible to contamination when development occurs within groundwater recharge areas. Certain land use activities, such as septic tanks, underground tanks, and chemical spills, pose a significant threat to the quality of groundwater supplies. Therefore, it is necessary to manage land uses within groundwater recharge areas in order to ensure that pollution threats and development impacts are minimized. To this end, this article establishes minimum lot sizes to provide for the orderly and safe development of property utilizing on-site sewage management systems.

                  Sec. 30-241. - Purpose and intent. 
                  Wetlands are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion, and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; and open space and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the well being of communities in the State of Georgia. Nationally, a considerable number of wetlands have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution and other activities. Without additional regulation, piecemeal or cumulative losses of wetlands will continue to occur over time. Therefore, it is in the interest of public safety and general welfare to avoid damage or destruction to wetlands. The purpose of this article is to promote wetlands protection by adopting a generalized wetlands map; provide for the withholding of land use and building permits in areas designated as wetlands until a jurisdictional wetland determination is completed; and establish permitted and prohibited land uses within wetlands shown on the generalized wetlands map.

                  Generalized wetlands map: A National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) map showing wetlands within the local jurisdiction. 
                  Jurisdictional wetland: An area that meets the definitional requirements for wetlands as determined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
                  Jurisdictional wetland determination: A delineation of jurisdictional wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. §1344, as amended. 
                  Regulated activity: Any activity which will, or which may reasonably be expected to, result in the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the U.S. excepting those activities exempted in Section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act. 
                  Wetlands: Those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas (see Figure). The ecological parameters for designating wetlands include hydric soils, hydrophytic vegetation, and hydrological conditions that involve a temporary or permanent source of water to cause soil saturation.

                  ARTICLE VII. - PROTECTED RIVER CORRIDORS 

                  Sec. 30-250. - Title. 
                  This article shall be known and may be cited as a "Protected River Corridors Ordinance." 
                  (Ord. of 11-6-12) 
                  Sec. 30-251. - Purpose. 
                  River corridors are the strips of land that flank major rivers in Georgia. These corridors are of vital importance to Georgia in that they help preserve those qualities that make a river suitable as a habitat for wildlife, a site for recreation, and a source for clean drinking water. River corridors also allow the free movement of wildlife from area to area within the state, help control erosion and river sedimentation, and help absorb floodwaters. The Savannah and Ogeechee Rivers have been designated as protected rivers by the State of Georgia. The purpose of this article is to establish measures to guide future growth and development in the areas adjacent to the protected rivers as defined herein. The river corridor regulations established in this article require the maintenance of buffers where natural vegetation is left intact along the banks of protected rivers. Preservation of the soil and plants within the corridor reduces non-point source pollution entering the rivers and minimizes riverbank erosion. The vegetation acts to slow down water flow and trap sediment and other contaminants carried in runoff before they reach downstream water supplies. This article also minimizes disturbance of the natural terrain and vegetation and protects water quality through various use limitations. 
                  (Ord. of 11-6-12) 
                  Sec. 30-252. - Definitions. 
                  [The following definitions shall apply in the interpretation and enforcement of this article, unless otherwise specifically stated:] 
                  Hazardous waste: Any solid waste which has been defined as a hazardous waste in regulations promulgated by the administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to the federal act, which are in force and effect on February 1, 1988, codified as 40 C.F.R. Section 261.3. (Note: This is same definition as used in the Georgia Hazardous Waste Management Act.) 
                  Land disturbing activity: Any grading, scraping, excavating, or filling of land; clearing of vegetation; and any construction, rebuilding, or alteration of a structure. Land disturbing activity shall not include activities such as ordinary maintenance and landscaping operations, individual home gardens, yard and grounds upkeep, repairs, additions or minor modifications to a single-family dwelling, and the cutting of firewood for personal use. 
                  Natural vegetative buffer or buffer area: A river corridor containing the flora native to that area. The natural floras for specific areas are described in Georgia Geologic Survey Bulletin 114, "The Natural Environments of Georgia." Habitats for endangered and threatened species may require human management of the river corridor in order to maintain those species. 
                  Perennial river: A river or section of a river that flows continuously throughout the year. 
                  Port facility: Any facility for the docking, loading, and unloading of ships. 
                  Protected river: Any perennial river or watercourse with an average annual flow of at least 400 cubic feet per second as determined by the appropriate U.S. Geological Survey quadrangle map (the most recently published U.S. Geological Survey 7.5 minute topographic map prepared at a scale of 1:24,000). However, those segments of river covered by the Metropolitan River Protection Act or the Coastal Marshlands Protection Act are specifically excluded from the definition of a protected river. In coastal areas, the seaward limit of any protected river shall be the inland limit of the jurisdiction of the Coastal Marshlands Protection Act. The DNR has determined for administrative purposes that the line dividing protected coastal marshlands and protected river corridors is along the route of U.S. Highway 17. 
                  Public utility or utilities: A service or services provided by a public utility company or a private entity which provides such service or services and all equipment and structures necessary to provide such services. 
                  Riverbank: The rising ground, bordering a river, which serves to confine the water to the natural channel during the normal course of flow. Riverbanks are usually marked by a break in slope. 
                  River corridor: All the land, inclusive of islands, not regulated under the Metropolitan River Protection Act (O.C.G.A. § 12-5-440 through 12-5-457), or the Coastal Marshlands Protection Act (O.C.G.A. § 12-5-280 through 12-5-293), in areas of a protected river and being within 100 feet horizontally on both sides of a protected river as measured from the riverbanks. Because stream channels move due to natural processes such as meandering, riverbank erosion, and jumping of channels, the river corridor may shift with time. 
                  Sensitive natural area: Any area, as identified now or hereafter by the DNR, which contains one or more of the following: habitat, including nesting sites, occupied by rare or endangered species; rare or exemplary natural communities; significant landforms, hydroforms, or geological features; or other areas so designated by the DNR; and which are sensitive or vulnerable to physical or biological alteration. 
                  Single-family dwelling: A dwelling structure that is designed for the use of one family or household.

                  Sec. 30-301. - Findings of fact. 
                  It is hereby determined that: 
                  (1)  The land development process significantly alters the hydrologic response of development sites, increasing stormwater runoff rates, volumes and pollutant loads, and increases flooding, channel erosion and pollutant transport and deposition in rivers and streams; 
                  (2)  The land development process significantly alters the hydrologic response of development sites, increasing stormwater runoff rates, volumes and pollutant loads, and alters water levels and fluctuations and increases pollutant transport and deposition in wetlands; 
                  (3)  The land development process significantly alters the hydrologic response of development sites, increasing stormwater runoff rates, volumes and pollutant loads, and alters salinity concentrations and fluctuations and increases primary productivity and pollutant transport and deposition in estuaries; 
                  (4)  The land development process significantly alters the hydrologic response of development sites, increasing stormwater runoff rates, volumes and pollutant loads, and increases bacteria transport and deposition in near coastal waters, which leads to beach contamination and poses a serious threat to human health; 
                  (5)  The land development process significantly alters the hydrologic response of development sites, increasing stormwater runoff rates and volumes, and decreases the amount of rainfall that is available to recharge shallow groundwater aquifers; 
                  (6)  The negative impacts of the land development process on local aquatic resources can adversely affect the health, safety and general welfare of the general public; 
                  (7)  The negative impacts of the land development process can be controlled and minimized through the management of stormwater runoff rates, volumes and pollutant loads; 
                  (8)  Communities located within Georgia's Coastal Non-point Source Management Area and Area of Special Interest are required to comply with a number of state and federal regulations that require the adverse impacts of the land development process to be controlled and minimized; and, 
                  (9)  Therefore, Effingham County has determined that it is in the public interest to control and minimize the adverse impacts of the land development process and has established this set of local stormwater management regulations to control post-construction stormwater runoff rates, volumes and pollutant loads on development and redevelopment sites.

                  c.  Control discharge to municipal storm sewers of spills, dumping or disposal of materials other than stormwater; and 
                  d.  Control, through intergovernmental agreements, contribution of pollutants from one municipal/county system to another. 
                  (2)  Establishing decision-making processes that can be applied during the site planning and design process to help protect the integrity of local aquatic resources; 
                  (3)  Establishing post-construction stormwater management and site planning and design criteria to help protect natural resources from the direct impacts of the land development process and preserve existing hydrologic conditions on development sites; 
                  (4)  Establishing post-construction stormwater management and site planning and design criteria to help reduce flooding, channel erosion and pollutant transport and deposition in local aquatic resources; 
                  (5)  Establishing design guidelines for green infrastructure and stormwater management practices that can be used to meet the post-construction stormwater management and site planning and design criteria; 
                  (6)  Encouraging that green infrastructure practices, which include better site planning techniques, better site design techniques and low impact development practices, be used to the maximum extent practical on development sites; 
                  (7)  Establishing provisions for the long-term inspection and maintenance of green infrastructure and stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed and pose no threat to public safety; and 
                  (8)  Establishing administrative procedures for the submittal, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans and for the inspection of approved development projects.

                  Sec. 30-362. - Requirement to prevent, control and reduce stormwater pollutants. 
                  The county may adopt requirements identifying best management practices (BMPs) for any activity, operation, or facility, which may cause or contribute to pollution or contamination of stormwater, the MS4 or watercourses, or waters of the U.S. 
                  (1)  Pollution prevention in new facilities. The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the MS4 or watercourses through the use of these structural and non-structural BMPs. 
                  (2)  Pollution prevention in existing facilities. Any person responsible for a property or premise, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at said person's expense, additional structural and non-structural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the MS4 or watercourses. 
                  (3)  Discharge permits from regulatory agencies other than the county. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliant with the provisions of this section. BMPs designated for compliance with the NPDES permit or BMPs implemented as a result of action taken in compliance of this article shall be included in a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit.

                  Sec. 30-364. - Notification of spills. 
                  Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants discharging into stormwater, the MS4 or watercourses, or waters of the U.S. said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials said person shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of non-hazardous materials, said person shall notify the county engineer, or his designee in person, by phone, facsimile or email no later than the next business day. Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to the county engineer, or his designee within three business days of the phone notice. The notification of the discharge of materials to the county engineer, or his designee shall be in addition to notification of other applicable county, regional, state and federal authorities. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three years.

                  ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

                  Sec. 34-1. - Statutory authorization. 
                  Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and Section 36-1-20(a) of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the board of commissioners of Effingham County, Georgia, does ordain as follows: 
                  (Ord. of 3-3-15, § 1) 
                  Sec. 34-2. - Findings of fact. 
                  (a)  The flood hazard areas of Effingham County, Georgia, are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (b)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
                  (Ord. of 3-3-15, § 1) 
                  Sec. 34-3. - Statement of purpose. 
                  It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
                  (4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and 
                  (5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters. 
                  (Ord. of 3-3-15, § 1) 
                  Sec. 34-4. - Objectives.

                  (1)  To protect human life and health; 
                  (2)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
                  (3)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; 
                  (4)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
                  (5)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
                  (6)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; and 
                  (7)  To insure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

                  (4)  Generating plants, and other principal points of utility lines. 
                  Development means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavating, drilling operations, and storage of materials or equipment. 
                  Elevated building means a non-basement building built to have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area elevated above the ground level by means of fill, solid foundation perimeter walls, pilings, columns, piers, or shear walls adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a base flood event. 
                  Existing construction for the purposes of determining rates, means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced before March 18, 1987, the effective date of the initial FIRM for Effingham County. 
                  Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before August 5, 1986, the effective date of the first floodplain management regulations adopted by Effingham County. 
                  Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed, including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads. 
                  Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
                  (1)  The overflow of inland or tidal waters; or 
                  (2)  The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source. 
                  Flood hazard boundary map (FHBM) means an official map of a community, issued by the Federal Insurance Administration, where the boundaries of areas of special flood hazard have been defined as zone A. 
                  Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means an official map of a community, issued by the Federal Insurance Administration, delineating the areas of special flood hazard and/or risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
                  Flood insurance study means the official report by the Federal Insurance Administration evaluating flood hazards and containing flood profiles and water surface elevations of the base flood. 
                  Floodplain means any land area susceptible to flooding. 
                  Floodproofing means any combination of structural and non-structural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures, which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents. 
                  Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
                  Freeboard means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of floodplain management. "Freeboard" tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed. 
                  Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, adjacent to the proposed foundation of a building. 
                  Historic structure means any structure that is: 
                  (1)  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register;

                  a.  By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior; or 
                  b.  Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs. 
                  Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement. An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage, in an area other than a basement, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of other provisions of this code. 
                  Manufactured home means a building, transportable in one or more sections, built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and similar transportable structures placed on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer and intended to be improved property. 
                  Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
                  Mean sea level means the average height of the sea for all stages of the tide. It is used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain. For purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988 is the datum to which base flood elevations shown on Effingham County's flood insurance rate map are referenced. 
                  New construction means, for the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced after March 18, 1987, the effective date of the initial FIRM for Effingham County, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced after August 5, 1986, the effective date of the first floodplain management regulations adopted by Effingham County, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
                  New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed after August 5, 1986, the effective date of the first floodplain management regulations adopted by Effingham County. 
                  North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88) has replaced the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 in existing and future FEMA Flood Modernization Maps. NAVD 88 is used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain. For purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the NAVD 88 is the datum to which base flood elevations shown on Effingham County's flood insurance rate map are referenced. 
                  Recreational vehicle means a vehicle, which is: 
                  (1)  Built on a single chassis;

                  (3)  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and 
                  (4)  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
                  Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (NOTE: accessory structures are NOT exempt from any ordinance requirements.) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
                  Subdivision means the division of a single lot into two or more lots for the purpose of sale or development. 
                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
                  Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the "start of construction" of the improvement. NOTE: The market value of the structure should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
                  For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include (1) those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project, or (2) any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions means where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. 
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as evidence of compliance is provided.

                  (c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the board of commissioners may appeal such decision to the Superior Court of Effingham County, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1. 
                  (d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided that the criteria of this section are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (g)  In reviewing such requests, the board of commissioners shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this chapter. 
                  (h)  Conditions for variances: 
                  (1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
                  b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  (2)  The provisions of this chapter are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of a historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (4)  The county engineer shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to FEMA upon request. 
                  (i)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this chapter, the board of commissioners may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

                  ARTICLE III. - PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

                  Sec. 34-81. - General standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure; 
                  (2)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage; 
                  (3)  New construction or substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
                  (4)  Elevated buildings. All new construction or substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater: 
                  a.  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
                  1.  Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
                  2.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and 
                  3.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both directions. 
                  b.  So as not to violate the "lowest floor" criteria of this chapter, the unfinished or flood resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area; and 
                  c.  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms.

                  Sec. 38-3. - Smoking in public buildings. 
                  (a)  This section is enacted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 16-12-2(c), which specifically authorizes the enactment of local ordinances prohibiting smoking. 
                  (b)  The smoking of tobacco products presents serious public health concerns to the state and to the citizens of the state. The Surgeon General has determined that smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease, and other serious diseases, and that there are hundreds of thousands of tobacco-related deaths in the United States each year. These diseases most often do not appear until many years after the person in question begins smoking. The presence of tobacco smoke in places used by or open to the public is offensive to and hazardous to non-smokers. 
                  (c)  All buildings in the unincorporated area of Effingham County which are used by or open to the public are designated no-smoking areas. 
                  (d)  Effective January 1, 2003, no certificate of occupancy shall be issued to the owner or occupant of any building in the unincorporated area of the county intended to be used by or open to the public unless signs are posted therein clearly designating such building a no-smoking area. 
                  (e)  Effective November 21, 2002 all buildings in the unincorporated area of the county used by or open to the public shall be posted with signs clearly designating such building a no-smoking area. 
                  (f)  The board of health is authorized to adopt reasonable regulations regarding the number and placement of no-smoking signs. 
                  (g)  The board of health may conduct periodic inspections of any building in the unincorporated area of the county used by or open to the public for the purpose of determining whether or not said building and owners or occupants thereof are in compliance with this section and board of health rules and regulations. 
                  (h)  A person who smokes tobacco in any form, smokes from any battery operated electronic smoking device designed to deliver nicotine, and/or other substances through a vapor inhaled by the user or uses smokeless tobacco products in any building in the unincorporated area of the county that is used by or open to the public and that is clearly designated by a no-smoking sign may be prosecuted pursuant to section 1-19 of this Code.

The requirements of this section should be considered minimum requirements, and where any provision of this section imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule or regulation, or other provision of law, whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall be considered to take precedence. 
                  (4)  Severability. If the provisions of any article, section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this section shall be judged invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such order of judgment shall not affect or invalidate the remainder of any article, section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this section. 
                  (b)  Definitions.

                  (3)  The person is the owner or tenant in lawful possession of such property, or has first obtained consent of the owner or tenant in lawful possession, or unless the act is done under the personal direction of the owner or tenant, all in a manner consistent with the public welfare. 
                  The discharge of construction site waste such as, but not limited to, concrete washout, chemicals, fuel, sanitary waste, and construction debris from construction sites, is prohibited. 
                  (d)  Vehicle loads causing litter. No person shall operate any motor vehicle with a load on or in such vehicle unless the load on or in such vehicle is adequately secured to prevent the dropping or shifting of materials from such load onto the roadway.

                  (1)  Violations. It shall be unlawful for any person to violate or fail to comply with any of the requirements of this section.

                  (2)  Evidence. 
                  a.  Whenever litter is thrown, deposited, dropped or dumped from any motor vehicle, boat, airplane, or other conveyance in violation of this section, it shall be prima facie evidence that the operator of the conveyance has violated this section. 
                  b.  Except as provided in subsection (1), whenever any litter which is dumped, deposited, thrown or left on public or private property in violation of this section is discovered to contain any article or articles, including but not limited to letters, bills, publications or other writing which display the name of the person thereon in such a manner as to indicate that the article belongs or belonged to such person, it shall be a rebuttable presumption that such person has violated this section.

                  d.  The court may publish the names of persons convicted of violating this ordinance.

                  (a)  Overcharging prohibited. It shall be unlawful during a declared state of emergency or subsequent period of recovery in which the county has been declared a disaster area for any person, firm, or corporation located or doing business in the unincorporated part of the county to overcharge for any goods, materials, services, or housing within the unincorporated part of the county. 
                  (b)  Definitions. 
                  Overcharging. The term "overcharging" is defined as charging prices for goods, materials, services, or housing that are substantially in excess of the customary or applicable cases substantially in excess of the supplier's or provider's costs for such goods, materials, services, or housing. Overcharging shall be presumed in the event of a substantial price increase during times of emergency or subsequent recovery as compared to the price charged immediately prior to the onset of the emergency, but such presumption shall be rebuttable where the increase in price is attributable to higher costs to the provider or supplier. 
                  State of emergency. The term "state of emergency" is defined, pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 38-3-3(5), as a condition declared by the governor when, in his judgment, the threat or actual occurrence of a disaster or emergency is of sufficient severity and magnitude as to warrant extraordinary efforts in preventing or alleviating the damage, loss, hardship, or suffering threatened or caused thereby. 
                  Subsequent recovery period. The term "subsequent recovery period" is defined as that period during which the disaster continues to cause disruptions in the disaster area, but shall not exceed six months after the emergency declaration has been terminated by the Governor unless extended by resolution of the county board of commissioners.

                  Sec. 42-10. - Door-to-door solicitation/canvassing. 
                  (1)  Intent and purpose. The intent of the board of commissioners in enacting this article is to regulate the sale of goods and services by solicitors or canvassers at residences in the county in order to diminish criminal activity in the county and abusive techniques utilized by any such solicitor or canvasser which adversely affect the public health, safety and welfare in the county. This article is not intended as a de facto prohibition of door-to-door solicitation, nor is it an attempt to adversely affect interstate commerce. Instead, this article is intended to balance competing interests, reduce criminal activity and protect county citizens from abusive sales techniques versus the conduct of proper commercial sales activity. This article is not intended to allow any business activity which would otherwise be unlawful. 
                  (2)  Definitions. In this article, the term solicitor or canvasser means any person who solicits orders on behalf of a firm, corporation, company, association, partnership or individual for any goods, services, wares or merchandise or other things of value, from house to house. Any person who obtains orders for merchandise, services, or other things of value shall be deemed a solicitor. The term solicitor or canvasser shall not mean an individual or field sales representative working for or on behalf of a bona fide charitable or nonprofit organization, or students or parents of students (i.e., PTA, booster club organizations) participating in approved school-sponsored fund raisers. 
                  (3)  Solicitor/canvasser permit. 
                  (a)  Permit required; applicability of article. 
                  1.  Resident/nonresident solicitors/canvassers. All solicitors or canvassers are subject to all rules and regulations of this article. 
                  (b)  Application; investigation of applicant; grounds for denial. 
                  1.  No solicitor/canvasser shall be authorized to solicit orders until he files an application with the county sheriff's office and obtains a permit and registers as a solicitor. This application shall be upon forms prescribed by the county sheriff's office. Upon application, the county sheriff's office, within ten days, shall examine the police record, if any, of the applicant. The sheriff shall determine whether there are any records of complaints against the applicant in the records of the sheriff's office or the GCIC/NCIC crime database system. The sheriff may, at his discretion, conduct a background check of the corporate officers or any other person named on the application. The sheriff may, at his discretion, make any other inquiries he deems necessary for the investigation of the applicant including but not limited a search of the Better Business Bureau.

Promptly after receipt from any third party by the county of a written notice of any demand, claim or circumstance that, immediately or with the lapse of time, would give rise to a claim or the commencement (or threatened commencement) of any action, proceeding or investigation (an "asserted claim") that may result in losses for which indemnification may be sought hereunder, the county shall give written notice thereof (the "claims notice") to the residential service provider; provided, however, that a failure to give such notice shall not prejudice the county's right to indemnification hereunder except to the extent that the residential service provider is actually and materially prejudiced thereby.

The residential service provider may elect to compromise or defend, at its own expense and by its own counsel, any asserted claim. If the residential service provider elects to compromise or defend such asserted claim, it shall, within 20 business days following its receipt of the claims notice (or sooner, if the nature of the asserted claim so required), notify the county of its intent to do so, and the county shall cooperate, at the expense of the residential service provider, in the compromise of, or defense against, such asserted claim.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the residential service provider nor the county shall settle or compromise any claim without the consent of the other party; provided, however, that such consent to settlement or compromise shall not be unreasonably withheld. In any event, the county and the residential service provider may participate, at their own expense, in the defense of such asserted claim. If the residential service provider chooses to defend any asserted claim, the county shall make available to the residential service provider any books, records or other documents within its control that are necessary or appropriate for such defense.

                  In addition to the other remedies provided in this article for the collection of the occupation tax levied in this article, the zoning administrator, upon any tax or installment of the tax becoming delinquent and remaining unpaid, shall issue execution for the correct amount of the tax against the persons, partnership, or corporation liable for the tax, which execution shall bear interest at the rate of seven percent per annum from the date when such tax or installment becomes delinquent; and the lien shall cover the property in the county of the person, partnership, or corporation liable for the tax, all as provided by the ordinances of the county and the laws of the state. The lien of such occupation tax shall become fixed on and date from the time when such tax or any installment thereof becomes delinquent.

The amendment may increase or lower the amounts and tax rates of any occupation and may change the classification thereof. The payment of any occupation tax provided for shall not be construed as prohibiting the levy or collection by the county of additional occupation taxes upon the same person, property, or business.

                  This article does not repeal or affect the force of any part of any ordinance heretofore passed where taxes levied under such prior ordinance have not been paid in full. So much and such parts of ordinances heretofore and hereinafter passed as provided for the issuing and enforcing of execution for any tax or assessment required by such ordinances, or that imposed fines or penalties for the nonpayment of such tax, or for failure to pay regulatory fees provided for in those ordinances, or failure to comply with any other provisions of this article, shall continue and remain in force until such tax, regulatory fee, or assessment shall be fully paid.

However, if the estimated tax liability for any monthly period shall exceed $2,500.00 for an operator who, in the prior fiscal year remitted tax greater than $2,500.00 in any three consecutive months, such operator shall file an estimated return and remit not less than 50 percent of the estimated tax liability for the monthly period by the 20th day of that same monthly period. The amount of tax so remitted shall be credited against the amount to be due with the regular return for the monthly period to be filed on the 20th day of the succeeding month.

                  (h)  Collection fee allowed operators. Operators collecting the tax shall be allowed a percentage of the tax due and accounted for and shall be reimbursed in the form of a deduction in submitting, reporting and paying the amount due, if the amount is not delinquent at the time of payment.

                  Editor's note— An ordinance adopted Aug. 5, 2003, as amended by an ordinance adopted Oct. 21, 2003, enacted provisions intended for use as ch. 39, art. I, §§ 39-1—39-32. For classification purposes, and to preserve the style and alphabetical chapter order of the Code, these provisions have been included herein as a new ch. 75, art. II, §§ 75-26—75-57, at the discretion of the editor. 

                  ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

                  Sec. 75-1. - Required connection to water, sewer and water reuse lines. 
                  New minor subdivisions, as defined in the subdivision regulations, shall be required to connect to county water, sewer, and reuse water lines where such lines are located in a road right-of-way or easement within 200 feet of the property line. Subdivisions containing three or less detached residences shall not be required to connect to a sewer force-main. 
                  Major subdivisions, as defined in the subdivision regulations, commercial or industrial developments shall be required to connect to county water, sewer, and reuse water lines if such lines are located within 1,000 feet of the property line. 
                  New single family residences shall not be required to connect to county water, sewer and reuse water lines. 
                  Residential, commercial and industrial water main extensions requirements: 
                  All specifications required by the county and by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources must be met by the developer. 
                  If an existing main must be extended to serve a particular development, the Developer will be required to pay all of the initial costs, including but not limited to, contract prices, testing fees, and engineering fees. Developers are required to extend all mains along their entire property frontage if the existing main is adjacent to the proposed development. 
                  All new water main extensions shall be sized, at minimum to meet the demand of the development as evidenced by an engineer's certification or a size equal to the existing county main, whichever pipe size is largest. The county may require that a larger pipe size be installed than is required by this section in order to extend water service beyond the property for which service is sought. If the county requires a larger pipe to be installed than is required by these standards, the county could participate in the cost of installing such pipe in the amount of the cost difference between installing the pipe needed to provide the capacity to serve the property and the pipe needed to accommodate the enlarged capacity required for extending water service beyond the property for which service is sought. 
                  The requirement to connect to water, sewer and reuse lines as stated in this section may be waived by the board of commissioners if they determine that the cost of extending the water, sewer and reuse lines outweighs the public benefit or there are circumstances unique to the project that make the extensions infeasible.

                  Sec. 75-2. - Optional connection to water, sewer and water reuse lines. 
                  The county shall not require the connection to water lines where existing structures are served by wells; nor shall the county require connection to sewer and reuse lines where existing structures are served by septic systems. The county shall not assess or collect any minimum fee or charge from owners of property with existing individual water and/or sewer services unless the property owner chooses to utilize the provided services.

                  Sec. 75-56. - Reuse water capacity. 
                  (a)  Property owners requesting sewer service for new developments (as defined in section 75-55) shall design and construct a reuse irrigation or other utilization system so as to ensure that reuse water is used and/or stored on-site; or used and/or stored off-site at a location adjacent to the property or existing or proposed reuse water lines per the county's reuse water master plan; or other location approved by the board of commissioners. The design of such reuse system shall be subject to the approval of the board of commissioners and the Georgia Department of Natural Resources Environmental Protection Division. Only individual parcel owners not within developments covered above shall have the option of not constructing a reuse irrigation or other utilization system. 
                  (b)  If an off-site location is not adjacent to existing or proposed reuse lines, the property owner shall pay the cost of extending such lines to the off-site location. 
                  (c)  All property owners requesting sewer service shall pay to the county a reuse water capacity capital recovery fee, where an equivalent residential unit means, with respect to a water customer, the number of residential units to which the water demand of that customer is equivalent, based on an average demand of 300 gallons per day for a single-family residential unit (detached). The reuse capital cost recovery fee shall be $1,300.00/ERU. If a reuse irrigation or other utilization system is constructed by the owner/developer, the $1,300.00/ERU fee shall be waived or credited in accordance with Section 9 of the Development Impact Fee Ordinance and the following paragraphs. 
                  (1)  If developer is able to accept 100 percent of the reuse generated by the subject development, as determined per ERU: 
                  a.  The developer will be required to submit an engineer's evaluation of the proposed reuse sites for review by Effingham County staff and/or its designated engineer to determine the subject sites' beneficial irrigation capacity. 
                  b.  The developer will be required to consummate a reuse agreement with the BOC under the county's terms and conditions. 
                  c.  The reuse capital cost recovery fee as established within the Effingham County Code of Ordinances, currently $1,300.00/ERU, will be waived. 
                  (2)  Developer is able to accept more than 100 percent of the reuse generated by the subject development, as determined per ERU: 
                  a.  The developer will be required to submit an engineer's evaluation of the proposed reuse sites for review by Effingham County staff and/or its designated engineer to determine the subject sites' beneficial irrigation capacity.

                  c.  The reuse capital cost recovery fee as established within the Effingham County Code of Ordinances, currently $1,300.00/ERU, will be waived for 100 percent of the subject development's reuse capacity and a credit given for any capacity generated in excess of the subject development's demand. Credit will be remitted from the reuse capital cost recovery fees generated at the time of collection of said fees for building permits within developments that are unable to provide reuse capacity. Said fees will be remitted quarterly to the subject developer. 
                  (3)  Developer is able to accept some portion less than 100 percent of the reuse generated by the subject development, as determined per ERU: 
                  i.  The developer will be required to submit an engineer's evaluation of the proposed reuse sites for review by Effingham County staff and/or its designated engineer to determine the subject sites' beneficial irrigation capacity. 
                  ii.  The developer will be required to consummate a reuse agreement with the BOC under their terms and conditions. 
                  iii.  The reuse capital cost recovery fee as established within the Effingham County Code of Ordinances, currently $1,300.00/ERU, will be waived for the reuse capacity generated per ERU on a percentage basis. The builder/developer will be required to remit to the BOC at the time a building permit is issued the outstanding percentage of the reuse capital cost recovery fee as established within the Effingham County Code of Ordinances. 
                  (4)  Reuse water capital cost recovery fees for detached/attached housing and nonresidential structures shall be charged according to the following table: 

                   
                  (5)  If a reuse irrigation or other utilization system is constructed by the owner/developer, the fee shall be waived or credited in accordance with Section 9 of the Development Impact Fee Ordinance and the above paragraphs (1), (2), or (3). 
                  (d)  The property owner shall construct and maintain the reuse water irrigation or other utilization system; provided that, at the discretion of the board of commissioners, the county may accept ownership and maintenance responsibility of a reuse system where the system is located on property dedicated to the county for recreation or other public purposes. An on-site or off-site reuse system, if constructed by the developer, must be in operation within one year of the approval of the first phase of the developer's development. 
                  (e)  Payment of all applicable reuse capital cost recovery fees shall be a precondition of issuance of a building permit.

                  Sec. 75-57. - Refunds of water connection service charge and/or sewer development fees paid. 
                  (a)  Failure to provide service. 
                  (1)  Any water connection service charge and/or sewer development fees paid shall be refunded to the feepayor if capacity is available and service is denied. 
                  (2)  In order to be eligible for a refund, a feepayor or successor in interest shall file a written application for a refund with the board of commissioners or their designee within one year of the date such fee was paid. If a successor in interest claims a refund of water connection service charge and/or sewer development fees, the board of commissioners or a designee may require written documentation that such rights have been conveyed to the claimant prior to issuing the requested refund. 
                  (3)  Refunds shall be paid within 60 days after the date on which the board of commissioners or their designee determines that a sufficient proof of claim for a refund has been made. 
                  (b)  Failure to initiate development. If a feepayor has paid a water connection service charge and/or sewer development fee required by this section and has obtained a building permit, and the building permit for which the fee was paid later expires or is abandoned without the possibility of further extension, then the feepayor or the feepayor's successor in interest shall not be entitled to a refund of water connection service charge and/or sewer development fees paid, but shall instead be entitled to credit for the present value of the water connection service charge and/or sewer development fee against future water connection service charge and/or sewer development fees for the same parcel of land. In order to be eligible to receive this credit for future water connection service charge and/or sewer development fees, the feepayor or a successor in interest shall be required to submit an application for such credit to the board of commissioners or a designee within 30 days after the expiration of the building permit for which the fee was paid. If a successor in interest claims a refund of water connection service charge and/or sewer development fees, the board of commissioners or a designee may require written documentation that such rights have been conveyed to the claimant prior to issuing the requested refund. 
                  (c)  Limitations. After a water connection service charge and/or sewer development fee has been paid pursuant to this ordinance [Appendix D], no refund of any part of such fee shall be made if the project for which the fee was paid is later demolished, destroyed, or is altered, reconstructed, or reconfigured so as to reduce the size of the project or the number of units in the project. 
                  (Ord. of 5-19-15) 
                  Sec. 75-58. - Credits against water connection service charge and/or sewer development fees. 
                  (a)  Credits to be issued. When a developer or his or her predecessor in title or interest has constructed system improvements for a county water or sewer capital facility element, or contributed or dedicated land or money towards the completion of water or sewer system improvements for a county capital facility element, and the county has accepted such construction, contribution, or dedication, the county may issue a credit against the water connection service charge and/or sewer development fees otherwise due for the same county capital facilities element in connection with the proposed development. 
                  (b)  Limitations. Credits against water connection service charge and/or sewer development fees shall not be given for (a) project improvements, or (b) any construction, contribution, or dedication not agreed to in writing by the county prior to commencement of said construction, contribution, or dedication. No agreement shall be effective unless it is reduced to writing by the board in open and public meeting, and recorded in the board's minutes. 
                  (c)  Valuation of credit at present value. 
                  (1)  Land. Credit for qualifying land dedications shall not exceed the fair market value established by a private appraiser acceptable to the county in an appraisal paid for by the feepayor. 
                  (2)  Improvements. The board of commissioners shall determine the amount of credit due in an amount not to exceed the actual cost of design and construction as reflected by invoices, receipts, or other proof acceptable to the board. The board may consider fair market value as determined by a qualified appraiser, replacement cost, depreciation, and any other information it deems relevant in determining the credit to be issued. 
                  (d)  When credits become effective. 
                  (1)  Approved credits for acquisition or construction of system improvements shall generally become effective when (a) all required design, permitting, construction, inspection, and testing has been completed and has been accepted by the county, (b) a suitable maintenance and warranty bond has been received and approved by the county, and (c) all land and infrastructure has been dedicated to and accepted by the board of commissioners in open and public meeting in compliance with all applicable requirements of the county and the State of Georgia. The land and/or improvements must be conveyed to the county in a form acceptable to the board, at no cost to the county, before credits may become effective. No dedication of land or improvements shall be deemed to have been accepted except upon affirmative action by the board, as reflected by its minutes, in open and public meeting. Upon request of the feepayor, the county shall issue a letter stating the amount of credit available. 
                  (e)  Application procedures. 
                  (1)  In order to obtain a credit against water connection service charge and/or sewer development fees otherwise due, a feepayor shall submit a written offer to dedicate to the board of commissioners or a designee for specific parcels of qualifying land or to contribute or construct specific improvements to the county capital facilities in accordance with all applicable state or county design and construction standards, and shall specifically request a credit against the type of water connection service charge and/or sewer development fees for which the land dedication or improvement is offered. Such written request shall be filed prior to the time the feepayor begins construction of any improvements for which credit is requested, or the claim for the credit shall be waived. If no improvements are to be constructed, e.g. the credit requested is for only land value, the written request shall be filed prior to the issuance of the first building permit that creates an obligation to pay the type of fee against which the credit is requested, or the claim for credit shall be waived. 
                  (2)  After receipt of the request for credit, the board of commissioners or a designee shall review the request and determine whether the land or improvements offered for credit will reduce the costs of providing county capital facilities by an amount at least equal to the value of the credit. If the board of commissioners or a designee determines that the offered credit satisfies these criteria, then the credit shall be issued. 
                  (f)  Transferability of credit. A credit may only be transferred by the developer that has received the credit to a successor in interest pursuant to the terms of this section. The credit may be used only to offset water connection service charge and/or sewer development fees for the same county capital facility element for which the credit was issued, and within the same service area for which the credit was issued. Credits shall be transferred by any written instrument clearly identifying which credits issued under this section are being transferred, the dollar amount of the credit being transferred, and the county capital facilities element and service area for which the credit was issued. The instrument of transfer shall be signed by both the transferor and transferee, and a copy of the document shall be delivered to the county administrator or a designee for documentation of the change in ownership before it shall become effective. 
                  (g)  Accounting of credits. Each time a request to use approved credits is presented to the county, the county shall reduce the amount of the water connection service charge and/or sewer development fees for the type of fee for which the credit is provided, and shall note in the county's records the amount of credit remaining, if any. Upon request of the feepayor or successor in interest to whom the credit was issued, the county shall issue a letter stating the amount of credit remaining. 
                  (h)  Credits exceeding fee amounts. 
                  (1)  Credits issued for one county capital facilities element may not be used to reduce water connection service charge and/or sewer development fees due for a different capital facilities element, or to reduce water connection service charge and/or sewer development fees in a different service area. 
                  (2)  Unless otherwise stated in an agreement with the developer, the county shall be under no obligation to use any county funds - other than water connection service charge and/or sewer development fees paid by other development for the same county capital facility element in the same service area - to reimburse the developer for any amount by which such developer's dedication, construction, funding, or contribution exceeds water connection service charge and/or sewer development fees otherwise due from such developer for any capital facilities element.

                  Sec. 75-153. - Purpose and policy. 
                  (a)  Generally. This article regulates the use of the county water and wastewater systems. 
                  (b)  Compliance with state and federal water pollution control laws. This article sets forth uniform requirements for persons who cause wastewater to be discharged into the wastewater collection and treatment system of the county and enables the county to comply with all applicable state and federal laws required by the Clean Water Act of 1977, as amended and the General Pretreatment Regulations (40 CFR 403), as amended. 
                  (c)  Objectives. The federally mandated objectives of this article are to: 
                  (1)  Prevent the introduction of pollutants into the county wastewater system which will interfere with the operation of the system or contaminate the resulting sludge; 
                  (2)  Prevent the introduction of pollutants into the county wastewater system which will pass through the system, inadequately treated, into receiving waters or the atmosphere, or otherwise be incompatible with the system; 
                  (3)  Improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewater and sludge from the system; and 
                  (4)  Provide for the equitable distribution of the cost of the county wastewater system. 
                  This article provides for the regulation of persons who cause wastewater to be discharged into the county wastewater system through the issuance of permits to certain non-domestic users and through enforcement activities, requires user reporting, assumes that existing customers' capacity will not be preempted and provides for the setting of fees for the equitable distribution of costs resulting from the operation and maintenance of the water and wastewater systems. 
                  (d)  Applicability. This article shall apply to the residents of the county and to all users of the county water and wastewater systems, including persons outside the county who are, by contract or agreement with the county, users of the county water or wastewater systems. Except as otherwise provided in this article the county water system director or his agent shall administer, implement and enforce the provisions of the article.

                  (a)  When the department director finds that a user has violated any provision of this article, a wastewater permit or order issued pursuant to this article or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the department director may serve upon that user a written notice of violation. Within 15 days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific actions, shall be submitted by the user to the department director. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the department director to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation. The offender shall, within the period of time stated in such notice, permanently cease all violation. 
                  (b)  Written notice personally delivered or placed in the U.S. mail to the person's last known address shall be deemed sufficient notice under this section. However, with respect to violations regarding nonpayment of amounts due under this article, only notice mailed to the person's last known address of the amount owed and the date upon which payment is due shall be required. Additionally, there shall be no prior notice requirement for violations of water use restrictions duly published in accordance with section 75-191. 
                  (c)  Repeat violations within a 12-month period shall be enforced in any manner subsequently described in this division or by any combination thereof.

                  Sec. 75-170. - Administrative orders and penalty. 
                  (a)  Compliance or administrative orders. When it is found that an industrial user has violated or continues to violate this article, or a permit or an order issued thereunder, the water system may issue an order to the industrial user responsible for the discharge directing that, following a specific time period, sewer service shall be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances have been installed and are properly operated. Orders may also contain such other requirements as might be reasonably necessary and appropriate to address the noncompliance, including the installation of pretreatment technology, additional self-monitoring and management practices. 
                  (b)  Cease and desist orders. When it is found that an industrial user has violated or continues to violate this article or a permit or order issued thereunder, the department director may issue an order to cease and desist all such violations and direct those persons in noncompliance to: 
                  (1)  Comply forthwith; and 
                  (2)  Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and terminating the discharge. 
                  (c)  Penalty. Notwithstanding any other section of this article, any user who is found to have violated any provision of this article or permits and orders issued pursuant to this article shall be fined in an amount not to exceed $1,000.00 per violation. Each day on which noncompliance shall occur or continue shall be deemed a separate and distinct violation. Such assessments may be added to the user's next scheduled sewer charge and the water system shall have such other collection remedies as necessary to collect these and other service charges. Unpaid charges, fines and penalties shall constitute a lien against the individual's property. Industrial users desiring to dispute such fines must file a request for the director to reconsider the fine within ten days of being notified of the fine. Where the water system director believes a request has merit, he shall convene a hearing on the matter within 15 days of receiving the request from the industrial user.

                  (a)  Any person violating the provisions of this article, discharge permit, federal or state pretreatment requirements or any order of the county board of commissioners shall be liable to the county for a maximum civil penalty under O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20 of $1,000.00 per violation per day. In the case of monthly or other longterm average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation. 
                  (b)  The department director may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses and the cost of actual damages incurred by the county. 
                  (c)  In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take into account all relevant circumstances including, but not limited to, extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user and any other factor as justice requires. 
                  (d)  Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a perquisite for, taking any other action against a user.

                  Sec. 75-179. - Affirmative defenses to discharge violations. 
                  (a)  For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance or careless or improper operation. 
                  (b)  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection (c) of this section are met. 
                  (c)  A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate through properly signed contemporaneous operating logs or other relevant evidence that: 
                  (1)  An upset occurred and the user can identify the causes of the upset. 
                  (2)  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures. 
                  (3)  The user has submitted the following information to the director within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days): 
                  a.  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
                  b.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times, or if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
                  c.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
                  (4)  In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall bear the burden of proof. 
                  (5)  Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
                  (6)  Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, is lost or fails. 
                  (7)  Prohibited discharge standards. A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in subsection 75-271(a) if it can prove that it did not know or have reason to know that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either: 
                  a.  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharge and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to and during the pass through or interference; or 
                  b.  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the county was regularly in compliance with NPDES permit and, in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.

                  Sec. 75-180. - Bypassing. 
                  (a)  Definitions. For the purposes of this section: 
                  Bypass means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a user's treatment facility. 
                  Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to treatment facilities which cause them to be inoperable, substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
                  (b)  Bypass that does not violate applicable pretreatment standards. An industrial user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it is also for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provisions of subsections (c) and (d) of this section. 
                  (c)  Notice. 
                  (1)  If the permittee knows in advance of the need for a bypass, he shall submit prior notice to the county, if possible, at least ten days before the date of the bypass.

                  (d)  Federal pretreatment standards. 
                  (1)  The federal government has adopted regulations governing wastewater discharges from industries into publicly owned wastewater treatment works (POTWs). These federal regulations are generally referred to as the federal pretreatment standards, or the Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards, as set forth in 40 CFR chapter 1, subpart n, parts 405—471. Any portion of these federal standards which are more strict than the regulations in this article are incorporated by reference, and such regulations may be enforced by the county. 
                  (2)  It is the affirmative obligation of all industrial users regulated by the federal pretreatment standards, inclusive of the Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards, to comply with the federal standards whether or not the industry has received notification from the county or any other jurisdiction of the existence and nature of the federal standards. 
                  (3)  Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass limits or either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the department director may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6. 
                  (4)  When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the department director shall impose an alternative limit using the combined waste stream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e). 
                  (5)  A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard if the user can prove pursuant to the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13 that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when developing the categorical pretreatment standards. 
                  (6)  A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15. 
                  (e)  Modifications to federal standards. 
                  (1)  From time to time, the federal government may alter existing federal pretreatment standards or promulgate new standards. None of the provisions contained in this Code shall prevent the timely implementation of new or altered federal standards by the industries to whom the new or altered standards apply. Where new or altered federal standards are more strict than the standards presently being imposed by the county, the county may, without prejudice, immediately revise any industrial wastewater discharge permits to reflect the new or altered standards. If the industrial user is unable to immediately conform to the new or altered standards, a reasonable schedule for compliance shall be provided by the department director. 
                  (2)  Where the county's wastewater treatment system achieves consistent removal of pollutants limited by federal pretreatment standards, the county may apply to the approval authority for modification of specific limits in the federal pretreatment standards. "Consistent removal" shall mean reduction in the amount of a pollutant or alteration of the nature of the pollutant by the wastewater treatment system to a less toxic or harmless state in the effluent which is achieved by the system in 95 percent of the samples taken when measured according to the procedures set forth in section 403.7(c)(2) of title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, part 403, "General Pretreatment Regulations for Existing and New Sources of Pollution," promulgated pursuant to the Clean Water Act, as amended. The county may then modify pollutant discharge limits in the federal pretreatment standards if the requirements contained in 40 CFR part 403, section 403.7, are fulfilled and prior approval from the state environmental protection division is obtained. 
                  (f)  County's right of revision. The county reserves the right to establish, by article or in wastewater discharge permits, more stringent standards or requirements on discharges to the POTW. 
                  (g)  Dilution. No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The water system director or his agent may impose mass limitations on users who are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.

                  (Ord. of 8-20-05, § 2-148.1) 
                  Sec. 75-280. - High strength wastewater surcharge. 
                  (a)  Establishment. 
                  (1)  All users discharging high strength wastewater into the county wastewater system shall be assessed a monetary surcharge, in addition to the normally required sewer use charges, in an amount to be calculated as shown below. "High strength wastewater" is defined as wastewater which contains the parameters and is in excess of concentrations as normally discharged by the average residence. These concentrations shall be determined by the water system and approved by the county board of commissioners. 
                  (2)  The parameters shall be determined by the utilization of the sampling and testing procedures as provided in section 75-275. Concentrations in excess of those set by the water system will be assessed a surcharge. The amount of the surcharge, which is hereby charged and assessed against all users discharging high strength wastewater into the county wastewater system, shall reflect the cost incurred by the county in handling the excess BOD, TSS, ammonia and total phosphorus. This surcharge shall include a proportionate share of charges for maintenance and operation of the wastewater treatment facilities, including depreciation and other incidental expenses. 
                  (3)  The current domestic limits and rates shall be on file and available at the office of the county clerk and at the office of the director of the county water system. 
                  (b)  Formula. When the concentrations of the surcharged parameters shown in this section exceed the values of the constituents as set forth in subsection (a) of this section, the excess concentrations shall be subject to a surcharge in the amount derived in accordance with the following formula: 
                  P X (G-R) × 8.34 × C = $/month 
                  Where: 
                  "P" is equal to the concentration in mg/l of the parameter being evaluated (BOD, TSS, ammonia, total inorganic phosphates or floatable oil and grease), which is in excess of the amounts shown in subsection (a) of this section. 
                  "G" is equal to the user's monthly water consumption in millions of gallons as determined from the user's monthly water meter or sewage flow meter readings. 
                  "R" is equal to the quantity of water in millions of gallons per month which is retained by the user, or that portion of water consumption which goes into the manufactured product or its production byproducts, or is otherwise disposed of by means other than into the county wastewater system. 
                  "8.34" is a conversion factor. 
                  "C" is equal to the unit cost in dollars per pound ($/lb.) for the treatment of the surcharged parameters. This value shall be established by the department director based on actual wastewater treatment costs which shall be revised from time to time as necessary. 
                  (c)  Quantitative measurement of surchargeable parameters. The measurement of the surcharge parameters (BOD, TSS, ammonia, total phosphorus) shall be conducted as follows: 
                  (1)  The county shall sample and test the user as provided in section 75-275 once per year, except that the duration of the sampling to determine surcharge shall be for a period of not less than five calendar days. 
                  (2)  The county need not provide any prior notice to the industry with regard to the sampling period. 
                  (3)  The county may sample the user as often as desired at the county's expense if, in the opinion of the county, representative samples have not been previously obtained. 
                  (4)  If, in the opinion of the user, the samples taken by the county are not representative of the user's typical wastewater, then the user may request up to two additional re-samplings. The user will be assessed a fee by the county which will be based on the actual costs to the county associated with re-sampling. The county may, but is not required to, provide the user with prior notice of the entry. 
                  (d)  Measurement of flow used in computing wastewater service charges and surcharges. The volumes of flow used in computing wastewater surcharges shall be based upon metered, estimated or prorated water consumption as shown in the records of meter reading maintained by the county water department. If a significant contributing industry discharging wastewater into the county wastewater system provides evidence to the county that a significant portion of the total annual volume of water used for all purposes does not reach the county wastewater system, an estimated percentage of total water consumption to be used in computing charges may be approved by the county. The estimated water usage which is retained by the significant contributing industry (not discharged to the wastewater system) shall be determined by an independent engineer acceptable to the county, who shall provide such analysis based on all available information. This retainage analysis shall then be submitted to the county by the significant industrial user to obtain proper credit for retainage to be credited against its surcharge and normal wastewater service charges. 
                  (e)  Perceived harm. Where a discharge causes harm or is perceived to cause harm to the POTW in violation of section 75-166, the director of the water system may void any rights to surcharge for high strength wastes and proceed with any enforcement.

                  Any industrial, commercial or institutional user of the county wastewater system will not be required to pay wastewater service charges for metered water which the customer does not return to the sewer, provided the following conditions are met: 
                  (1)  The user must have a retainage analysis conducted twice per year by an independent county engineering firm, which shall be selected by the county water system. The retainage analysis shall provide a value of retainage which will be a longterm average of the percentage of water used which is not returned to the sewer. 
                  (2)  The user shall pay the engineer's fees for the retainage analysis. 
                  (3)  The retainage analysis must bear the seal of the engineer who performed the analysis. 
                  (4)  The county water system may elect, at its sole discretion, to waive one of the two annual retainage analyses. 
                  (5)  The county reserves the right to dictate which months of the year the retainage analyses will be performed.

Before any land is subdivided the owner of the property proposed to be subdivided, or the authorized agent, shall apply for and secure approval of the proposed subdivision in accordance with the following procedures. The procedure for review and approval of a subdivision plat consists of the following sequential steps: 
                  (a)  Major subdivision. 
                  1.  Sketch plan 
                  2.  Preliminary plan 
                  3.  Final plat 
                  (b)  Minor subdivision. 
                  1.  Required items 
                  2.  Final plat 
                  Review and approval of preliminary plan for a major subdivision shall be completed prior to making any street improvement, installing any utilities or selling any lots. Final plat approval for a major or minor subdivision shall be completed prior to the sale of any lots in the proposed subdivision and subsequent to required improvements. 
                  Time frames for action by the planning board or county commission on a sketch plan, preliminary plan or final plat are based on the complete application of the required information for each stage. The professional staff of the planning and engineering department shall determine the completeness of an application as specified in these regulations and by the appropriate submittal forms as adopted by the county commission. Failure for the planning board or county commission to act on an incomplete application shall not constitute a violation of this or any other ordinance of the county. 
                  (Ord. of 4-18-06; Ord. of 5-5-09) 
                  4.2 - Review procedure. 
                  The following procedure shall be followed in the submission, review, and action upon all subdivision plats: 
                  4.2.1 Sketch plan review procedures for major subdivisions. 
                  (a)  Pre-application meeting. Before preparing the sketch plan for a subdivision, the applicant is strongly encouraged to schedule a meeting with the planning staff to discuss the procedure for approval and the requirements as to general layout of streets, required improvements, and similar matters. A subdivider must submit a sketch plan of the entire contiguous tract prior to the filing of a preliminary plan for all or a portion of the tract to be developed. 
                  Included with the sketch plan should be a sketch map that shows the subdivision in relation to the surrounding area. The purpose of the sketch plan is to assist the subdivider prior to extensive site planning necessary for the preparation of the preliminary plan, and to enable him or her to become familiar with the regulations affecting the land to be subdivided. 
                  (b)  Application procedure and requirements. Prior to subdividing land and after meeting with the planning staff, application for approval of a sketch plan shall be submitted to the professional staff of the planning and engineering department at least 19 days prior to the regularly scheduled meeting date of the planning board. The application shall: 
                  1.  Be made on forms available at the planning and engineering office; 
                  2.  Include all contiguous holdings of the owner with an indication of the portion proposed to be subdivided; 
                  3.  Be accompanied by one copy of the sketch plan no larger than 11 inches × 17 inches or ten copies if larger than 11 inches × 17 inches as described in these regulations and complying in all respects with these regulations; and, 
                  4.  The application shall include an address and telephone number of a local agent who shall be authorized to receive all notices required by these regulations. 
                  (c)  Classification and approval procedure. The planning staff shall determine whether the sketch plan constitutes a minor or major subdivision and notify the applicant of the classification within 19 days from the date that the sketch plan is submitted to the planning staff. If a parcel has a structure currently on the property at the time of the submittal, then the planning staff may, in his or her discretion, exempt the developed lot from counting as a lot in the subdivision for the purpose of classification as a major or minor subdivision. 
                  The sketch plan for a major subdivision shall then be placed on the next available regular meeting agenda of the planning board for formal approval, disapproval or conditional approval of the sketch plan. The planning board shall review the sketch plan and shall recommend approval, denial, or approval subject to modifications at the meeting at which it is presented. Pertinent comments and recommendations shall be recorded in the minutes of the planning board meeting. The planning board shall certify its recommendation to the board of commissioners, who shall consider the recommendation of the planning board and vote on the proposed sketch plan. 
                  1.  Major subdivision sketch plan. 
                  a.  Approval shall be granted only if the sketch plan complies with all applicable laws governing the subdivision of land in Effingham County. Subsequent to approval or conditional approval by the board of commissioners, the planning staff shall issue a notice to proceed to the applicant. The notice to proceed shall include, as appropriate, recommended changes in the sketch plan to be incorporated into the preliminary plan to assist the applicant in obtaining preliminary plan approval. 
                  i.  Upon approval, the sketch plan may be forwarded to the county engineer or designee, adjoining counties or municipalities, school board, or any other agency as deemed necessary. Such reviewers shall have ten business days to submit comments to the planning board. 
                  b.  The applicant shall have one year from the date that the sketch plan is approved by the board of commissioners to submit a preliminary plan, after which time a new sketch plan must be submitted for approval. 
                  4.2.2 Preliminary plan procedures for major subdivisions. 
                  (a)  Application procedure. Application for preliminary approval of a subdivision plat shall be submitted to the planning and engineering department. The application shall not be accepted until sketch plan approval has been granted. The application shall: 
                  1.  Be made on forms available at the planning and engineering office; 
                  2.  Include all contiguous holdings of the owner with an indication of the portion proposed to be subdivided; 
                  3.  The plat of the subdivision, construction drawings, hydrology reports, water/sewer calculations, land disturbing activity permit application and any other pertinent information shall be submitted as required by the planning and engineering department, as defined by section 5.2 of these regulations and the document "Effingham County Instructions for Subdivision Review." 
                  4.  Any preliminary plan submitted to the planning and engineering department shall contain the individual's name and address of the subdivider (or his designee) to whom notice comments may be sent. 
                  Additional copies of the plat and supplemental information may be requested by the professional staff. The above-mentioned copies shall be distributed as required by section 5.2.4 of these regulations and additionally as deemed necessary by the planning and engineering department. The person or agency to which a copy of the preliminary plan is directed shall indicate any desired changes or comments on the preliminary plan and submit said changes or comments to the planning and engineering department prior to the formal approval of the preliminary plan. 
                  (b)  Approval procedure. The preliminary plan shall be reviewed and approval from the departments as specified in section 5.2.4 of these regulations. The planning and engineering department, or designee, shall act on the preliminary plan within 90 days after formal submission, and, if recommending approval shall indicate in writing, stating the conditions of such approval, if any, or if recommending disapproval, shall express in writing its disapproval and its reasons therefore. Failure of the planning and engineering department, or designee, to act within 90 days after formal submission of the preliminary plan shall be deemed to constitute a recommendation of approval, and certificate to that effect shall be issued by said staff on demand; provided, however, that the subdivider may waive this requirement and consent in writing to the extension of such period. 
                  Failure of a subdivider to initiate any development within six months from the approval of the preliminary plan will require resubmission of a preliminary plan to the planning and engineering department for approval unless an extension is requested by the subdivider and approved by the county commission. 
                  Approval of a preliminary subdivision plan shall not constitute approval of the final subdivision plat. Preliminary approval shall constitute approval of the proposed widths and alignments of streets and the dimensions and shapes of lots subject to the final approval of the public works director or other designee of the board of commissioners. Application for approval of the final (record) plat will be considered only after the requirements for final plat approval as specified herein have been fulfilled and after all other specified conditions have been met. Upon approval of the preliminary subdivision plan by the professional staff, the subdivider may proceed to comply with the other requirements of these regulations, construction of the subdivision, and the preparation of the final subdivision plat. Construction shall follow the plans as submitted and approved by the county commission or their designee. A professional engineer licensed in the State of Georgia shall provide construction supervision.

Each sheet of the construction record drawings shall bear the stamp and signature of the professional engineer licensed in the State of Georgia who shall certify that the project has been constructed in accordance with the approved drawings. Inspection of the subdivision development shall be performed by the staff of the planning and engineering department, or designee, and all improvements required by this ordinance must be finished before the final plat application is deemed complete. Additional copies of the final plat and supplemental information may be requested. The above-mentioned copies shall be distributed as required by this ordinance and as deemed necessary by the planning and engineering staff. The person or agency to which a copy of the final plat is directed shall indicate any desired changes or comments, or its approval on the plat and shall submit it to the planning and engineering staff. 
                  (ii)  Application for final approval of a minor subdivision plat shall be submitted to the planning and engineering department. The application shall include the information specified in section 5.3 of these regulations. 
                  (b)  Approval procedure. 
                  (i)  For a major subdivision, the final plat shall be placed on the agenda of the next meeting of the county commission once the application is deemed complete by the planning and engineering staff, and following review and approval from the departments as specified in section 5.2.4 of these regulations. The applicant may petition to have an item placed on the agenda of the next meeting of the county commission prior to such approvals by submitting a written request to the planning and engineering department, specifying the reason for the request. Such requests shall be heard by the county commission and added to the county commission agenda upon unanimous approval. The board of commissioners shall act on the final plat within 60 days after formal submission. Failure to act within that time period shall be deemed to constitute final approval, and a certificate to that effect shall be issued upon demand; provided, however, that the subdivider may waive this requirement and consent in writing to the extension of such period. 
                  Upon the approval of the final plat by the board of commissioners, the original Mylar shall be stamped with the appropriate certificate of the board of commissioners. At least three prints shall then be made of the original, two to be kept on file with the planning and engineering department and one to accompany the original which shall be recorded in the office of the clerk of the Superior Court of Effingham County. Approval of the final plat shall be deemed to constitute or affect an acceptance by the county of the dedication of any street or other ground shown upon the plat that is intended to become public domain. 
                  In the event a final plat is disapproved, the subdivider shall be notified in writing, by certified mail, of the grounds for such disapproval. In no case shall a final plat be disapproved that: 
                  (a)  Meets the requirements of a final plat as set forth in these regulations; 
                  (b)  Conforms to an approved preliminary plan; and 
                  (c)  Has all the required improvements installed and approved. 
                  A subdivider who fails to initiate any development associated with the subdivision within 18 months from the approval of the preliminary plan shall be required to resubmit the preliminary plan to the planning and engineering department for approval. Any additional requirements placed upon the plan that were not placed upon the plan when it was first submitted shall be implemented in the final plan. All applicable fees shall be payable upon resubmission of the plat. 
                  All required improvements must be completed before the approval of the final plat. The maintenance bond, letter of credit (LOC), escrow account, or certified check will be held by the county for a period of not less than 12 months after final plat approval to assure the maintenance of the subdivision development. At the end of the 12 months, the developer shall request an inspection, and if no faults or failures have developed, the board of commissioners shall release the bond, LOC, escrow, or check. Maintenance bonds, LOCs, escrows, or checks shall remain in force until released by the board of commissioners after due inspection of said improvements and shall not automatically expire at the end of 12 months from the date of final plat approval. 
                  Where faults or failures develop and the subdivider is willing to make repairs at his cost, the county may allow him to do so. If the subdivider is not willing, the county may draw on any maintenance security given by the subdivider to ensure the maintenance of said improvements. The subdivider shall reimburse the county for all costs incurred by the county in maintaining said improvements, plus 100 percent of such costs as an administrative expense. In the event the amount of the letter of credit or other security is not sufficient to cover the total amount due the county, the subdivider shall immediately pay the balance due to the county. 
                  (ii)  For a minor subdivision, the final plat may be approved by the zoning administrator once the application is deemed complete by the planning and engineering staff, and following review and approval from the departments as specified in section 5.3.1 of these regulations. Upon review of a plat that complies with all of the requirements of the minor subdivision regulations including but not limited to zoning district, lot size, access, and frontage requirements, the original Mylar shall be signed by the zoning administrator. At least three prints shall then be made of the original, two to be kept on file with the planning and engineering department and one to accompany the original which shall be recorded in the office of the clerk of the Superior Court of Effingham County. 
                  The zoning administrator shall act on the plat within 30 days after formal submission. If approved, the plat shall be signed in the appropriate signature block. If recommending disapproval, an explanation in writing shall be attached to the plat. Failure of the zoning administrator to act within 30 days after formal submission of the required information shall be deemed to constitute approval; provided, however, that the subdivider may waive this requirement and consent in writing to the extension of such period.

                  5.1 - Sketch plan. 
                  An applicant must submit a sketch plan of the entire contiguous tract prior to the filing of a preliminary plan of the portion to be developed. If a sketch plan is not presented for the entire property, the property directly adjacent to the contiguous tract and under the same ownership not included in the sketch plan may not be subdivided for 24 months following the approval of the final plat of the original contiguous property. 
                  The purpose of a sketch plan is to provide both the applicant and the county an opportunity to review the proposed development before significant financial resources have been invested. Therefore, the sketch plan does not require the certification of an engineer, surveyor, or other professional. Existing features, including water bodies, wetlands, and flood zone limits, are required to be surveyed for the sketch plan. 
                  If an applicant chooses to utilize professional resources (engineer, surveyor, etc.) in preparation of the sketch plan, this shall in no way obligate the county to approve such plans based on the expenditure of time or resources premature to sketch plan approval. 
                  5.1.1 Scale. The sketch plan shall be drawn at a scale of not less than 100 feet to one inch. 
                  5.1.2 Vicinity map. The sketch plan shall include a vicinity map at a scale of approximately one inch equals one mile showing the relationship of the proposed subdivision to surrounding development.

                  5.4.2.1 Subdivision corner tie. 
                  (1)  At least one corner of the subdivision shall be designated by course and distance (tie) from a readily discernible reference marker. If a corner is within 2,000 feet of a U.S. Coast and Geodetic Station, U.S. Geological Survey, or Georgia Grid System coordinated monument, then this corner shall be marked with a monument so designated by computed X and Y coordinates which shall appear on the map with a statement identifying this station or monument to an accuracy of 1:10,000. When such a monument or station is not available, the tie shall designate a reference marker and the X and Y coordinates shall be obtained using sub-meter Global Positioning System (GPS) technology. All subdivision surveys shall be tied to the target coordinate system. 
                  (2)  The target coordinate system is Georgia State Plane, East Zone, North American Datum (NAD) 1983. All survey tie monuments shall reference this coordinate system. 
                  5.4.2.2 Monuments. 
                  (1)  Monuments shall be located in the ground at all angles in the boundaries of the subdivision; at the intersection of the lines of streets with boundaries of the plat and at the intersection of alleys with the boundaries of the subdivision; at all points of curvature, points of tangency, points of reverse curvature, and angle points in the side lines of streets and alleys; and at all angles of an intermediate transverse line. 
                  (2)  It is not intended or required that monuments be placed within the traveled portion of a street to marker angles in the boundary of the subdivision if the angle points can be readily re-established by reference to monuments along the sidelines of the streets.

                  ARTICLE VI. - REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS 

                  6.1 - Number of lots vs. improvement standards. 

                   
                  (Ord. of 4-18-06) 
                  6.2 - Required improvements. 
                  A well-designed subdivision means little to a prospective lot buyer until he can see actual physical transformation of raw land into lots with all necessary improvements provided. Likewise, a well-designed subdivision is not an asset to the community until the necessary improvements have been installed. In order that prospective lot purchasers may get useable products and new subdivisions may be an asset rather than a liability to the community, the subdivider shall install and/or pay for the improvements required by these regulations necessary to serve his subdivision prior to the approval of the final plat. 
                  6.2.1 Natural gas. When gas lines are located in a street right-of-way, where possible, such lines shall be located outside the portion of the street to be surfaced to prevent having to cut into the paved surface to serve abutting properties. 
                  6.2.2 Water supply. If a water system is installed in a subdivision, water mains, valves, and fire hydrants shall be installed according to plans approved by and in accordance with the rules and administrative regulations of the county. When the water main is located in the street surface to serve the abutting lots, a connection shall be stubbed out to the property line to serve each lot before the street is surfaced. Major subdivisions and phased development shall provide a water supply master plan for the entire development. 
                  6.2.3 Sanitary sewerage. If sanitary sewer is installed in a subdivision, sanitary sewers shall be installed to the plans and specifications approved by and in accordance with the rules and administrative regulations of the public works department or other designee of the board of commissioners. When the sewer line is located in a street right-of-way and it will be necessary to cut into the street surface to serve the abutting lots, a connection shall be stubbed out to the property line to serve each lot prior to surfacing the street. Major subdivisions and phased developments shall provide a sewer master plan for the entire development. 
                  6.2.4 Sewage disposal systems. Prior to the construction of any community sewerage disposal system such as private septic tanks, an oxidation pond, or other facility, the location, size, plans, and specifications of such a facility shall be approved by and be in accordance with the rules and administrative regulations of the planning board and the public works department or other designee of the board of commissioners. Major subdivisions and phased developments shall provide a sewer master plan for the entire development. 
                  6.2.5 Curbs and gutters. If concrete curbs or paved valley-type gutters are required, they shall be installed in accordance with plans and specifications approved by the public works department or other designee of the board of commissioners. 
                  6.2.6 Street grading and surfacing. Street grading, base preparation, and surfacing shall be carried out by the subdivider according to plans and specifications approved by the public works department or other designee of the board of commissioners and meeting the specifications and requirements of the Effingham County. The subdivider shall provide a written guarantee to the county public works guaranteeing the construction of all new roads within a subdivision for one year following the construction of said roads. 
                  6.2.7 Storm drainage. An adequate drainage system that is compliant with the Effingham County Water Resources Protection Ordinance and the Stormwater Management Local Design Manual, to include necessary open ditches, pipes, culverts, storm sewers, intersectional drains, drop inlets, bridges, and other necessary appurtenances shall be installed by the subdivider according to plans and specifications approved by the public works department or other designee of the board of commissioners. 
                  (a)  A storm drainage plan shall be prepared for the entire site proposed for subdivision based on anticipated post-development conditions. 
                  (b)  Retention/detention facilities shall be provided to maintain a post-development runoff rate equal to or less than the pre-development runoff rate with adequate emergency overflow structure to discharge the 100-year storm event without overtopping. 
                  (c)  Drainage structures, including ponds and ditches, shall be placed within an easement. The easement shall be of adequate width to allow for the access of maintenance equipment, with a minimum width of 12 feet on one side of the structure. 
                  (d)  Percolation through swales or other pervious surfaces is preferred to direct discharge of stormwater. Swales cannot intersect driveways. 
                  (e)  Maintaining the existing tree canopy and other existing vegetation is encouraged and may be included in calculations of runoff rates and retention/detention facilities. 
                  6.2.8 Street names and traffic control signs. The location and design of street name signs and traffic control signs shall be approved by the public works department or other designee of the board of commissioners in accordance with rules and regulations adopted by the board of commissioners and the Georgia Department of Transportation. The developer shall pay for the cost of such signs. 
                  All street name and traffic control signs must meet minimum retroreflectivity requirements as stated in the current Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) Sec. 2A.09 in addition to all other MUTCD standards for sign size and location. 
                  The developer may either purchase signs from the county or must prove that signs purchased elsewhere meet the above standards. 
                  6.2.9 Street lights and poles. Installation of street lights and poles shall be carried out by the subdivider and be approved by the appropriate electric power company. This requirement may be waived by the county commission for residential subdivisions of lots five acres or more. 
                  6.2.10 Topsoil. Topsoil shall not be removed from residential lots or used as spoil, but shall be redistributed so as to provide at least six inches of cover on the lots and at least four inches of cover between sidewalks and curbs, and shall be stabilized by seeding or planting. The excavation and treatment of overburden during construction shall be inspected by the soil and water conservationist. 
                  6.2.11 Major subdivision access. In a major subdivision, access to lots not fronting on existing county roads must be provided by the developer with a minimum 60-foot right-of-way. Additional right-of-way above the 60-foot minimum may be recommended by the planning board and required by the county commission if: [(1)] streets within a subdivision will eventually provide access to adjoining property; or (2) the county engineer determines that, due to cut and fill requirements or location of utilities, additional right-of-way is needed above the minimum. Preparation and maintenance of the access road will be the responsibility of the developer until accepted by Effingham County for maintenance. 
                  6.2.12 Minor subdivision access or subdivision of three lots or less. Lots in a minor subdivision or subdivision of three lots or less shall be served by a public street. The county commission may allow a private access road with the following conditions: 
                  1.  A private unpaved road with a minimum easement of 60 feet in width may serve no more than three lots, including the remaining tract, in a single-family residential zoning district. 
                  2.  The subject property may not have been rezoned subsequent to the adoption of this revision. 
                  3.  The land to be divided existed as a lot of record on the effective date of these regulations and has not been subdivided since the effective date of this these regulations. 
                  4.  It is unlikely, because of existing development, natural features, or other conditions, that the private road will be extended or otherwise connect with an existing or future street or serve other adjacent properties. 
                  5.  One of the lots within the subdivision abuts on a public street. This lot shall be included as one of the three lots. This requirement may be waived if the parcel to be subdivided is currently served by a private road at the time of the adoption of these regulations. 
                  6.  The private access road shall intersect with an existing public street. 
                  7.  Lots served by a private access road may not be re-subdivided unless the private road is upgraded to county street standards. 
                  8.  The plat of each lot served by a private easement shall state the following: "This lot is served by a private road, not to be maintained by Effingham County nor accepted as a public road unless such road, at the property owner's expense, is brought in compliance with county standards as specified by Effingham County, including, but not limited to, paving. This lot may not be re-subdivided until said road, at the subdivider's expense, is brought into compliance with county road standards to be accepted as a public road by the Effingham County Board of Commissioners." This statement shall also be recorded in a covenant to be recorded in the deed of each lot. 
                  6.2.13 Access to state and federal highways. If a road can be provided for lots, then a road shall be required, rather than permitting the stripping of lots along the road frontage with individual and direct access to the roadway. 
                  6.2.14 Speed limits. Unless otherwise provided herein or by ordinance, the speed limit in all subdivisions shall be 25 miles per hour. The location of speed limit signs shall be approved by the public works director. The subdivider shall reimburse Effingham County for the cost of erecting speed limit signs throughout the subdivision as deemed necessary for public safety. 
                  6.2.15 Utilities. All utilities shall be underground. This requirement may be waived by the county commission for subdivisions in an AR-1 zoning district. 
                  (Ord. of 4-18-06; Ord. of 1-3-11, § 1) 
                  6.3 - Final plat revisions. 
                  If it should become necessary to revise a final plat due to a dimensional error, a revised plat shall be submitted to the clerk of the superior court for final recording after the planning staff has approved and signed the revised plat. 
                  (Ord. of 4-18-06) 
                  6.4 - Letters of credit. 
                  (a)  In order to assure the maintenance of required improvements and installations after the approval of a final plat, the board of commissioners may accept a commitment of the subdivider to maintain said improvements, for a time specified by the board, or security in the form of an irrevocable letter of credit, maintenance bond, escrow account, or certified check, in an amount established by the board as sufficient to pay all costs of maintaining said improvements. 
                  (b)  In all cases in which a subdivider posts any form of security for the maintenance of subdivision improvements after the approval of a final plat, said subdivider shall pay to the county a nonrefundable administrative fee in the amount of $100.00. 
                  (Ord. of 4-18-06; Ord. of 5-5-09) 
                  6.5 - Dedications. 
                  The county commission shall not improve, grade, pave, or light any street or authorize the laying of water mains, sewer connections, or other public facilities or utilities in any street within the territorial jurisdiction of the county unless such street has been accepted or opened as, or shall otherwise have received the legal status of, a public street. 
                  6.5.1 Acceptance of existing roads and streets. Any street existing at the date of these regulations that is a private road or street may be presented by the owners to the county commission for acceptance as a public street, provided the street meets the following conditions: 
                  1.  Constructed to county standards and in good condition according to such standards. Dirt roads shall be paved at the owner's expense; 
                  2.  Drainage complies with the Effingham County Water Resource Protection Ordinance and the Stormwater Management Local Design Manual;

                  1.  Any street constructed after the date of this ordinance must be constructed to county standards. The subdivider may request the dedication of new streets after such roads or streets have been utilized for a period of one year or more after the date of the approval of the final plat by the county commission. The county commission may accept a road or street prior to this date if a performance bond or letter of credit is posted for one year to ensure the condition of the street in the amount of 150 percent of the cost of the street. The county commission may also request a letter or credit or performance bond upon acceptance of the street if deemed necessary based on the condition of the street. 
                  2.  Any road which is initially constructed as a private road may be presented to the county commission for dedication if such road meets all county standards. The road must be paved at the applicant's expense prior to acceptance by the county commission. Such road must meet all requirements as detailed in section 6.5.1 of this article. 
                  (Ord. of 4-18-06) 
                  6.6 - Resubdivision. 
                  Any lot in a residential zoning district that is ten acres or less and that was previously approved by the board of commissioners as part of a subdivision of four or more lots and recorded in the office of the superior court clerk cannot be resubdivided except with the approval of the board of commissioners, after giving consideration to the following factors: 
                  Whether the size of the proposed lots is compatible with the size of the lots created by the previously approved subdivision, 
                  Whether the intended use of the property as previously subdivided has been frustrated by changing economic conditions, by the exercise of eminent domain, or other circumstances, 
                  Whether the proposed resubdivision will adversely affect the values of other property within the previously platted subdivision in which the property is located, and 
                  Whether the proposed resubdivision is compatible with the purposes of the Effingham County subdivision regulations. 
                  Parcels that are zoned as commercial and industrial would be exempt from these regulations. 
                  (Ord. of 4-18-06; Ord. of 5-15-07) 
                  ARTICLE VII. - DESIGN STANDARDS 
                  The following design standards shall be considered minimum requirements in the platting of all subdivisions: 
                  (Ord. of 4-18-06) 

                  7.1 - Streets and roads. 
                  7.1.1 Conformity to existing maps or plans. The location and width of all proposed streets shall be in conformity with official plans and maps and with existing amended plans of the planning board. 
                  7.1.2 Continuation of adjoining street system. The proposed street layout shall be coordinated with the street system of the surrounding area. Where possible, existing major streets shall be extended. 
                  7.1.3 Access to adjacent properties. Proposed streets shall be extended by dedication to the boundary of such property and a temporary turnaround shall be provided, unless prevented by topography, other physical conditions, or unless in the opinion of the planning board such extension is not necessary or desirable for the coordination of the layout of the subdivision with the existing layout or the most advantageous for future development of adjacent tracts. Where future extension of streets is desirable, streets shall be extended to the boundary of the subdivision and the resulting dead-end streets may be approved without a turnaround upon approval by the planning board and county commission. Street plugs may be required to preserve the objectives of street extensions. 
                  7.1.4 Street names. Proposed streets which are obviously in alignment with other existing and named streets shall bear the assigned name of the existing streets. In no case shall the name of the proposed streets duplicate or be phonetically similar to existing street names, irrespective of the use of suffix, street, avenue, boulevard, drive, place, court, etc. It shall be unlawful for any person in laying out any new street or road to name such street or road on any plat, by marking, or in any deed or instrument, without first getting approval of the planning board. 
                  7.1.5 Local streets. Minor streets shall be so laid out that their use by through traffic will be discouraged. 
                  7.1.6 Trees. As many trees as possible shall remain on the site during the initial clearing and grading and all healthy trees, as determined by an arborist or other tree professional, having a trunk diameter of six inches or more, measured four feet above the ground, shall remain unless they lie within a planned public right-of-way, within a planned building site, or within the necessary paved areas surrounding or adjacent to the primary structure. 
                  7.1.7 Railroads and highways (freeways, expressways). Railroad rights-of-way and limited access highways where so located as to affect the subdivision of adjoining lands shall be treated as follows: 
                  (a)  In residential districts, a buffer strip not less than 25 feet in depth in addition to the normal depth of the lot required in the district shall be provided adjacent to the railroad right-of-way or limited access highway. This strip shall be part of the platted lots and shall be so designated on the plat: "This strip is reserved for the planting of trees and shrubs by the owner. The placement of structures hereon is prohibited." 
                  (b)  In districts zoned for business, commercial, or industrial uses, the nearest street extending parallel or approximately parallel to the railroad shall, wherever practicable, be at a sufficient distance there from to ensure suitable depth for commercial or industrial sites. 
                  (c)  All other streets which are parallel to the railroad, when intersecting a street which crosses the railroad at grade, shall, to the extent practicable, be at a distance of at least 150 feet from the railroad right-of-way. Such distance shall be determined with due consideration of the minimum distance required for future separation of grades by means of appropriate approach gradients. 
                  7.1.8 Reserved strips and street plugs. Reserved strips parallel to a new street shall be prohibited. Street plugs at the terminus of a street or adjacent to a street shall be created to control access onto any street which terminates upon any undeveloped land through which the street might logically extend. In such cases, the street shall be provided to within one foot of the boundary line of the tract with the remaining one foot being dedicated to the county as a part of said street. This dedication will be automatic and without further action by the county. The connection to existing streets via street plugs shall be the responsibility of the developer of the adjoining property.

Failure to notify each such lot purchasers shall constitute violation of this chapter. 
                  (4)  A private street or road may be dedicated to and accepted by the county for public street purposes, provided such private street or road meets the minimum design and construction standards for the county.

                  When, due to a particular hardship experienced by an owner of a tract of land such as inadequate size, shape, drainage, etc., it is impractical for a developer to comply with these regulations, the board of commissioners may vary such requirements provided the intent and purpose of these regulations are not violated. The board of commissioners shall not grant such variances unless it finds based on the evidence presented to it in each specific case that: 
                  a.  The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public safety, health, or welfare or injurious to other property, and; 
                  b.  The conditions upon which the request is based are unique to the property for which the relief is sought and are not applicable generally to other property, and; 
                  c.  Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape, or topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the strict letter of these regulations is carried out, and; 
                  d.  The relief sought will not in any manner vary the provisions of the zoning ordinance or comprehensive plan, except that those documents may be amended in the manner prescribed by law.

                  ARTICLE III. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 

                  3.1 - Abandoned real property. 
                  3.1.1  For any public street or alley which is hereafter officially vacated or abandoned, the regulations applicable to each parcel of abutting property shall apply to the centerline of the property which is abandoned. In the event abandoned property is not divided at the centerline for abutting properties, the zoning districts applicable shall apply to such ownership line as determined by virtue of such abandonment. 
                  3.1.2  For any public property other than streets or alleys, the regulations applicable to the zoning classification which abuts the abandoned property for the greatest number of linear feet shall apply to the entire property. 
                  3.2 - Abandoned vehicles. 
                  Within all zoning districts, except where specifically authorized, all vehicles which are inoperative and/or unlicensed shall not be abandoned in the public right-of-way or on private property in excess of 30 days during any consecutive 120-day period, except within a completely enclosed garage or other structure. For purposes of this section, the term "vehicle" includes farm and commercial vehicles, machinery, and equipment. 
                  (Ord. of 12-15-92) 
                  3.3 - Accessory buildings in residential districts. 
                  No accessory building in residential districts shall be erected in any required court or any yard other than a rear yard, except as provided hereafter. An accessory building may be erected as part of a principal building or, if at least six feet therefrom, may be connected thereto by a breezeway or similar structure, provided all yard requirements of this ordinance for a principal building are complied with. 
                  3.3.1 Setbacks for accessory buildings. Accessory buildings shall be a distance at least five feet from rear property lines, and interior side setbacks shall be ten feet. 
                  (Ord. of 2-19-91) 
                  3.4 - Buffers. 
                  Purpose and function: To provide minimum separation and screening of different land uses. To minimize the adverse effects of commercial and industrial land uses on surrounding property; to act as a filtration zone for stormwater; to make the environment more visually attractive; and to preserve the tree canopy in the county. 
                  It is the intent of this ordinance that buffers be maintained and controlled so that the effects of the screening are not diminished. 
                  3.4.1 Buffer Design Standards: 
                  A.  Plant material: Existing plant materials including understory vegetation in buffers shall be maintained whenever possible. AH trees over six inches diameter at breast height (dbh) shall be retained. Additional planting may be required when existing plant material is inappropriate for screening. Additional landscaping may be added at the property owner's discretion. 
                  B.  Structural elements: Structural elements such as fences, walls, and berms may be placed in buffers. When privacy fences or walls are located in a buffer, a minimum of two feet from the exterior property line will be maintained to allow for plant material to soften the affects of the structural element. 
                  C.  Encroachment: Buffer areas should remain natural. There shall be no encroachment of structures, including eaves or paving, in buffer areas. 

                   
                  * Subdivisions of less than five lots are exempt from buffer requirements when neighboring property is under the same ownership. 
                  **Adjacent Commercial, Institutional, and Industrial developments which are designed as a single development or share parking may reduce the buffer width by up to 50 percent between these parcels. If commercial property is developed with zero lot lines then the buffer between parcels shall be eliminated. At no time may buffers be reduced between Commercial, Institutional, or Industrial and Residential uses. 
                  ***Industrial surface mines will follow the buffer requirements in section 3.17.4. 
                  3.4.2 Adjacent public street buffers: All development excluding industrial development shall maintain a ten-foot wide landscaped buffer between any parking or loading area and an adjacent accessed public right-of-way (ROW). In single family subdivisions a ten-foot landscaped buffer must be maintained between any lot or internal street and any public collector or arterial ROW accessed from the subdivision. 
                  Where parcels abut a street without access to that street the buffer on that side of the parcel shall equal the required buffer for the use on the other side of the street in the above chart. 
                  Street buffers for industrial property shall equal the required buffer for the use on the other side of the street in the above chart. 
                  PDs may have different buffer requirements. Please refer to PD ordinance. 
                  3.4.2 Adjacent public street buffers: All development shall maintain a ten-foot wide landscaped buffer between any parking or loading area and an adjacent accessed public right-of-way (ROW). In single-family subdivisions a ten-foot landscaped buffer must be maintained between any lot or internal street and any public collector or arterial ROW accessed from the subdivision. 
                  Where parcels abut a street without access to that street the buffer on that side of the parcel shall equal the required buffer for the use on the other side of the street in the above chart. 
                  PDs may have different buffer requirements. Please refer to PD ordinance. 
                  3.4.3 Permitted activity in required buffers as shown in chart 3.4.1: 
                  A.  Drainage ditches, utility and service lines provided that they are approximately perpendicular to the property line. 
                  B.  Street and rail access, and driveways provided that they are approximately perpendicular to the property line. 
                  C.  Sidewalks and pathways that connect multiple parcels. 
                  D.  Lighting fixtures. 
                  E.  Signs. 
                  F.  Flagpoles. 
                  3.4.4 Specific buffer requirements: 
                  A.  Buffers for adjacent vacant property. When determining buffers for adjacent property, the property shall be classified based on the use allowed by right in the existing zoning district that would require the greatest buffer. 
                  B.  Buffers at property line easement. When a shared easement is located on a property line the required buffer shall be located on each side of the shared easement. 
                  3.4.5 Required plant material: 
                  A.  Where trees do not already exist they must be planted at a rate of one tree, at least two inches dbh, every 30 linear feet of buffer. The following list specifies recommended trees for this area. For buffers greater than 30 feet in depth required tree planting must come from the large tree list. 
                  B.  Buffers in industrial zones must include understory plantings at a rate of on three gallon plant every five linear feet if sufficient understory foliage does not exist. 

                   

                   
                  Medium Canopy Trees: (Count for 550 square feet of area for planting—minimum two inches caliber)

                  3.5 - Buildings on through lots. 
                  Where a lot extends through from one street to another, the setback requirement for each such street shall be complied with and any building shall have dual facing. No accessory building or other structure shall be placed on through lots if said structures would conflict with other building values or uses on the same street. On lots having frontage on more than two streets, the minimum front yard shall be provided in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance on at least two of the street frontages. 
                  3.6 - Cemeteries, mausoleums, and crematories.

                  3.7A - Conditional zoning. 
                  3.7A.1.  In deciding any application for an amendment to the zoning classification of a parcel of property or to the zoning map, the board of commissioners may, on their own motion or upon the recommendation of the planning board or the zoning administrator, grant the application subject to certain conditions deemed necessary by the board to promote and protect the health, safety, morality, and welfare of the county and to further the purposes of this ordinance. Such provisions shall be imposed for the benefit of the community to prevent or lessen any negative impact expected to result from the zoning reclassification or zoning map amendment. 
                  3.7A.2.  Conditions that may be adopted include, but are not limited to, conditions as to buffers, preservation of existing vegetation and tree cover, maximum density and/or number of lots, minimum lot size, setback restrictions, and property use restrictions.

                  It is the intent of Effingham County Board of Commissioners through the regulations of this article to provide separate areas for mobile home development. Separate areas are provided because mobile homes are constructed to different design standards than conventional dwelling units and the mixture of the two in close proximity has a destabilizing effect on both housing types. Separate areas for mobile home development also allow for greater density than is allowed in other residential districts. 
                  Uses permitted by right include mobile home parks and mobile home subdivisions. Mobile home parks are developments in which individual mobile home pads are rented, leased or held in condominium ownership by occupants. Mobile home subdivisions are developments in which mobile home lots are individually owned as in conventional single-family subdivisions. 
                  Recreational vehicle parks are permitted as conditional uses. It is the intent of this Code that recreational vehicle park facilities may not be mixed with mobile home parks or with mobile home subdivisions. 
                  Development regulations in the mobile home district are intended to provide a reasonably spacious and well-designed environment which offers a desirable level of amenity.

The board of commissioners may revoke permission for any proposed event or order that an event be discontinued immediately if, in the sole judgement of the board of commissioners, the event will disrupt traffic within the unincorporated area of Effingham County beyond practical solution; the event will interfere with access to fire stations and fire hydrants; the event will require the diversion of so many public employees that allowing the event would unreasonably deny service to remainder of the county; or the event might otherwise interfere with the welfare, peace, safety, health, good order and convenience of the general public. 
                  (3)  Exemptions. The following special events are exempt from the provisions of this article:

The board of commissioners may determine that a proposed activity is similar to those uses listed within section 5.12.1 or that the use is not similar. If the proposed activity is considered to be a similar use, said activity may be permitted by right. If the proposed activity is not similar to those uses listed within section 5.1.11, the use shall be subject to the approval of the county commission after review and recommendation by the planning board, subject to such conditions deemed necessary and appropriate by the board to protect the public health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of Effingham County and to promote the purposes of this chapter. The planning board and board of commissioners may employ experts in specific fields as needed, and as funds are available, to determine whether a proposed use meets the required performance standards.

The planning board may suggest disapproval, recommend the plan as submitted, or may modify, alter, adjust, or amend the plan before recommendation, and in recommending it, may propose the prescribing of other conditions. The report of the planning board to the county commission shall include a finding as to whether the proposed use is consistent with the provisions and requirements of the zoning ordinance. If the county commissioners find that the proposed use is consistent with the purpose of the zoning ordinance to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, it may approve the rezoning. 
                  5.12.4 Performance standards. All industrial uses must conform to the following performance standards: 
                  5.12.4.1 Smoke. The emission from any air contaminant source the opacity of which is equal to or greater than 40 percent shall not be permitted. Furthermore, from fuel-burning equipment, visible emissions the opacity of which is equal to or greater than 20 percent, except for one six-minute period per hour of not more than 27 percent opacity, shall not be permitted. Any operation, process, handling, transportation, or storage facility which may result in fugitive dust shall take all reasonable precautions to prevent such dust from becoming airborne. The percent opacity from any fugitive dust source shall not equal or exceed 20 percent. "Opacity" means the degree to which emissions reduce the transmission of light and obscure the view of an object in the background, and is expressed in terms of percent opacity. The measurement of percent opacity does not include the measurement of the obscuration of view due to uncombined water droplets. Any determination of the percent opacity shall be made by the arithmetic average of six minutes of data. 
                  Any visual observation or determination of opacity taken for the purpose of determining compliance with any requirement of this standard shall be made by personnel certified according to procedures established for such certification by the Georgia EPD or by US EPA to make such observation or determination. 
                  5.12.4.2 Odor. Any process which may involve the creation or emission of any odors shall be provided with a secondary safeguard system, so that control will be maintained if the primary safeguard system should fail. There is hereby established as a guide in determining such quantities of offensive odors Table 3 (Odor Thresholds) in Chapter 5, Air Pollution Abatement Manual, copyright 1951, by Manufacturing Chemists Association, Inc., Washington, D.C. Where said publication gives range of figures a simple average of these shall be used. 
                  5.12.4.3 Toxic gases. The emission of gases or fumes injurious to persons or property beyond the lot lines occupied by the use is prohibited. 
                  5.12.4.4 Glare and heat. Glare and heat from arc welding, acetylene torch cutting, or similar processes shall be performed so as not to produce glare which is visible, or objectionable heat beyond the property line of the lot on which the operation is located. Direct glare from incandescent exposed lights shall not be visible from adjoining streets or properties. All lighting shall be downward facing and shielded. 
                  5.12.4.5 Wastewater. No discharge is permitted at any point in any private sewage disposal system or stream or into the ground of any materials in such a way or of such nature or temperature as could contaminate any water supply, or otherwise cause the emission of dangerous objectionable elements, except in accordance with the standards as approved by water pollution control boards of appropriate agencies of the state department of natural resources. 
                  Furthermore, no accumulation of solid wastes conducive to the breeding of rodents or insects shall be permitted. 
                  5.12.4.6 Storage of toxic or hazardous wastes, chemicals, and materials. Any applicant who intends to store, handle, or transport toxic or hazardous waste, chemicals, or materials shall submit to the county fire marshal a listing of all compounds and contents to be contained on the proposed site. Upon approval by the county fire marshal that the use, transport, and storage of said materials meets the federal and state guidelines, the applicant shall be issued a permit authorizing such secured storage. Disposal of toxic or hazardous wastes, chemicals, and materials is prohibited. 
                  5.12.4.7 Vibration. Any use creating intense earthshaking vibration shall be set back as far as possible from the lot lines on all sides, and in no case shall any such vibration be perceptible along any lot line. 
                  5.12.4.8 Buffer/screening. Please refer to buffer ordinance. 
                  5.12.5 Uses prohibited. 
                  1.  Residential subdivisions 
                  2.  Single-family residences

                  5.15 - PD Planned development district. 
                  It is the intent of this section that the PD zoning district be reserved for the establishment and continuance of shopping centers, residential developments, industrial parks, medical centers and similar types of large-scale, compatible use developments. The regulations which apply within this district are designed to encourage the formation of such planned developments when appropriate and to permit the greatest latitude possible with respect to: 
                  1)  Internal site planning considerations; and 
                  2)  The location of these developments within the unincorporated portions of Effingham County in the best interest of comprehensive development plans of the county. 
                  5.15.1 Eligibility requirements. 
                  5.15.1.1 The site utilized for planned development must contain an area of not less than the following: 

                   
                  Any proposed planned development with a combination of any of the above will be subject to the most restrictive land area requirement of the above listed single uses. 
                  5.15.1.2 The site must have a minimum width, between any two opposite boundary lines of 300 linear feet and must adjoin or have direct, adequate access (as defined by the Highway Capacity Manual, most current edition), to at least one improved public road as shown on the Effingham County Road Classification Map. 
                  5.15.1.3 There is hereby established the requirement that development projects as determined by the planning board staff, will submit a developments of regional impact report for review by staff. All projects whether subject to the regional impact review or not, will follow the procedures outlined by the Georgia Department of Community Affairs, Chapter 110-12-3, Developments of Regional Impact (DRI), which must be completed and submitted to the zoning office for review, before local government action related to the project occurs. This will include but not be limited to the completion of Form 1: Initial DRI Information, and if required Form 2: DRI Review Initiation Request for those projects meeting the minimum threshold requirements. Based upon review of the information provided and comments received from state and/or local agencies, planning board staff may request that the applicant provide additional information to complete their review before the eligibility requirements are met and the rezoning request is brought before the planning board. 
                  5.15.1.4 The area proposed shall be in one ownership, or if in several ownerships, the application for amendment to the Zoning Ordinance shall be filed jointly by all of the owners of the properties included in the plan. 
                  5.15.1.5 The requirements of the PD zoning district will hereafter apply to planned unit development rezoning request currently under the review of Effingham County. 
                  5.15.2 Procedure for Creating and Maintaining a PD District. 
                  5.15.2.1 Any request pertaining to the establishment of a PD district shall be considered a proposal for amendment to the Zoning Ordinance and shall be processed in accordance with the regulations set forth in Article IX of Appendix C of the Effingham County Code (hereafter Appendix C), with regards to application requirements, Effingham County Planning Board review (hereafter planning board), and public hearings. All data set forth in appendix C, shall be submitted to the planning board, and subsequently forwarded to the Effingham County Board of Commissioners (hereafter board of commissioners) with the recommendations of the planning board. If approved by the board of commissioners, the master plan shall be officially delineated on the zoning districts map and such plan and all information submitted in conjunction with the proposal, as amended, shall be adopted as planned development district. All further development shall conform to the standards adopted for the district, regardless of any changes in ownership. The violation of any provision of the master plan, as submitted and approved, shall constitute a violation of this Ordinance. In any event, where it is determined by the board of commissioners that development of the PD district is not in accordance with the standards adopted for that district, the board of commissioners shall be empowered to amend the Ordinance to place parts or all of the property in its prior zoning classification. 
                  5.15.2.2 Any substantial changes in the development of the district shall be treated as proposed amendments to the Zoning Ordinance and must be considered in accordance with the procedures set forth in Article IX. For purposes of this subsection, substantial change shall be defined as an overall change in land use, change in acreage, or a change in project intent. Minor changes will not be treated as a proposed amendment to the Zoning Ordinance and may be approved with authorization of the county administrator and/or the county zoning administrator. Minor changes for the purpose of this subsection shall be defined as changes in street access or alignment, changes in public or common areas, changes in building setbacks or buffers. The zoning administrator shall be responsible for determining whether a proposed change is substantial or minor. Substantial changes must be approved by planning board and county commission. Appeals based on hardship or an alleged misinterpretation of the Ordinance by the zoning administrator shall be processed in accordance with the procedures set forth in Article IX of this Ordinance. 
                  5.15.2.3 Only after the PD zoning has been approved by the board of commissioners, may the applicant submit a site plan for development, however, no building permit shall be issued for a PD district until a site plan conforming to the requirements set forth in Appendix B, entitled subdivision regulations, found within the Effingham County Code, has been submitted to and approved by the Board of Commissioners. 
                  5.15.2.4 No site plan approved by the board of commissioners shall be valid for a period longer than 12 months, unless within such period a preliminary plat is submitted pursuant to Appendix B of the Effingham County Code. The planning board may recommend to the board of commissioners to grant extensions not exceeding 12 months each upon written request of the original applicant if the application submitted is substantially the same as the initial application. However, the planning board, with approval of the board of commissioners, has the power in such cases to attach new conditions to its reapproval or disapproval of the reapplication. Where the application for reapproval contains changes which the zoning administrator concludes materially alter the initial application, he shall initiate a new site plan review procedure as stated herein.

A listing of permitted uses for each separate tract within a particular PD district shall be adopted as part of the regulations applying to that district. Thereafter, the uses permitted in the district shall be restricted to those listed, approved and adopted according to procedures set forth herein. 
                  5.15.5 Preliminary Plan Approval. 
                  5.15.5.1 In all PD zoned districts, a building permit shall not be issued by the building official until the preliminary plan (as defined within Appendix B of the Effingham County Code) has been approved by the planning board and board of commissioners in accordance with Chapter 30, Article III (Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control), Chapter 34 (Flood Damage Prevention), Chapter 58, Article I (Roads), and Appendix B (Subdivision Regulations) of the Effingham County Code.

                  5.15.5.3 An application for preliminary plan approval may be filed by any person having a financial, contractual or proprietary interest in the property. Said application shall be filed with the zoning administrator at least 26 days prior to the date at which it is to be considered and shall include six copies of a site plan prepared by a registered surveyor, architect, landscape architect, or engineer at a scale of not less than 1 inch = 400 feet, as well one copy on 11- by 17-inch sheet. The sketch plan shall conform to the requirements set forth in Appendix B. 
                  5.15.5.4 Within 26 days after the filing of an application for preliminary plan approval the planning board, after giving public notice, shall hold a hearing to act on the application. If the planning board fails to act within 90 days after formal submission, the preliminary plan shall be deemed to have been approved as submitted, unless the applicant consents to an extension. The planning board, at said hearing, shall pass their order of approval or approval with conditions. 
                  The planning board, before acting upon the preliminary plan shall ensure that it complies with the provisions of this Ordinance, the design criteria and development standards set forth in Appendix B, and any applicable special requirements set forth within the Effingham County Code. 
                  5.15.5.5 Conditions and restrictions. 
                  a)  In approving a sketch plan application, the planning board may recommend and the board of commissioners may impose conditions and restrictions and may vary the standards set forth in this Ordinance so long as the general intent of this Ordinance is carried out and the zoning district regulations established herein are not varied as to make them less restrictive. If the planning board and board of commissioners so acts, it shall specifically state those requirements which must be met before an applicant may be granted sketch plan approval, preliminary plan approval and a building permit. 
                  b)  In the event the planning board requires any correction or revision of the preliminary plan, the applicant shall submit a preliminary plan corrected or revised in accordance with the recommendation of the planning board and decisions of the board of commissioners before, preliminary plan approval and a building permit may be granted. 
                  c)  The planning board may recommend and the board of commissioners may delegate to the zoning administrator the power to grant the final approval of the preliminary plan application upon the administrator's determination that the specifically prescribed conditions and/or corrections have been met by the applicant. 
                  5.15.5.6 Following preliminary plan approval, the use of land and the construction or alteration of any buildings and structure shall be governed by the approved master plan and approved preliminary plan, except that, minor changes in the location or character of buildings and structures may be authorized by the zoning administrator. No change so authorized may increase the size of any building or structure by more than ten percent, nor change the location of any building or structure by more than ten feet in any direction; provided however, the zoning administrator may not permit changes beyond conditions of approval or requirements set forth in this Ordinance. 
                  5.15.5.7 If the proposed master plan includes the subdivision of land for any purpose or the installation of new streets, the information required above any additional information required for the submittal of preliminary plan and subdivision plats under Appendix B of Effingham County shall be processed in accordance with Appendix B. 
                  5.15.6 Design Criteria and Development Standards. 
                  5.15.6.1 In all PD districts, the general provisions set forth in Appendix B shall govern unless relief is granted by the planning board and the board of commissioners. 
                  5.15.6.2 The planning board and the board of commissioners, before approving a PD district master plan, and preliminary plan, shall ensure that the respective plans comply with the following applicable design criteria and development standards: 
                  a)  Overall site design should be harmonious in terms of landscaping, enclosure of principal and accessory uses, parcel sizes, street patterns, and land use relationships. Variety in building types, heights, facades, setbacks, and size of open spaces shall be encouraged. Common open space shall be at least 20 percent of the overall site. In a PD-R or residential portion of a PD-MU no more than 50 percent of required common open space shall be unbuildable land. 
                  b)  Unless otherwise specified in the approved development text, densities per acre for residential dwelling units shall not exceed those set forth for residential districts. 
                  c)  Yard and other dimensional requirements for each PD district may be set by the board of commissioners, upon recommendation of the planning board. Residential district standards shall serve as minimum requirements for residential units proposed for location in a PD district. The most restrictive standards specified elsewhere in this Ordinance as they apply to commercial, industrial, and institutional uses shall serve as minimum requirements for such uses located in PD districts. 
                  d)  Parking, loading and other requirements for each PD district may be set by the board of commissioners, upon recommendation of the planning board. The standards of Appendix B shall serve as a general guide to such requirements, except that, the number of off-street parking spaces may be modified in consideration of the following factors: Probable number of cars owned by dwelling unit occupants; and varying time periods of use, when use of common parking areas is proposed. 
                  e)  Where development abuts a separate single-family residential district, buildings, parking lots and other structures other than single-family dwellings and two-family dwellings, must be set back from the separating property line or district boundary line, not less than 30 feet for multi-family residential, public or institutional uses or 50 feet for commercial or industrial uses, to ensure the absence of any objectionable effects on or from abutting districts. 
                  Property lines abutting single-family residential districts must be screened by a permanent, attractive planted buffer, wall or fence not less than six feet in height and sufficient to screen out excessive sound and view from the residential areas, except in the following instances: 
                  Where one and two-family dwellings within the PD district are on property immediately adjoining a residential district, then the planning board may recommend and the board of commissioners may waive the buffer requirement. 
                  Where multi-family dwellings and townhouses within the PD district are on property immediately adjoining multi-family dwellings or townhouses in a residential district, then the planning board may recommend and the board of commissioners may waive the buffer requirement. 
                  However, all parking lots, storage yards, and outdoor recreation areas must be enclosed with a planting screen, wall or fence to a height of at least six feet excluding gates or exit points. 
                  f)  Within a PD district, the design should include buffers suitable for screening residential areas from institutional, commercial and industrial uses when a danger of incompatibility appears to exist. 
                  g)  Lighting facilities shall be arranged in a manner which will protect the highway and neighboring properties from direct glare or hazardous interference of any kind. 
                  h)  Sign requirements may be set by the board of commissioners, following recommendation by the planning board. 
                  i)  In PD districts, areas used for parking and loading or for traffic ways shall be physically separated from public streets by suitable barriers against unchanneled motor vehicles ingress or egress. Access ways shall generally conform to standards set forth in Appendix B, with the following conditions: 
                  Shopping centers, other individual commercial, industrial, institutional and multi-family uses shall have not more than two access points to any one public street, unless unusual circumstances demonstrate the need for additional access points. 
                  Where possible, all access points to a public street from shopping centers or other individual commercial, industrial, institutional and multi-family uses shall be located at least 100 feet from the intersection of any street right-of-way and shall be designed in a manner conducive to safe ingress and egress. 
                  [5.15.7] Permitted PD Districts. 
                  The following uses shall be classified as planned developments subject to the provisions of this section governing such projects, and to the special provisions as indicated: 
                  5.15.7.1 Cultural or civic center (PD-C) 
                  Characteristics and intent: It is the intent of the PD-C district to permit in the form of a large scale development the location and proper arrangement of major public and/or private cultural and civic facilities as well as any necessary supporting activities. 
                  5.15.7.2 Mixed use (PD-MU). 
                  Characteristics and Intent: It is the intent of the PD-MU district to encourage the large scale planned development of mixed uses or groups of uses not otherwise provided for in this section but considered by the planning board and the board of commissioners to be compatible and worthy for inclusion in a PD district, and further, to encourage the development of such uses or groups of uses according to the requirements and standards of this section. 
                  5.15.7.3 Industrial (PD-I). 
                  Characteristics and intent: It is the intent of the PD-I to be developed and reserved primarily for industrial purposes in a planned, organized and controlled development. The regulations which apply within this district are designed to encourage the formation and continuance of compatible industrial uses which involve manufacturing, assembling and processing operations or the sale and distribution of goods or products at wholesale and to discourage any encroachment by residential, commercial or other uses, except those which augment the principal purpose of the district. 
                  Special requirements: In addition to the information required in Appendix B, site plans for PD-I districts shall show the following items, if applicable: 
                  a)  Loading zones. 
                  b)  Rail facilities.

                  Characteristics and intent: In view of the unique methods of hospitals, their land needs, and their effect on surrounding properties, it is intended that this planned development be set aside as a specialized area for hospitals and allied services; that this area be protected against encroachment from non-related and incompatible uses, that provisions be made for the expansion of hospitals and allied services, and that, to the greatest possible extent, surrounding land uses and properties be stabilized against any possible detrimental effects that might be created by the proximity of the hospital and allied services. 
                  5.15.7.5 Residential (PD-R). 
                  Characteristics and intent: It is the intent of this Ordinance that the PD-R district may be applied to any residential area where the developer wishes to apply use regulations or controls more restrictive than those required by other residential districts in this Ordinance. 
                  Special requirements: In addition to other information required elsewhere in this section for submission of a PD district, applications for PD-R districts shall be accompanied by any additional restrictions, limitations, conditions, plans, easements, rights, or privileges beyond those normally required in a residential district in this Ordinance, which the developer proposes for application to this proposed PD district. 
                  Such information shall be submitted in written form or, where applicable, on maps. The information shall be reviewed in the normal course of processing the PD proposal. If the over-all PD district proposal is adopted as a part of the Ordinance, those restrictions or other conditions approved by the planning board and the board of commissioners shall also be adopted as part of the requirements applying to that particular PD district and shall also become part of the Ordinance. 
                  5.15.7.6 Shopping center (PD-S). 
                  Characteristics and intent: The purpose of the PD-S district shall be to encourage the logical and timely development of land for commercial purposes and the expansion of shopping and/or commercial centers, in accordance with the objectives, policies and standards of the comprehensive plan; and to discourage any use which would interfere with the use of the district as a shopping, commercial and service center for surrounding residential neighborhoods. 
                  In addition to information required elsewhere in this section, applicants for PD-S districts may be required to submit a market analysis showing the economic need for a shopping center of the size being proposed, and the inadequacy of existing commercial districts and vacant, commercially zoned land to meet this need. For these purposes, the market analysis shall contain the following: 
                  a)  Determination of the population of the trade area of the proposed shopping center; 
                  b)  Determination of average family incomes by logical sub-areas, and the effective buying power, both at present and ten years in the future; 
                  c)  Estimates of the square footage and gross sales of competitive retail stores; and 
                  d)  Determination of net potential customer buying power for stores in the proposed shopping center. 
                  5.15.7.7 Mobile Home Park (PD-MH). 
                  Characteristics and intent: It is the intent of the PD-MH district to provide a sound and healthy residential environment unique to this housing style. Minimum lot and site requirements shall meet or exceed those detailed in Appendix C. Design criteria and development standards in the PD district regulations shall also apply, Section 5.15. Rules and regulations for development of mobile home parks shall be presented to applicants for inclusion in their planned development zoning text. 
                  5.15.8 Maintaining Common Facilities/Areas. 
                  If other satisfactory arrangements have not been met prior to approval, i.e., public dedication or private owner management, a homeowners or property owners association shall be created for operating, maintaining, and improving common facilities such as streets, driveways, parking areas, drainage ways, landscaping and recreation areas.

                  ARTICLE VII. - PLANNING BOARD 

                  7.1 - Organization. 
                  The planning board shall consist of five members, one member each from the respective commissioner election districts of the county. 
                  At their first regular meeting in February 2002, the board of commissioners shall appoint one member from each of the five respective election districts of the county board of commissioners to serve commencing with the February 2002 regular meeting of the planning board. The members representing the second, third, and fifth districts shall serve through the January 2003 regular meeting of the planning board. The members representing the first and fourth election districts shall serve through the January 2005 regular meeting of the planning board. Thereafter, successors shall be appointed every four years at the first regular meeting of the board of commissioners in February immediately following the general election of the commissioner representing said district. The term of each respective planning board member representing a commissioner election district shall commence upon appointment and extend through the January regular meeting of the planning board immediately following the next general election of the commissioner representing said district. 
                  Any vacancy in the membership shall be filled for the unexpired term in the same manner as the initial appointment. Members shall be removable for cause by the board of commissioners upon written charges and after a public hearing. The board of commissioners shall determine the amount of compensation, if any, to be paid to members of the planning board. 
                  7.1.1 Procedure. The planning board shall elect one of its members as chairman, who shall serve for one year or until he is reelected or his successor is elected. The planning board will also elect a vice chairman who will conduct meetings in the absence of the chairman. The zoning administrator shall appoint a secretary. The planning board shall adopt rules in accordance with the provisions of any ordinance or resolution adopted pursuant to this ordinance. 
                  7.1.2 Meetings. Meetings of the planning board shall be held on the fourth Monday of each month. The chairman, or in his absence, the vice-chairman, may administer oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses by subpoena. The planning board shall keep minutes of its proceedings, show the vote of each member upon each question, or if absent or failing to vote, indicate such fact, and shall keep records of its examinations and other official actions, all of which shall be immediately filed in the office of the board and shall be a public record. 
                  7.1.3 Filing. The planning board shall require the applicant to furnish such information as it deems necessary when filing an application and may require specific forms to be used. 
                  7.1.4 Review authority. It shall be the responsibility of the planning board to review and recommend to county commission approval, disapproval, or approval with conditions on all requests for rezoning, map and text interpretations, and other amendments submitted to the building and zoning administrator or initiated by any other individual or governmental unit. The issuance of conditional use permits and variances shall be the responsibility of the county commission after review and recommendation of the planning board. 
                  7.1.5 Map amendments. It shall be the responsibility of the zoning administrator to maintain, revise, and update the official zoning map. 
                  7.1.6 Conditional uses. It shall be the responsibility of the planning board to review and recommend to county commission on all requests for interpretation of conditional use. The initial application for a conditional use shall be made to the zoning administrator who shall determine whether the use is allowed as a conditional use in the particular zone. If such use is allowed, then the zoning administrator shall submit the application to the planning board. After review by the planning board, recommendations shall be presented to the county commission as to additional restraints, restrictions, qualifications, or limiting factors that are felt to be desirable. The county commission shall review all recommendations and approve or disapprove the conditional use upon review by the planning board. 
                  Considerations for determining additional requirements for conditional use. 
                  (a)  Approval of a conditional use shall not adversely affect the economic values or the physical appearance of the neighborhood or areas surrounding the site or lot in question. 
                  (b)  The physical and environmental effects of allowing the conditional use shall be considered. 
                  (c)  Buffer zones, where necessary to shield any adverse factors, shall be considered. 
                  (d)  Additional space for parking, landscaping, building, loading zones, and setback shall be considered if necessary to protect adjacent structures or lots from any adverse impact. 
                  7.1.7 Interpretations of the zoning map. Where the street or lot layout actually on the ground, or as recorded, differs from the street and lot lines as shown on the zoning map, the planning board, after notice to the owners of the property and after public hearing, shall interpret the map in such a way as to carry out the intent and purpose of this ordinance. In case of any question as to the location of any boundary line between zoning districts, a request for interpretation of the zoning map may be made of the planning board and an official determination shall be made by the county commission. 
                  7.1.8 Variances. On an appeal from an order, requirement, decision, or determination of the zoning administrator, the planning board may recommend that the county commission grant a variance in the application of the provisions of the zoning ordinance, only if all the following findings are made: 
                  7.1.8.1 That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions, including irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness, of lot size or shape, or exceptional topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the particular property, and that the unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions, and not to circumstances or conditions generally created by the provisions of the zoning ordinance in the neighborhood or district in which the property is located. 
                  7.1.8.2 That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is no possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with the provisions of the zoning ordinance, and that the authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property. 
                  7.1.9 Specific limitations of powers of the planning board. The planning board does not have the power to amend any zoning ordinance, to rezone any land, to declare this zoning ordinance or any amendment thereto invalid, or to allow any use not permitted by this zoning ordinance. 
                  The fact that a property owner will suffer financial hardship if not granted a special exception or a variance from the zoning ordinance is of itself insufficient ground for granting a variance. 
                  (Amend. of 4-4-00(21); Amend. of 1-3-02; Amend. of 3-3-15) 
                  7.2 - Administration. 
                  The county commission may uphold, reverse, add, delete, or modify with conditions any recommendation made by the planning board.

                  8.2.1.1.4 Driveways and access roads. Where any driveway or access road is to cross any drainage ditch or adjoin any public street, the party proposing to construct such driveway or access road shall submit a plan to the public works director, accompanied by a fee in the amount established by the board of commissioners. Said plan shall show the grade, location, and design of all improvements, including the concrete culvert at the site of each such crossing.

                  An application for a certificate of occupancy shall be granted or refused within 15 days after the zoning administrator has been officially notified of (a) completion of construction, or (b) application to occupy and use land where no construction is involved.

                  ARTICLE IX. - AMENDMENTS TO MAP OR TEXT 

                  9.1 - General. 
                  Whenever, in the opinion of the Effingham County Commission, the public necessity, convenience, general welfare, or good zoning practice require, the county commission by ordinance, may, after receipt of recommendation thereon from the planning board and subject to the procedures provided by law, amend, supplement, or change the regulations, text, district boundaries, or classifications of property now or hereafter established by this ordinance or amendments thereof. 
                  9.2 - Procedure for change in zoning district. 
                  9.2.1 Applications. Applications for any change in the text or classifications or property shown on the zoning map shall be submitted to the zoning administrator upon such forms and accompanied by such data and information as may be prescribed for that purpose by him, so as to assure the fullest practicable presentation of facts for the record. Each application for a change of district boundaries or classification or property shall be verified by at least one of the owners or lessees of property within the area proposed to be reclassified, attesting to the truth and correctness of all facts and information presented with the application. It shall contain a map of the area proposed to be rezoned, and the area within 200 feet, giving the names and addresses of property owners, and all district boundary lines, and streets and alleys located therein. The zoning administrator shall check the application to determine whether it conforms with the requirements listed above and, if satisfactory, shall submit it to the office of the planning board. Amendments to the zoning ordinance may also be initiated by the planning board by resolution, and recommended to the county commissioners for adoption. 
                  9.2.2 Required public hearings. No official action shall be taken on any proposed zoning amendment unless at least two public hearings have been held. The first public hearing shall be conducted by the planning board and the second shall be conducted by the county commission.

                  The zoning administrator shall then notify the applicant of the date, time, and place of the required public hearing. 
                  At least 16 but not more than 44 days prior to scheduled public hearings the building and zoning inspector shall publish in the newspaper of general circulation notice of the date, time, place, and purpose of the public hearing. 
                  If a zoning amendment is for the rezoning of property, then the public notice shall also include: (1) the location of the property; (2) the present zoning classification of the property; and (3) the proposed zoning of the property.

                  No official action shall be taken on a proposed amendment by the county commission until after the required public hearings have been conducted. 
                  The primary goal of conducting public hearings on proposed zoning amendments shall be to solicit pertinent factual information which will be beneficial in helping the planning board and the county commissioners judge the merits of each specific proposed amendment. 
                  9.3.1 Notice to property owners. The planning board shall give notice of the date, time, place, and purpose of public hearings to be held by it on proposed amendments or supplements by mail to the owners of all properties lying within 200 feet of any part of the property proposed to be changed.

                  9.3.2 Action on planning board. The planning board may recommend that the application be granted as requested, or it may recommend a modification of the zoning amendment requested in the application, or it may recommend that the application not be granted. These recommendations shall then be certified to the county commissioners. 
                  9.3.3 Public hearing by commissioners. After receiving from the planning board the certification of said recommendations on the proposed amendment, and before adoption of such amendment, the commissioners shall hold a public hearing thereon, following the procedures set forth herein for calling and conducting public hearings. 
                  9.3.4 Action of the county commissioners. The county commissioners shall consider the recommendations of the planning board, and vote on the proposed amendment to the text or map of the zoning ordinance after the public hearing. The applicant and others so requesting shall receive notice of the decision of the county commissioners through the zoning administrator. 
                  9.3.5 Denial of rezonings. If the decision of the county commission is to deny the rezoning of property, then the same property may not again be considered for rezoning until the expiration of at least six months immediately following the defeat of the rezoning by the county commission. 
                  9.4 - Procedure for conducting a public hearing. 
                  All public hearings on zoning amendments shall be chaired by either the chairman of the planning board or the county commission chairman or their designees. 
                  A secretary shall record the proceedings of the public hearing. Verbatim transcripts of the public hearing can be provided if requested and paid for in advance by the requesting party. 
                  The record of the public hearing and all evidence submitted at the public hearing shall be recorded as such and become a permanent part of the particular zoning amendment's file. 
                  The chairman of the planning board or county commission chairman shall preside at the public hearing and shall identify speakers, maintain order, and conduct the public hearing. 
                  The process to be followed in conducting these hearings shall be as follows: 
                  The presiding officer shall open the hearing by stating the specific zoning amendment being considered at the public hearing. 
                  Where there are a large number of individuals wishing to testify at a hearing, the presiding officer may invoke time limits on individual speakers. In such cases, these time limits shall apply to all speakers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, in no event shall the aggregate time afforded to those in favor or those opposed to a zoning amendment be less than ten minutes. 
                  The presiding officer shall recognize the individual parties wishing to testify or present evidence and allow them to present this information. 
                  Once all parties have concluded their testimony, the presiding officer shall adjourn the public hearing. 
                  9.5 - Effingham County rezoning checklist. 
                  Applicants requesting a zoning change shall supply to the planning board information describing the proposed change plus supporting data relating to the change to assist the planning board in making their determination. The supporting documentation shall include a format substantially the same as the checklist/criteria used by the planning board in evaluating the requested zoning change. 
                  After receiving all information presented as to each zoning proposal at any public hearing provided for in this article, and prior to making any recommendation thereon, the planning board shall consider each of the eight questions contained in the following checklist in written form and forward a copy of the same to the board of commissioners together with any additional material deemed appropriate: 
                  CHECKLIST: 
                  The Effingham County Planning Board recommends:

The planning board shall further consider the possible negative effect of the structure on the property values of other properties in the immediate area and the possible effect the structure could have on the surrounding area in the event of inclement weather or high winds. 
                  3.4 Appeals. 
                  3.4.1 The county commission may approve an exemption from one or more of the compatibility standards provided herein on the basis of finding that the material to be utilized or the architectural style proposed for the structure will be compatible and harmonious with existing structures in the vicinity. The findings must be in writing and adopted by the county commission. 
                  3.4.2 The applicant must apply for the exemption and carry the burden of proof to establish that the structure is compatible with surrounding structures.

                  1.1.7 It shall be a violation of this ordinance to occupy or commence activity from any structure without first obtaining a certificate of occupancy from the zoning administrator or his designee, who shall determine, before issuing a certificate of occupancy, that the structure is in compliance with the terms of this ordinance and all other zoning requirements and county ordinances. In the event the zoning administrator or his designee is unable to determine whether the applicant meets the criteria established by this ordinance, the zoning administrator may refer the matter to the planning board for a final determination of applicability. 
                  1.2 Manufactured homes or industrialized buildings may be permitted in nonresidential districts for nonresidential uses provided the following criteria are met: 
                  1.2.1 Placement of said structure complies with the requirements and limitations generally applicable in such zoning districts, including but not limited to minimum lot size, yard and building spacing, square footage requirements, percentage of lot coverage, off-street parking requirements, and approved foundations as described herein;

                  Sec. 1. - Legislative findings. 
                  The County Commissioners of Effingham County, Georgia finds that: 
                  1.1  Based on the Effingham County Comprehensive Plan adopted by the county pursuant to O.C.G.A., title 36, chapter 70, including but not limited to the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan, and the general governmental goal of protecting the health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the county, it is necessary that the county's public facilities for (1) park and recreation facilities, (2) arterial roads and intersections, (3) public safety, (4) water, and (5) sewer be expanded and improved to accommodate new development within the county. Throughout this ordinance, the system improvements for these six types of public facilities are sometimes collectively referred to as the "County Capital Facilities" and sometimes individually referred to as "County Capital Facility Elements." 
                  1.2  New residential and nonresidential development imposes and will impose increasing and excessive demands upon county capital facilities. 
                  1.3  The revenues generated from new residential and non-residential development often does not generate sufficient funds to provide the necessary improvements of these county capital facilities to accommodate new development. 
                  1.4  New development is expected to continue, and will place ever-increasing demands on the county to provide and expand county capital facilities to serve new development. 
                  1.5  The county has planned for the improvement of the county capital facilities in the capital improvements element of the Effingham County Comprehensive Plan. 
                  1.6  O.C.G.A., title 36, chapter 71, (the Georgia Development Impact Fee Act) authorizes the county to adopt a development impact fee ordinance to offset, recoup, or reimburse the portion of the costs of needed improvements to the county capital facilities caused by new development in the county. 
                  1.7  The creation of an equitable development impact fee system would enable the county to impose a proportionate share of the costs of needed improvements to county capital facilities to accommodate new development, and would assist the county to implement the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan. 
                  1.8  In order to implement an equitable development impact fee system for the county capital facilities, the county retained Tischler and Associates to prepare an impact fee study for these types of facilities. The resulting document is titled "Effingham County, Georgia, Impact Fees and Capital Improvements Element", dated November 1, 2004 (the " Development Impact Fee Study "), and is on file in the office of the clerk of the board of county commissioners. 
                  1.9  The Development Impact Fee Study is consistent with the Capital Improvements Element of the Effingham County Comprehensive Plan, and uses the levels of service (LOS) set forth in the comprehensive plan for these county capital facilities. 
                  1.10  The Development Impact Fee Study sets forth reasonable methodologies and analyses for determining the impacts of various types of new development on the county capital facilities, and determines the cost of acquiring or constructing the improvements necessary to meet the demands for such facilities created by new development. 
                  1.11  In accordance with the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, the Development Impact Fee Study was based on actual system improvement costs or reasonable estimates of such costs. In addition, the Development Impact Fee Study uses a fee calculation methodology that is net of credits for the present value of revenues that will be generated by new growth and development based on historical funding patterns and that are anticipated to be available to pay for system improvements, including taxes, assessments, user fees, and intergovernmental transfers. 
                  1.12  The development impact fees described in this ordinance are based on the Development Impact Fee Study, and do not exceed the costs of system improvements for county capital facilities to serve new development that will pay the development impact fees. 
                  1.13  The park and recreation facilities, arterial roads and intersections, and public safety facilities included in the calculation of fees in the Development Impact Fee Study will benefit all new residential development throughout the county, and it is therefore appropriate to treat all unincorporated areas of the county as a single service area for purposes of calculating, collecting, and spending the development impact fees collected from residential development for those four development impact fee elements. 
                  1.14  The arterial roads and intersections, and the public safety facilities included in the calculation of fees in the Development Impact Fee Study will benefit all new non-residential development throughout the county, and it is therefore appropriate to treat all unincorporated areas of the county as a single service area for purposes of calculating, collecting, and spending the development impact fees collected from non-residential development for those two development impact fee elements. 
                  1.15  Specific sewer facilities included in the calculation of fees in the Development Impact Fee Study will benefit those areas of the county that receive sewer services from those facilities, and it is therefore appropriate to define a single service area for purposes of collecting and spending of sewer impact fees. 
                  1.16  Specific water facilities included in the calculation of fees in the Development Impact Fee Study will benefit those areas of the county that receive water services from those facilities, and it is therefore appropriate to define a single service area for purposes of collecting and spending of water impact fees. 
                  1.17  There is both a rational nexus and a rough proportionality between the development impacts created by each type of development covered by this ordinance and the development impact fees that such development will be required to pay. 
                  1.18  This ordinance creates a system by which development impact fees paid by new development will be used to finance, defray, or reimburse a portion of the costs incurred by the county to construct improvements for county capital facilities in ways that benefit the development that paid each fee within a reasonable period of time after the fee is paid. 
                  1.19  This ordinance creates a system under which development impact fees shall not be used to correct existing deficiencies for these capital facilities, or to replace or rehabilitate existing improvements, or to pay for routine operation or maintenance of those facilities. 
                  1.20  This ordinance is consistent with all applicable provisions of O.C.G.A., title 36, chapter 71, concerning development impact fee ordinances. 
                  Sec. 2. - Authority and applicability. 
                  2.1  This ordinance is enacted pursuant to the county's general police power, the authority granted to the county pursuant to O.C.G.A., title 36, chapter 71, and other applicable laws of the State of Georgia. 
                  2.2  This ordinance shall apply to the unincorporated area of the county, and to any incorporated areas of the county where the municipal government has executed an intergovernmental agreement with the county for purposes of collection or expenditure of development impact fees pursuant to O.C.G.A., § 36-71-11, and other applicable laws of the State of Georgia. 
                  Sec. 3. - Intent.

Such written request shall be filed prior to the time the feepayor applies for the first building permit that creates an obligation to pay the type of impact fee against which the credit is requested, or the claim for the credit shall be waived. 
                  .2  After receipt of the request for credit, the board of commissioners or a designee shall review the request and determine whether the land or improvements offered for credit will reduce the costs of providing county capital facilities by an amount at least equal to the value of the credit. If the board of commissioners or a designee determines that the offered credit satisfies these criteria, then the credit shall be issued. 
                  9.6  T ransferability of credit. A credit may only be transferred by the developer that has received the credit to a successor in interest pursuant to the terms of this ordinance. The credit may be used only to offset development impact fees for the same county capital facility element for which the credit was issued, and within the same service area for which the credit was issued. Credits shall be transferred by any written instrument clearly identifying which credits issued under this Ordinance are being transferred, the dollar amount of the credit being transferred, and the county capital facilities element and service area for which the credit was issued. The instrument of transfer shall be signed by both the transferor and transferee, and a copy of the document shall be delivered to the county administrator or a designee for documentation of the change in ownership before it shall become effective. 
                  9.7  Accounting of credits. Each time a request to use approved credits is presented to the county, the county shall reduce the amount of the development impact fees for the type of fee for which the credit is provided, and shall note in the county's records the amount of credit remaining, if any. Upon request of the feepayor or successor in interest to whom the credit was issued, the county shall issue a letter stating the amount of credit remaining. 
                  9.8  Credits exceeding fee amounts. 
                  .1  If a developer enters into an agreement with the county to dedicate, construct, fund, or contribute system improvements that qualify for credits pursuant to this section 9, and the amount of the credit created by such dedication, construction, funding, or contribution exceeds the development impact fees that would otherwise have been paid for that county capital facilities element, the developer shall be reimbursed for such excess construction, funding, or contribution from development impact fees paid for such development impact fee element by other development located in the service area that is benefited by such improvements. 
                  .2  To assist in such reimbursement, the county shall continue to collect development impact fees from other developers whose proposed development will benefit from the dedication, construction, funding, or contribution, and will promptly transfer such funds to the developer to whom the credit was given, or to a successor in interest. If a successor in interest claims a reimbursement for the excess credit, the board of commissioners or a designee may require written documentation that such rights have been conveyed to the claimant prior to issuing the requested reimbursement. 
                  .3  Credits issued for one county capital facilities element may not be used to reduce development impact fees due for a different capital facilities element, or to reduce development fees in a different service area. 
                  .4  Unless otherwise stated in an agreement with the developer, the county shall be under no obligation to use any county funds - other than development impact fees paid by other development for the same county capital facility element in the same service area - to reimburse the developer for any amount by which such developer's dedication, construction, funding, or contribution exceeds development impact fees otherwise due from such developer for any capital facilities element. 
                  Sec. 10. - Appeals and arbitration. 
                  Disputes regarding decisions made in the application of this ordinance shall be resolved through appeal to the county commissioners, or through binding arbitration, as set forth below. 
                  10.1  Right to appeal. 
                  .1  Any developer or successor in interest who is or may be obligated to pay a development impact fee, or who claims a right to receive a refund, reimbursement, or credit under this ordinance, may appeal a decision made by the board of commissioners designee in applying this ordinance, may appeal such decision to the county commissioners. 
                  .2  In order to pursue such an appeal, the developer or successor in interest shall file a written notice of the appeal with the board of commissioners or a designee within 30 days after the date of the decision being appealed, or the date on which the developer or successor in interest submitted a payment of development impact fees under protest, whichever is later. Such written application shall include a statement describing why the applicant believes that the decision was in error, together with copies of any documents that the applicant believes support the claim. 
                  .3  The county commissioners shall hear the appeal within 60 days after receipt of a written notice of appeal. The appellant shall have a right to be present and to present evidence in support of the appeal. The board of commissioners or designee who made the decision under appeal shall likewise have the right to be present and to present evidence in support of the decision. The criteria to be used by the county commissioners shall be whether (a) the decision or interpretation made by the board of commissioners or a designee, or (b) the alternative decision or interpretation offered by the appellant, more accurately reflects the intents of this ordinance that new development in the county pay its proportionate share of the costs of system improvements to county capital facilities necessary to serve new development. The county commissioners shall issue a decision upholding, reversing, or modifying the decision being appealed within 30 days after hearing the appeal. 
                  10.2  Binding arbitration. 
                  .1  As an alternative to the appeal process set forth in subsection 10.1 above, any developer or successor in interest who is or may be obligated to pay a development impact fee, or who claims a right to receive a refund, reimbursement, or credit under this ordinance, and who is dissatisfied with a decision made by the county administrator or a designee in applying this ordinance, may request that the dispute be resolved through binding arbitration. Such arbitration shall be at the feepayor's expense. 
                  .2  In order to pursue such an appeal, the developer or successor in interest shall file a written request for binding arbitration with the board of commissioners or a designee within 30 days after the date of the decision being appealed, or the date on which the developer or successor in interest submitted a payment of development impact fees under protest, whichever is later. Such written application shall include a statement of why the applicant believes that the decision was in error, together with copies of any documents that the applicant believes support the claim. 
                  .3  The county shall then make arrangements for binding arbitration of the dispute pursuant to the rules of the American Arbitration Association for disputes of this type, except that the allocation of the costs of arbitration shall not be subject to such rules, and shall instead be paid by the developer or successor in interest requesting the arbitration. 
                  Sec. 11. - Miscellaneous provisions. 
                  11.1  Notwithstanding any other provision of this ordinance, that portion of a project for which a valid building permit has been issued prior to the effective date of this ordinance shall not be subject to the development impact fees imposed by this ordinance so long as the building permit remains valid and construction is commenced and is pursued according to the terms of the permit. 
                  11.2  Nothing in this ordinance shall restrict the county from requiring developer or an applicant for a development approval or building permit to construct project improvements or other reasonable project improvements required to serve the applicant's project, whether or not such improvements are of a type for which credits are available under section 9 of this ordinance, provided that such request does not duplicate a system improvement for which costs were included in the Development Impact Fee Study. 
                  11.3  At least once during each fiscal year of the county, county administrator or a designee shall present to the county commission a proposed capital improvements program, and such capital improvements program shall assign monies from each development impact fee trust fund account to specific projects and related expenses for the type of system improvements for which the fees in that account were paid. Any monies, including any accrued interest not assigned to specific system improvements within such capital improvements program and not expended pursuant to section 7 of this ordinance or refunded pursuant to section 8 of this ordinance shall be retained in the same account until the next fiscal year. 
                  11.4  The county shall be entitled to retain not more than three percent of the development impact fees collected as payment for the expenses of collecting the fees and administering this ordinance. 
                  11.5  If development impact fees are calculated and paid based on a mistake or misrepresentation, they shall be recalculated within 90 days of the issue being raised. Any amounts overpaid by a feepayor shall be refunded by the county within 30 days after the county's acceptance of the recalculated amount, with interest at the rate of three percent per annum since the date of such overpayment. Any amounts underpaid by the feepayor shall be paid to the county within 30 days after the county's acceptance of the recalculated amount, with interest at the rate of three percent percent per annum since the date of such underpayment. In the case of an underpayment to the county, the county shall not issue any additional development approvals or building permits for the project for which the development impact fee was paid until such underpayment is corrected, and if amounts owed to the county are not paid within such 30-day period, the county may also repeal any development approvals or building permits issued in reliance on the previous payment of such development impact fee and refund such fee to feepayor who made the payment. 
                  11.6  The development impact fees described in this ordinance and the administrative procedures of this ordinance shall be reviewed at least once every five years to ensure that (1) the demand and cost assumptions underlying such fees are still valid, (2) the resulting fees do not exceed the actual cost of constructing the county capital facilities the monies collected or to be collected in each account have been and are expected to be spent for system improvements of the type for which such fees were paid, and (4) such system improvements will benefit those developments for which the fees were paid. 
                  11.7  Nothing in this ordinance shall be construed to prevent or prohibit private agreements between property owners or developers and the county in regard to the construction or installation of system improvements and providing for credits or reimbursements for system improvement costs incurred by a developer, including interproject transfers of credits or providing for reimbursement for project improvement costs that are used or shared by more than one development project. 
                  11.8  The county may exempt all or part of particular development projects from development fees if: 
                  .1  Such projects are determined to create extraordinary economic development and employment growth or affordable housing; 
                  .2  The public policy which supports the exemption is contained in the county's comprehensive plan; 
                  .3  The exempt development's proportionate share of the system improvement is funded through a revenue source other than development impact fees. 
                  11.9  Violation of this ordinance shall be a misdemeanor and shall be subject to those remedies provided in Effingham County Code section 1-19. Knowingly furnishing false information to any official of the county charged with the administration of this ordinance on any matter relating to the administration of this ordinance, including without limitation the furnishing of false information regarding the expected size, use, or impacts from a proposed development, shall be a violation of this ordinance. 
                  11.10  The section titles used in this ordinance are for convenience only, and shall not affect the interpretation of any portion of the text of this ordinance. 
                  11.11  All provisions, terms, phrases and expressions contained in this ordinance shall be liberally construed in order that the true intent and meaning of the Georgia Development Impact Fee Act and the county commissioners may be fully carried out.
