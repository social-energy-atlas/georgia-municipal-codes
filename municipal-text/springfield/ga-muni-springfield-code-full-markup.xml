PREFACE 
</p>
        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE This Code constitutes a codification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Springfield, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Senior Code Attorney, and Karen Barrington, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Charles W. Barrow, City Attorney, Mr. Brett Bennett, City Manager, and Ms. Linda Rineair, City Clerk, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a code of ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

A consistent scheme of capitalization has also been used. Section catchlines have been editorially supplied. Other additions are indicated by brackets. This new Charter replaces the one adopted by Ga. Laws (Act 605), page 1296.

                  Sec. 5-14. - Prohibition of certain types of entertainment, attire and conduct. 
                  (a)  Findings, public purpose. Based on the experience of other urban counties and municipalities, which experiences are relevant to the problems faced by the city, the mayor and city council takes note of the notorious and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within our country. Moreover, it is particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages which begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. Among the acts or criminal behavior identified with nudity and alcohol are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhood, increased expenditure for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described, and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas. Therefore, the prohibition of nude conduct in establishments licensed to sell alcoholic beverages is in the public welfare and it is a matter of governmental interest, and concern to prevent the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which serve alcohol and also allow and/or encourage nudity. To that end, this section is hereby adopted. 
                  (b)  Enactment. The following types of entertainment, attire and conduct are prohibited upon any premises licensed to sell, serve or disperse alcoholic beverages. 
                  (1)  The employment or use of any person, in any capacity, in the sale or service of alcoholic beverages while such person is unclothed or in such attire, costume or clothing, as to expose to view any portion of the female breast below the top of the areola or any portion of the male or female pubic hair, anus, cleft or the buttocks, vulva and genitals. 
                  (2)  Live entertainment where any person appears in the manner described in subsection (b)(1) of this section or where such person performs acts of or acts which simulate any of the following: 
                  a.  Sexual intercourse, masturbation, sodomy, bestiality, oral copulation, flagellation or any sexual act which is prohibited by law. 
                  b.  The touching, caressing or fondling of the breasts, buttocks, anus or genitals. 
                  c.  The displaying of the male or female pubic hair, anus, vulva or genitals. 
                  (3)  The holding, promotion, sponsoring or allowance of any contest, promotion, special night, event or any other activity where patrons of the licensed establishment are encouraged or allowed to engage in any of the conduct described in subsections (b)(1) and (2) of this section.

                  e.  The 12-month period referred to in subsection (b)(3)a, b and c is inclusive of the time period of the 365 days immediately preceding the proposed sales date. 
                  (4)  Sell, offer to sell, or deliver to any person or group of persons two or more or an unlimited number of alcoholic beverages during any set period of time at a fixed price, except at private functions not open to the public. 
                  (5)  Sell, offer to sell, or deliver alcoholic beverages to any person or group of persons on any one day at prices less than those charged the general public on that day, except at private functions not open to the public.

                  (12)  Sell, offer to sell, or deliver to a customer in any container other than: 
                  a.  A glass or plastic cup for distilled spirits; 
                  b.  A standard wine glass or plastic cup, carafe or original winery bottle for any wine or fortified wine; or

                  (c)  No provision of this section shall be construed to prohibit licensees from offering free food or entertainment at any time, or to prohibit the sale or delivery of wine by bottle or carafe when sold with meals or to more than one person, or to prohibit any hotel or motel from offering room service to registered guests.

Unless flight by the person or other circumstances make it impracticable, a law enforcement officer shall, prior to any arrest for an offense under this section, afford the person an opportunity to dispel any alarm or immediate concern which would otherwise be warranted by requesting the person to identify himself and explain his presence and conduct. No person shall be convicted of an offense under this section if the law enforcement officer failed to comply with the foregoing procedure or if it appears at trial that the explanation given by the person was true and would have dispelled the alarm or immediate concern.

                  (d)  It shall be unlawful for any one or more persons to go to, to be at, to appear at, to congregate at, to assemble at, or to remain at, any place for such purposes that, under local conditions, prevailing customs, and existing circumstances in this city would cause such person in the exercise of ordinary care and discretion, as defined by the Supreme Court of this state, to believe and conclude that the being in or appearance at such place by such person, for such purposes would be in violation of, or would likely cause, a violation of the ordinances of this city, or the laws of this state, and thereby would and does cause a breach of the peace, and create public tension, and public excitement, contrary to the ordinances of this city, or the laws of this state, or contrary to the good order, peace, and dignity of this city. 
                  (e)  Should anyone violate the provisions of this section, and should any city policeman or other qualified peace officer direct or order any such person, participant, or spectator to disperse and leave any place where this section is being violated, or any adjoining area near enough to such place as to hinder or interfere with such policeman or peace officer in the line of duty, in an attempt to enforce the ordinances of this city or the laws of this state, such person on failing or refusing to leave, or disperse, shall be in violation of this Code.

                  (3)  The imposition of impact fees is one of the preferred methods of ensuring that development bears a proportionate share of the cost of sewer facilities necessary to accommodate such development and this must be done in order to promote and protect the public health, safety and welfare. 
                  (4)  Connecting to the city's sewer systems will create the need for the construction, equipping, or expansion of the water and sewer facilities. 
                  (5)  The fees established by this division are derived from, are based upon, and do not exceed the costs of providing additional sewer facilities necessitated by the connection to the city's sewer system including any state or federal mandates. 
                  (6)  The report entitled, "City of Springfield, Georgia, Sanitary Sewer Impact Fee Methodology," dated August 2007, and incorporated herein, sets forth a reasonable methodology and analysis for the determination of the impact of new development on the need for and costs for additional sewer facilities in the city. The methodology is recorded on file in the office of the city council.

In the event that the person in charge will not accept the notice, it shall be conveyed by registered mail to the responsible person. The person notified shall have 24 hours from the time of receipt of the notice, either personally delivered or received by registered mail, to correct the offending conditions. If correction is not made or a request for extension is not received by the city within 24 hours, it shall be mandatory that water and/or sewer service shall be discontinued to the offending person without further notice. If a request for an extension of time is received by the city within 24 hours of the above notice and if circumstances are such that, in the opinion of the superintendent, the best interests of the city would be served by extending the time for correction of the offending condition, then he may grant an extension of time up to a maximum limit of 30 days. 
                  (n)  Responsibilities of the person discharging waste. It shall be the responsibility of the person discharging industrial waste into the city sewage system to: 
                  (1)  Build a control structure in the discharge line from his premises, immediately prior to the entrance of the discharge line into the city sewerage system, suitable for the sampling and measuring of wastes. Plans for this structure must be approved by the city. This requirement may be waived if deemed unnecessary by the city. In the event that no special manhole is required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected. 
                  (2)  Contact the superintendent prior to operation changes which will materially alter the characteristics of the waste from the last prior sampling. 
                  (3)  Make timely, periodic payments to the city of surcharges for excessive loadings as detailed in the city user charge system. 
                  (o)  Discharge of cooling or condensing water to storm sewer systems may be allowed provided that a NPDES permit is obtained from the state EPD.

                  Sec. 104-82. - Alternative materials and methods. 
                  The provisions of the technical codes are not intended to prevent the use of any material or method of construction not specifically prescribed by them; provided, any such alternate has been reviewed by the building official. The building official shall approve any such alternate; provided, the building official finds that the alternate, for the purpose intended, is at least the equivalent of that prescribed in the technical codes, in quality, strength, effectiveness, fire resistance, durability and safety. The building official shall require that sufficient evidence or proof be submitted to substantiate any claim made regarding the alternate.

                  Drastic means the standardized system for evaluating groundwater pollution potential using the hydrogeologic settings described in U.S. Environmental Protection Agency document EPA-600/2-87-035. (Note: the drastic methodology is the most widely used technique for evaluation of pollution susceptibility.) 
                  Pollution susceptibility means the relative vulnerability of an aquifer to being polluted from spills, discharges, leaks, impoundments, applications of chemicals, injections and other human activities in the recharge area. Recharge areas are determined to have a pollution susceptibility of high, medium, or low based on the Hydrologic Atlas 20, Groundwater Pollution Susceptibility Map of Georgia, prepared by the department of natural resources. 
                  Pollution susceptibility maps means maps of relative vulnerability to pollution prepared by the department of natural resources, using the drastic methodology. Pollution susceptibility maps categorize the land areas of the state into areas having high, medium and low groundwater pollution potential. 
                  Recharge area means any portion of the earth's surface where water infiltrates into the ground to replenish an aquifer. 
                  Significant recharge areas means those areas mapped by the department of natural resources in Hydrologic Atlas 18 (1989 edition). Mapping of recharge areas is based on outcrop area, lithology, soil type and thickness, slope, density or lithologic contacts, geologic structure, the presence of karst, and potentiometric surfaces.

As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
                  (2)  A discharge of storm water runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, for each day on which such failure occurs.

                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regarding and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practical erosion potential; 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable;

                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in section 107-107(b)(2) of this article; 
                  (15)  Except as provided in paragraph (16) of this subsection, there is established a 25 foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term 'ephemeral stream' means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow, Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (16)  There is established a 50 foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25 foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines. 
                  (d)  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in section 107-107(b) and (c) of this article. 
                  (e)  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
                  ( Ord. No. 2009-07, § IV, 11-10-2009 ) 
                  Sec. 107-108. - Application/permit process. 
                  (a)  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, storm water management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
                  (b)  Application requirements. 
                  (1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the City of Springfield without first obtaining a permit from the City of Springfield to perform such activity and providing a copy of Notice of Intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
                  (2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the City of Springfield and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in section 107-108(c) of this article. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of section 107-107(b) and (c) of this article will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by three copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
                  (3)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to paragraph (5) subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23, provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  (4)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by section 107-107(c)(15) and (16) has been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per section 107-108(b)(6), have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised Plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised Plan submittal. 
                  (5)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this article section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
                  (6)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this article or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  (c)  Plan requirements. 
                  (1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in section 107-107(b) and (c) of this article, or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this article. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and storm water management facilities, local ordinances and State laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
                  (2)  Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
                  (d)  Permits. 
                  (1)  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
                  (2)  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this article, any variances required by section 107-107(c)(15) and (16) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per section 107-108(b)(6) are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
                  (3)  Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this article, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
                  (4)  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
                  (5)  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this article. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
                  (6)  The LIA may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(f)(1).

                  (a)  The city will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article.

                  (d)  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
                  (e)  The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). The districts or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
                  (f)  The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within 90 days after notification by the division, the division may revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority.

                  Sec. 110-20. - Findings of fact. 
                  (a)  The flood hazard areas of Springfield, Georgia are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (b)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
                  ( Ord. No. 2010-4, 8-24-2010 ) 
                  Sec. 110-21. - Statement of purpose. 
                  It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
                  (4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and, 
                  (5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.

                  (1)  To protect human life and health; 
                  (2)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
                  (3)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; 
                  (4)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
                  (5)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
                  (6)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; and, 
                  (7)  To insure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

                  Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (Note: accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance requirements). For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank.

                  Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a 5-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the "start of construction" of the improvement. Note: The market value of the structure should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
                  For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include (1) those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project, or (2) any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions means where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this article, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article. 
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  (d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided that the criteria of this section are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (g)  In reviewing such requests, the city council shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article. 
                  (h)  Conditions for variances: 
                  (1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause, 
                  b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship, and; 
                  c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  (2)  The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of a historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (4)  The engineer shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to FEMA upon request. 
                  (i)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and/or substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and/or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of the ordinance. 
                  a.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  (2)  Non-residential construction. New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1—30, AE, or AH zones may be flood-proofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the city's engineer as set forth in this article. 
                  (3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
                  a.  All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on: (1) individual lots or parcels, (2) in new and/or substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, (3) in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or (4) on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as a result of a flood must have the lowest floor including basement elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  b.  Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
                  1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation, or 
                  2.  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
                  c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. 
                  d.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
                  1.  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; 
                  2.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions); or 
                  3.  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "new construction," including the anchoring and elevation requirements of items a. and c., above. 
                  (4)  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in this article may be areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted provided that it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
                  b.  Any new construction or substantial improvement allowed in accordance with subsection a. above shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this article.

                  (a)  Approval of material change in appearance in historic districts or involving historic properties. After the designation by ordinance of a historic property or a historic district, no material change in the appearance of such historic property, or of a contributing or noncontributing building, structure, site or object within such historic district, shall be made or be permitted to be made by the owner or occupant thereof, unless or until the application for a certificate of appropriateness has been submitted to and approved by the commission.

                  (1)  Holding public hearing. The commission shall hold a public hearing at which each proposed certificate of appropriateness is discussed. Notice of the hearing shall be published in the principal newspaper of local circulation in the city and written notice of the hearing shall be mailed by the commission to all owners and occupants of the subject property.

                  (2)  Notice to abutting owners. Prior to reviewing an application for a certificate of appropriateness, the commission shall take such action as may reasonably be required to inform the owners of any property likely to be affected materially by the application and shall give the applicant and such owners the opportunity to be heard. At a minimum, this provision shall be construed to require written notice of the time and date of the meeting of the commission at which the application will be considered, to all owners of property abutting the subject property, as shown on the county or city tax records, mailed no less than ten days preceding the date of the commission's meeting at which the relevant certificate of appropriateness is to be considered. 
                  (3)  Right to be heard. The commission shall give the property owner and/or applicant an opportunity to be heard at the certificate of appropriateness hearing.

                  (2)  Types of decision. 
                  a.  Approval. When considering an application for a certificate of appropriateness, the commission shall approve the application and issue a certificate of appropriateness if it finds that the proposed material change in appearance would not have a substantial adverse effect on the historic or architectural significance or value of the designated historic property or designated historic district. In its review of applications for certificates of appropriateness, the commission shall not consider interior arrangements or uses having no effect on exterior architectural features. 
                  b.  Approval with conditions. If the commission identifies elements of a proposed material change in appearance which are not in compliance with the review criteria, the commission may make recommendations or set such conditions and/or changes which render the application for a certificate of appropriateness in compliance, thereby avoiding a substantial adverse effect on the historic or architectural significance or value of the designated historic property or designated historic district. If the applicant agrees to such conditions and/or changes, the commission shall approve the application with such conditions and/or changes, and issue a certificate of appropriateness incorporating said conditions and/or changes. 
                  c.  Table/withdrawal. If the commission is unable to make an informed decision because it finds the application incomplete, the required supporting materials insufficient, or the applicant unavailable to answer pertinent queries, the commission shall table the application for not more than seven days and give the applicant the opportunity to provide the required additional information. If the applicant fails to submit the requested information within said period, the application is to be considered withdrawn without prejudice. The applicant, if he so desires, may resubmit the application for the next regular meeting. 
                  d.  Denial. When considering an application for a certificate of appropriateness, the commission shall deny the application if it finds that the proposed material change in appearance is not in compliance with the review criteria and will have a substantial adverse effect on the historic or architectural significance or value of the designated historic property or designated historic district. The commission may suggest alternative courses of action it thinks proper if it disapproves of the application submitted. The applicant, if he so desires, may make modifications to the plans and resubmit the application at any time after doing so. 
                  (g)  Review criteria. In making its determination on an application for a certificate of appropriateness, the commission shall consider, in addition to any other pertinent factors, the following criteria for each of the following acts: 
                  (1)  Reconstruction, alteration, new construction or renovation. When considering an application for a certificate of appropriateness, the commission shall be guided by the Secretary of the Interior's standards for rehabilitation along with any other design guidelines, criteria and policy statements adopted by the commission. The commission shall evaluate the application for any potential substantial adverse effect on the historic or architectural significance or value of the designated historic property or designated historic district. The commission shall consider, in addition to any other pertinent factors, the historical and architectural value and significance; architectural style; general design, arrangement, texture and materials of the architectural features involved; and the relationship thereof to the exterior architectural style and pertinent features of other structures in the immediate neighborhood. New construction shall conform in orientation, setback, scale, form, design, materials, landscaping and environmental features to the visual and historic character of the designated historic property or designated historic district specified in the commission's design guidelines, criteria and policy statements. 
                  (2)  Relocation. A decision by the commission approving or denying a certificate of appropriateness for the relocation of a building, structure, or object shall be guided by the following: 
                  a.  For both: 
                  1.  Relocations of a building, structure, or object onto a designated historic property or into a designated historic district; and 
                  2.  Relocations off of a designated historic property or out of a designated historic district; 
                  the historic character and aesthetic interest the building, structure or object contributes to its present setting; 
                  b.  Specific to relocation of a building, structure, or object onto a designated historic property or into a designated historic district: 
                  1.  Whether or not such relocation will comply with the design criteria for new construction; and 
                  2.  Whether the proposed relocation area is compatible with the historical and architectural character of the building, structure, site or object; 
                  c.  Specific to relocation of a historic building, structure, or object off of a designated historic property or out of a designated historic district: 
                  1.  Whether or not such relocation will comply with the criteria set forth for review of demolition review herein; 
                  2.  Whether there are definite plans for the area to be vacated and what the effect of those plans on the character of the surrounding area will be; and 
                  3.  Whether the building, structure or object can be moved without significant damage to its physical integrity. 
                  (3)  Demolition. 
                  a.  Criteria. A decision by the commission approving or denying a certificate of appropriateness for the demolition of buildings, structures, or objects, judged to be 50 years old or older, shall be guided by the following criteria: 
                  1.  The historic, scenic or architectural significance of the building, structure, or object; 
                  2.  The importance of the building, structure, or object to the ambiance of a district; 
                  3.  The difficulty or the impossibility of reproducing such a building, structure, or object because of its design, texture, material, detail, or unique location; 
                  4.  Whether the building, structure, or object is one of the last remaining examples of its kind in the neighborhood or city; 
                  5.  Whether the building, structure, or object is of such old, unusual or uncommon design, craftsmanship, texture or material that it could not be reproduced or could be reproduced only with great difficulty; 
                  6.  Whether retention of the building, structure, or object would increase property values, promote business, create positions, attract tourists, students, writers, historian, artists and artisans, attract new residents, encourage study and interest in American, regional, or local history, stimulate interest and study in architecture, educate citizens in American culture and heritage or make the municipality a more attractive and desirable place to live; 
                  7.  Whether there are definite plans for use of the property if the proposed demolition is carried out, and what the effect of those plans on the character of the surrounding area would be; 
                  8.  Whether reasonable measures can be taken to save the building, structure, or object from collapse or continued deterioration; 
                  9.  Whether the building, structure, or object is capable of earning reasonable economic return on its value; 
                  10.  Whether the applicant would consent to the removal and reuse of certain important features of the building, structure, or object. 
                  b.  Post-demolition plans. The commission shall not approve applications without reviewing at the same time post-demolition plans. 
                  c.  Condition documented. Applications for demolition shall include current and archival photographs of the interior and exterior of the building and drawings to document the condition of the building. 
                  d.  Notice. Before a demolition permit may be issued, notice of a proposed demolition shall be given as follows: for a contributing building, structure or object in a historic district, and any building, structure, or object located on a historic property, three months; and for a noncontributing building, structure, or object in a historic district, one month. Conspicuous notice shall be posted on the premises of the building or structure proposed for demolition in a location clearly visible from the public right-of-way. The purpose of this section is to further the purposes of this section by preserving historic buildings which are important to the education, culture, traditions and economic values of the city, and to give the city's interested persons, historical societies, organizations, or any other entity the opportunity to acquire or arrange for the preservation of such buildings. The commission may at any time during such delay period approve a certificate of appropriateness for demolition, in which event a demolition permit shall be issued without further delay. Further, nothing in this section shall be construed to impair or limit the power of the city to demolish or allow demolition of any building or structure in the event of an emergency or in the interest of public safety or welfare. 
                  (h)  Undue hardship. When, by reason of unusual circumstances, the strict application of any provision of this chapter would result in the exceptional practical difficulty or undue economic hardship upon any owner of a specific property, the commission, in passing upon applications, shall have the power to vary or modify strict provisions, so as to relieve such difficulty or hardship; provided such variances, modifications or interpretations shall remain in harmony with the general purpose and intent of said provisions, so that the architectural or historical integrity, or character of the property, shall be conserved and substantial justice done. In granting variances, the commission may impose such reasonable and additional stipulations and conditions as will, in its judgment, best fulfill the purpose of this chapter. An undue hardship shall not be a situation of the person's own making. 
                  (i)  Deadline for approval or rejection of application for certificate of appropriateness. 
                  (1)  The commission shall approve, with or without changes and/or conditions, or reject an application for a certificate of appropriateness within 45 days after the filing thereof by the owner or occupant of a historic property, building structure, site, or object located within a historic district. Evidence of approval shall be by a certificate of appropriateness issued by the commission. Notice of the issuance or denial of a certificate of appropriateness shall be sent by United States mail to the applicant and all other persons who have requested such notice in writing filed with the commission. 
                  (2)  Failure of the commission to act within 45 days shall constitute approval, and no other evidence of approval shall be needed. 
                  (j)  Necessary action to be taken by commission upon rejection of application for certificate of appropriateness. 
                  (1)  In the event the commission rejects an application, it shall state its reasons for doing so, and shall transmit a record of such actions and reasons, in writing, to the applicant. The commission may suggest alternative courses of action it thinks proper if it disapproves of the application submitted. The applicant, if he so desires, may make modifications to the plans and resubmit the application at any time after doing so. 
                  (2)  Binding on municipal officials; building permits. In cases where the application covers a material change in the appearance of a structure which would require the issuance of a building permit, the denial of the application for a certificate of appropriateness by the commission shall be binding upon the building official or his designee or other administrative officer charged with issuing building permits and, in such a case, no building permit shall be issued. 
                  (k)  Notification of decision by commission. 
                  (1)  Mayor and city council. The commission shall provide a list of decisions to the mayor and city council, and in instances of denials, shall provide to the mayor and council a copy of the notification of the applicant.

                  (l)  Requirement of conformance with certificate of appropriateness. 
                  (1)  All work performed pursuant to an issued certificate of appropriateness shall conform to the requirements of such certificate. In the event work is performed not in accordance with such certificate, the commission shall issue a cease and desist order and all work shall cease. 
                  (2)  The commission and the city council shall be authorized to institute any appropriate action or proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent any material change in appearance of a designated historic property or historic district, except those changes made in compliance with the provisions of this chapter or to prevent any illegal act or conduct with respect to such historic property or historic district. 
                  (m)  Certificate of appropriateness void if construction not commenced. A certificate of appropriateness shall become void unless construction is commenced within six months of the date of issuance. A certificate of appropriateness shall permit work in compliance thereof for a period of 12 months from the date of issuance, and is renewable for an additional period of six months upon submission of a request by the owner and issuance of written approval by the commission. 
                  (n)  Recording an application for certificate of appropriateness. The commission shall keep a public record of all applications for certificates of appropriateness, and all the commission's proceedings in connection with said applications. 
                  (o)  Failure to apply for a certificate of appropriateness. A certificate of appropriateness shall be obtained prior to any material change in the appearance, including, but not limited to, new construction, additions, restoration, rehabilitation, renovation, remodeling, alterations, site changes, demolition or relocation. In the event work is performed without a certificate of appropriateness, the building official or his designee shall issue a stop work order and all work shall cease. No person shall undertake any work on such project as long as such stop work order shall continue in effect. The owner shall submit an application for a certificate of appropriateness within seven days of the issuance of the stop work order. At its next regular meeting, the commission shall review the application without prejudice, as if no work had been completed. Violations of this subsection shall be punished as provided for herein. 
                  (p)  Acquisition of property. The commission may, where such action is authorized by the city council and is reasonably necessary or appropriate for the preservation of a unique historic property, enter into negotiations with the owner for the acquisition by gift, purchase, exchange, or otherwise, to the property or any interest therein. 
                  (q)  Appeals. Any person adversely affected by any determination made by the commission relative to the issuance or denial of a certificate of appropriateness may appeal such determination to the city council. Any such appeal must be filed with the city council within 15 days after the issuance of the determination pursuant to subsection (i)(1) of this section or, in the case of a failure of the commission to act, within 15 days of the expiration of the 45-day period allowed for commission action, as provided by subsection (i)(2) of this section. Appeals for properties within the city shall be made to the city council. The city council may approve, modify, or reject the determination made by the commission, if the city council finds that the commission abused its discretion in reaching its decision. Appeals from decisions of the city council may be taken to the superior court of the county in the manner provided by law for appeals from conviction for city ordinance violations, namely via petition for writ of certiorari.

Ordinary maintenance or repair of any exterior architectural or environmental feature in or on a historic property to correct deterioration, decay, or to sustain the existing form, and that does not involve a material change in design, material or outer appearance thereof, does not require a certificate of appropriateness. 
                  (b)  Failure to provide ordinary maintenance or repair. Property owners of individual properties within a designated historic district or of designated historic properties shall not allow their buildings to deteriorate by failing to provide ordinary maintenance or repair through deliberate or inadvertent neglect. The commission shall be charged with the following responsibilities regarding deterioration by neglect: 
                  (1)  The commission shall monitor the condition of historic properties and existing buildings and structures in historic districts to determine if they are being allowed to deteriorate by neglect. Such conditions as broken windows, doors and exterior openings which allow the elements and vermin to enter, or the deterioration of a building's structural system, shall constitute failure to provide ordinary maintenance or repair. 
                  (2)  In the event the commission determines a failure to provide ordinary maintenance or repair, the commission shall notify the property owner and any other person who may have legal custody and control thereof in writing, via certified mail, return receipt requested, sent to the most recent address of the owner on record with the tax authorities of the county, and set forth in reasonable particularity the steps which need to be taken to remedy the situation. Such notification shall also inform the recipient of the right to appeal set forth herein. 
                  (3)  In the event the situation is not remedied in 60 days, the owner shall be punished as provided in this chapter, or at the direction of the city council, the commission may perform such maintenance or repair as is necessary to prevent deterioration by neglect. The property owner shall be liable for the cost of such maintenance or repair. The cost of such maintenance or repair shall be a lien against the real property. The lien shall attach to the real property at the time of payment of all costs of maintenance or repair by the city. 
                  (4)  Any such notification sent by the commission under this section may be appealed to the city council within 15 days of receipt. The city council shall rescind such a notification only if it finds that the commission had no substantial justification for requiring action to be taken, or that the measures required were not reasonable under all of the circumstances. The taking of an appeal to the city council shall not operate to suspend any notification requiring buildings or structures to be secured or requiring temporary support, unless the city council expressly suspends such notification. The city council shall seek preliminary and permanent relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce any such notification. 
                  (5)  Nothing in this section shall be construed to impair or limit in any way the power of the city to define and declare nuisances and to cause their removal or abatement by summary proceedings or otherwise. 
                  (c)  Affirmation of existing building and zoning codes. Nothing in this chapter shall be constructed so as to exempt property owners from complying with existing city building and zoning codes, nor prevent any property owner from making any use of his property not prohibited by other statutes, ordinances or regulations.

                  DIVISION 2. - APPROVAL PROCEDURES 

                  Sec. 116-67. - Steps. 
                  The procedure for review and approval of a subdivision plat consists of five separate steps. These are: 
                  (1)  Pre-design plan review. 
                  (2)  Engineering and design review. 
                  (3)  Review and approval of the preliminary plat. 
                  (4)  Site prep and construction of infrastructure. 
                  (5)  Review and approval of the final plat. 
                  Step (1), (2) and (3) shall be completed prior to making any street improvements, installing any utilities. Step (4) and (5) shall be completed prior to the sale of any lots in the proposed subdivision. The provisions of this division shall be followed in the submission, review, and action upon all subdivision plats. 
                  (Ord. No. 2019-09 , § 1(Exh. A), 7-9-2019) 
                  Sec. 116-68. - Pre-design plan review procedures. 
                  Prior to the submission of engineering and design documents, the developer shall submit to the Building and Zoning Department a plan of the proposed subdivision. Included with the sketch plan should be a map which shows the subdivision in relation to the surrounding area. The developer should submit plans for to property to be subdivide, including proposed zoning changes (if any), lots dimensions and street locations. The purpose of the plan is to assist the subdivider prior to extensive site planning necessary for the preparation of the preliminary plat, and to become familiar with the regulations affecting the land to be subdivided. The Building and Zoning Official shall consult with the public works department to review the plans and will approve, disapprove, or approve with modification the plan review submission in writing. 
                  (Ord. No. 2019-09 , § 1(Exh. A), 7-9-2019) 
                  Sec. 116-69. - Engineering and design review. 
                  (a)  After approval of the plan review submission, the developer shall begin design of the subdivision development as indicated in the plan review and submit for approval the engineering and design files to the Building and Zoning Department. The submission shall be submitted in print (two copies) and digital format and will be reviewed for compliance with development design standards and zoning regulations as well as the adequacy of the water, sewer and road infrastructure. After review, comments will be submitted to the developer in writing within 20 days of the original submission. Each additional revision will be reviewed, and comments returned in the same manner. 
                  (b)  Once approved the Building and Zoning Department shall issue a final approval letter and the preliminary plat can be submitted to city council. Failure to submit a preliminary plat within six months of the engineering and design final approval letter will void the approval and the approval must be applied for again. 
                  (Ord. No. 2019-09 , § 1(Exh. A), 7-9-2019) 
                  Sec. 116-70. - Preliminary plat procedures. 
                  (a)  Once the engineer and design files have been approved, the developer will have six months to present to city council the preliminary subdivision plat. Preliminary plat review fees are due at the time of submission. The preliminary plat will show the intended subdivision of the property and should be submitted in the same manner and format as the final plat. The purpose of the preliminary plat submission is for the developer to have formal approval of the lots to be subdivided and the roads to be constructed before beginning construction. Preliminary plat approval is not an effectual subdivision property or dedication of streets. 
                  (b)  Application for preliminary approval of a subdivision plat shall be submitted to the secretary of the city council at least 15 days prior to the regularly scheduled meeting date of the city council. The plat of the subdivision shall be submitted in print and digital format and shall be such as to meet the minimum requirements contained herein. Any preliminary plat submitted to the city council shall contain the name and address of the subdivider (or his designee) to whom the notice of hearing may be sent; and no preliminary plat shall be acted upon by the city council without affording a hearing thereon, notice of time and place of which shall be sent by registered or certified mail to said address not less than five days before the date fixed therefore. Additional copies of the plat and supplemental information may be requested. 
                  (c)  The city council shall act on the preliminary plat within 30 days after submission and, if approved, shall indicate in writing, stating the conditions of such approval, if any, or if disapproved, shall express in writing its disapproval and its reasons therefor. Failure of the city council to act within 60 days after formal submission of the preliminary plat shall be deemed to constitute approval and a certificate to that effect shall be issued by the city council on demand; provided, however, that the subdivider may waive this requirement and consent in writing to the extension of such period. The action of the council shall be recorded in the minutes of the council meeting. 
                  (d)  Approval of the preliminary plat shall be noted on the plat and certified by the secretary of the city council on authorization by the city council. Also noted shall be the date on which the city council granted preliminary approval and the date of written notification to the subdivider or his authorized agent. Failure of a subdivider to initiate any development within 12 months from the approval of the preliminary plat will require resubmittal of the preliminary plat to the city council for approval. Any additional requirements placed upon the plat that were not placed upon the plat when it was first submitted shall be necessary for inclusion in the final plat. All appropriate fees shall be payable upon resubmission of the plat. 
                  (e)  Approval of the preliminary subdivision plat shall not constitute approval of the final subdivision plat. Preliminary approval shall constitute approval of the proposed widths and alignments of streets and the dimensions and shapes of lots. Application for approval of the final, or record, plat will be considered only after the requirements for final plat approval as specified herein have been fulfilled and after all other specified conditions have been met. Upon approval of the preliminary subdivision plat by the city council, the subdivider may proceed to comply with the other requirements of these regulations and the preparation of the final subdivision plat. 
                  (Ord. No. 2019-09 , § 1(Exh. A), 7-9-2019) 
                  Sec. 116-71. - Final plat procedures. 
                  (a)  Minor subdivisions. 
                  (1)  For minor subdivisions, the final plat may be approved by the zoning administrator following review and approval from all necessary departments. Upon review of a plat that complies with all the requirements of the minor subdivision regulations, including but not limited to zoning district, lot size, access, frontage requirements, and lot requirements as stated in section 116-176, the final plat may be signed by the zoning administrator and mayor. 
                  (2)  At least two prints shall then be made from the original, one to be kept on file with the city, and one to accompany the original which shall be recorded in the office of the clerk of court. Approval of the final plat by the city council shall not be deemed to constitute or effect an acceptance by the city of the dedication of any street or other ground shown upon the plat. 
                  (b)  Intermediate and major subdivisions. 
                  (1)  After completion of the final drawings of all or part of the area as shown on the approved preliminary plat, the subdivider shall submit to the secretary of the city council, prior to the regularly scheduled meeting date of the city council, six black line prints of the final plat prepared in accordance with the provisions of these regulations, along with the required certificates executed by the appropriate officials. 
                  (2)  Any final plat submitted to the city council shall contain the name and address of the subdivider (or his designee) to whom the notice of hearing may be sent, and no final plat shall be acted upon by the city council without affording a hearing thereon, notice of time and place of which shall be sent by registered or certified mail to said address not less than five days before the date fixed therefor. 
                  (3)  Additional copies of the final plat and supplemental information may be requested. The above-mentioned copies shall be distributed as required by this division and additionally as deemed necessary by the secretary of the city council. The person or agency, to which a copy of the final plat is directed, shall indicate any desired changes or comments or its approval on the plat and submit it to the city council prior to the formal presentation of the final plat. 
                  (4)  The city council shall act on the final plat within 30 days after formal submission. Failure to act within that time period shall be deemed to constitute final approval and a certificate to that effect shall be issued by the city council on demand; provided, however, that the subdivider may waive this requirement and consent in writing to the extension of such period. In the event a final plat is disapproved, the grounds for disapproval shall be noted in the minutes provided to the subdivider. Upon the approval of the final plat by the city council, the original linen shall be stamped with the appropriate certificate of the city council. At least two prints shall then be made from the original, one to be kept on file with the city council, and one to accompany the original which shall be recorded in the office of the clerk of court. Approval of the final plat by the city council shall not be deemed to constitute or effect an acceptance by the city of the dedication of any street or other ground shown upon the plat. In no case shall the city council disapprove a final plat of a subdivision which: 
                  a.  Meets the requirements of a final plat as set forth in these regulations; 
                  b.  Conforms to an approved preliminary plat; and 
                  c.  Has all the required improvements installed and approved. 
                  Any additional requirements placed upon the plat that were not placed upon the plat when it was first submitted shall be necessary for inclusion in the final plat. All appropriate fees shall be payable upon resubmission of the plat.

                  Sec. 116-72. - Preliminary plats and engineering not required. 
                  Subdivisions which do not involve the platting, construction or opening of new streets, water or sewer facilities, or improvement of existing streets shall, after the pre-design plan review, be accepted by the Building and Zoning Department in the form of a final plat. Such plat shall comply in all respects with these regulations. Engineer and design review and preliminary plats are not required in such cases.

                  (1)  Subdivision corner tie. At least one corner of the subdivision shall be designated by course and distance (tie) from a readily discernible reference marker. If a corner is within 2,000 feet of a U.S. Coastal and Geodetic Station, U.S. Geological Survey, or state grid system coordinated monument, then this corner shall be marked with a monument so designated by computed X and Y coordinates which shall appear on the map with a statement identifying this station or monument to an accuracy of 1:10,000. When such a monument or station is not available, the tie shall be made to some permanent and readily recognizable landmark or identifiable point, physical object or structure. 
                  (2)  Monuments. 
                  a.  Monuments shall be located in the ground at all angles with in the boundaries of the subdivision; at the intersection lines of streets and at the intersection lines of streets with boundaries of the plat and at the intersection of alleys with the boundaries of the subdivision; at all points of curvature, points of reverse curvature and angle points in the side lines of streets and alleys; and at all angles of an intermediate traverse line. 
                  b.  It is not intended or required that monuments be placed within the traveled portion of a street to mark angles in the boundary of the subdivision if the angle points can be readily reestablished by reference to monuments along the sidelines of the streets. 
                  c.  All required monuments shall be places flush with the ground where practicable. 
                  d.  If the required location of a monument is in an inaccessible place, or where the location of a monument would be clearly impracticable, it is sufficient to place a reference monument nearby and the precise location thereof by clearly indicating on the plat and referencing the true point. 
                  e.  All monuments used shall be made of solid iron or steel bars at least one-half-inch in diameter and 36 inches long and completely encased in concrete at least four inches in diameter, or a suitable alternate approved by a licensed professional surveyor submitting the plat on behalf of subdivider. 
                  f.  If a point required to be monumented is on a bedrock outcropping, a steel rod, at least one-half-inch in diameter, shall be drilled and grouted into solid rock to a depth of at least eight inches. 
                  (3)  Control corners. Within each block of a subdivision at least two monuments designed as control corners shall be installed. All control corners shall be constructed of concrete and shall be at least four inches in diameter or square and not less than three feet in length. Each monument shall have imbedded in its top or attached by a suitable means, a metal plate of noncorrosive materials and marked plainly with the point, the surveyor's registration number, the month and year it was installed and the words "control corner." 
                  (4)  Property markers. A steel or wrought iron pipe or the equivalent not less than three-fourths inches in diameter and at least 30 inches in length shall be set at all corners, except those located by monuments. 
                  (5)  Accuracy. Land surveys, both within the limits of incorporated areas and beyond, shall be at an accuracy of at least 1:7,500.

                  Sec. 116-130. - Number of lots versus improvement standards. 
                  By permitting varying numbers of lots and varying levels of improvement, regulations enable the small developer to lower the lot absorption rate. Less restrictive development standards are imposed according to the quantity of lots to allow for flexibility in subdivision sizes. If at a later date a subdivision is expanded in the opinion of the city council, the existing lots shall be counted when determining the number of lots upon which required improvements are based.

                  Sec. 116-131. - Required improvements. 
                  A well-designed subdivision means little to a prospective lot buyer until he can see actual physical transformation of raw land into lots with all necessary improvements provided. Likewise, a well-designed subdivision is not an asset to the community until the necessary improvements have been installed. In order that prospective lot purchasers may get useable products and new subdivisions may be an asset rather than a liability to the community, the subdivider shall install and/or pay for the improvements required by these regulations necessary to serve his subdivision prior to the approval of the final plat.

                  When gas lines are located in a street right-of-way, where possible, such lines shall be located outside the portion of the street to be surfaced to prevent having to cut into the paved surface to serve abutting properties.

                  Sec. 116-133. - Water supply. 
                  If a water system is installed in a subdivision, water mains, valves, and fire hydrants shall be installed according to plans and specifications approved by and in accordance with the rules and administrative regulations of the county health department. When the water main is located in the street surface to serve the abutting lots, a connection shall be stubbed out to the property line to serve each lot before the street is surfaced.

When the sewer line is located in a street right-of-way and it will be necessary to cut into the street surface to serve the abutting lots, a connection shall be stubbed out to the property line to serve each lot prior to surfacing the street.

                  Sec. 116-173. - Streets. 
                  (a)  Conformity to existing maps or plans. The location and width of all proposed streets shall be in conformity with official plans and maps with existing amended plans of the city council. A traffic safety study shall be completed before approval of all exit streets. 
                  (b)  Continuation of adjoining street system. The proposed street layout shall be coordinated with the street system of the surrounding area. Where possible, existing major streets shall be extended. 
                  (c)  Access to adjacent properties. Where it is desirable to provide for street access to adjoining property, proposed streets shall be extended by dedication to the boundary of such property and a temporary turnaround shall be provided. 
                  (d)  Street names. Proposed streets, which are obviously in alignment with other existing and named streets, shall bear the assigned name of the existing streets. In no case shall the name of the proposed streets duplicate or be phonetically similar to existing street names, irrespective of the use of suffix, street, avenue, boulevard, drive, place, court, etc. It shall be unlawful for any person in laying out any new street or road to name such street or road on any plat, by marking, or in any deed or instrument, without first getting approval of the city council. 
                  (e)  Minor street. Minor streets shall be so laid out that their use by through traffic will be discouraged. 
                  (f)  Trees. It is recommended that as many trees as possible remain on the site during the initial clearing and grading and that all trees having a trunk diameter of six inches or more, measured four feet above the ground, shall remain unless they lie within the necessary paved areas surrounding or adjacent to the primary structure. 
                  (g)  Railroads and highways (freeways, expressways). Railroad right-of-way and limited access highways where so located as to affect the subdivision of adjoining land shall be treated as follows: 
                  (1)  In residential districts a buffer strip not less than 25 feet in depth in addition to the normal depth of the lot required in the district shall be paved adjacent to the railroad right-of-way or limited access highway. This strip shall be part of the platted lots and shall be so designated on the plat: "This strip is reserved for the planting of trees and shrubs by the owner. The placement of structures hereon is prohibited." 
                  (2)  In districts zoned for business, commercial, or industrial uses, the nearest street extending parallel or approximately parallel to the railroad shall, wherever practicable, be at a sufficient distance therefrom to ensure suitable depth for commercial or industrial sites. 
                  (3)  All other streets which are parallel to the railroad, when intersecting a street which crosses the railroad at grade shall, to the extent practicable, be at a distance of at least 150 feet from the railroad right-of-way. Such distance shall be determined with due consideration of the minimum distance required for future separation of grades by means of appropriate approach gradients. 
                  (h)  Reserved strips prohibited. Reserved strips at the terminus of a new street shall be prohibited. 
                  (i)  Street jogs. Street jogs with centerline offsets by less than 200 feet shall be prohibited.

Temporary dead-end streets shall be provided with a turnaround having a 30-foot radius. 
                  (l)  Alleys. Service alleys or drives may be required in multiple dwellings and commercial and industrial developments and shall have a minimum surface treatment width of 15 feet, but shall not be provided in one-family and two-family residential developments unless the subdivider provides evidence satisfactory to the city council of the need for alleys. 
                  (m)  Street right-of-way widths. Minimum street right-of-way widths shall be as follows: 
                  (1)  Curb and gutter. See Exhibit E for illustration. 

                   
                  (2)  Shoulder. See Exhibit E for illustration. 

                   
                  Notes: 
                  (1) Except for local streets, pavement widths shown do not provide for on-street parking; service lanes are intended only for the loading and unloading of passengers and goods and for disabled vehicles and are not for the storage of vehicles. 
                  (2) Right-of-way (henceforth referred to as R/W) width listed is for only that portion of the typical section between the limits indicated in the diagram. Sloping rights of additional R/W will be required for cut and fill slopes outside these limits; these future slope areas beyond indicated R/W limits should also be kept clear of development until slopes have been constructed. 
                  (3) R/W widths greater than the minimum are encouraged because they make for a safer, more aesthetic and more comfortable facility and permit future roadway widening without disrupting abutting property. 
                  (4) All sidewalks shall be 48 inches wide and installed by builders after completion of construction. 
                  (5) Individual homeowners shall be responsible for the maintenance of area/grass between streets and sidewalk adjoining their property. 
                  (6) Landscaping and maintenance of entrances to subdivisions shall be done by the developer or homeowners' associations. 
                  (n)  Sight distance for vertical curves. Where vertical curves are used, the minimum sight distance shall be as follows: 

                   
                  (o)  Horizontal curves. Where a deflection angle of more than ten degrees occurs in the alignment of a marginal access of a minor street or road, a curve of reasonable radius shall be introduced. A curve shall be introduced at any change in direction of a collector, industrial, or commercial service street or major thoroughfare. On major thoroughfares the centerline radius of curvature shall be determined by the state department of transportation or the city or county engineer. On collector, industrial or commercial service streets, the centerline radius of curvature shall not be less than 350 feet. On minor streets, the centerline radius of curvature shall not be less than 150 feet unless the topography of the land to be subdivided makes this impractical. 
                  (p)  Street grades. Grades on major thoroughfares shall be established by the state department of transportation or county engineers. Grades on collector streets shall not exceed eight percent unless topographic conditions make this impractical. Grades on minor residential streets shall not exceed 15 percent, unless topographic conditions make this impractical. All streets shall have a minimum grade of not less than one-half of one percent.

                  3.7 - "DT" Downtown District. 
                  Purpose: Springfield seeks to regulate infill development and to preserve, promote and support the revitalization of its traditional city core. History demonstrates that a few traditional urban design conventions will generate building types and neighborhood forms which allow profitable, positive infill and change, which strengthen property values and appearance, and which offer a high quality of life. This District establishes new standards for land development in order to: 
                  i.  Preserve and extend the historic neighborhood character through the design and placement of building types and public spaces; 
                  ii.  Create high-quality street spaces by using buildings to form an interesting and safe environment that works for pedestrians, bicyclists and motorists; 
                  iii.  Enhance the viability of local businesses and reduce travel demand by focusing growth in appropriate locations accessible to pedestrians; 
                  iv.  Provide a measure of predictability to property owners and occupants about what may be built on their land or that of their neighbors, yet allow for a market-driven mixture of land uses; and 
                  v.  Promote and protect pedestrian activity and reduce the impacts of vehicle traffic traversing crosswalks and sidewalks at driveways. 
                  3.7.1 General Location. The boundaries of the DT District generally extend along Laurel Street from Jack's Branch to the branch south of Old Stillwell Road, and from Pine Street to the railroad right-of-way paralleling Railroad Avenue.

                  3.8 - "PUD" Planned Unit Development District. 
                  The purpose of a PUD district is to provide that the public health, safety, and welfare be furthered in an area of increasing urbanization and growing demand for housing of all types and design: to ensure that the enacted zoning ordinance provisions encourage innovations in residential and non-residential development and redevelopment so that the growing demand for housing and commercial areas may be met by a greater variety in type, design and layout of buildings and by the conservation and more efficient use of land and of public services and to reflect changes in the technology of land development so the economies secured may add to the benefit of those who need homes; and, in the aid of these purposes to provide a procedure which can relate the type, design and layout of residential and non-residential development to the particular site and the particular demand for housing and commercial activity existing at the time of development in a manner consistent with the preservation of the property values within existing areas, and to ensure that the increased flexibility of regulations over land development authorized here is carried out under such administrative standards and procedures as shall encourage the disposition of proposals for land development without undue delay. 
                  It is the intent that a planned unit development be established by rezoning the applicable property to the PUD district and by simultaneously approving the preliminary development plan (with conditions and required modifications). Thereafter development will be guided by the provisions of the development plan (and attachments) for the specific project. 
                  Uses permitted within a planned unit development: 
                  i.  Residential uses, including single family, two-family, and multi-family dwellings. 
                  ii.  Commercial uses of a type, size, and location designed to be compatible with the proposed residential development. 
                  iii.  Other accessory of ancillary uses as are permitted in residential areas and conditional uses identified in standard zoning districts. Conditional uses may be specifically shown on the approved development plan or may later permitted through the conditional use permit approval process.

The standards established for truck-tractors, semi-trailers, truck-tractor and semi-trailer combinations or trucks in this section are designed to regulate their parking within all zoning districts in the City. With the deregulation of the trucking industry and subsequent increase of independent truckers, parking of trucks throughout the City could become a nuisance and unsightly. In addition, to unsightliness, is the concern for potential damage to residential streets, which are not designed to carry these loads. It is the purpose of this subsection to regulate truck-tractor, semitrailer, truck-tractor and semi-trailer combinations or truck parking to eliminate those conditions which are a nuisance, unsightly and cause the deterioration of property and property values.

                  5.5 - Variances. 
                  Applicability : Certain cases which request variances from the terms of the ordinance as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the ordinance or resolution will, in an individual case, result in unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of the ordinance or resolution shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done and make a recommendation to the City Council. Such variance may be granted in such individual case of unnecessary hardship upon a finding by the City Council that: 
                  5.5.1 There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape, or topography; 
                  5.5.2 The application of the ordinance or resolution to this particular piece of property would create an unnecessary hardship; 
                  5.5.3 Such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of property involved; and 
                  5.5.4 Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purpose and intent of the ordinance or resolution, provided, however, that no variance may be granted for a use of land or building or structure that is prohibited by the ordinance. 
                  5.5.5 The fact that a property owner will suffer financial hardship if not granted a special exception or a variance from the zoning ordinance, is of itself insufficient ground for granting a variance. 
                  In exercising the above powers, the City Council may, in conformity with the provisions of the ordinance, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken and may issue or direct the issuance of a permit. 
                  5.5.6 Court Review. Any person or persons severally or jointly aggrieved by any decision of the City Council may take an appeal to the Superior Court. Said appeal to the Superior Court shall be the same as an appeal to the Superior Court form any decision made by the Judge of the Probate Court as specified in Chapter 6-2 of the Code of Georgia, except, however, that said appeal may be filed within 30 days from the date of the decision of the City Council, and upon failure to file said appeal within 30 days, the said decision of City Council shall be final. Provided, however, that on appeal said case shall be heard by the Judge of the Superior Court without a jury unless one of the parties files a written demand for a jury trial within 30 days form the filing of the appeal. 
                  5.6 - Rezoning. 
                  In exercising its zoning powers, the mayor and council shall balance the interest in promoting the public health, safety, morality, and general welfare against the right to the unrestricted use of property. The Mayor and Council thus shall consider the following factors prior to exercising the zoning power: 
                  5.6.1 Is this request a logical extension of a zoning boundary which would improve the pattern of uses in the general area? 
                  5.6.2 Is this proposed zoning generally related to either existing zoning or the pattern of development of the area? 
                  5.6.3 Whether the zoning decision will result in a use, which will or could cause an excessive or burdensome use of existing streets, transportation facilities, utilities or schools 
                  5.6.4 Will this request place irreversible limitations or cause material detriment on the area similarly zoned as it is or on future plans for it? 
                  5.6.5 Is there an imminent need for the rezoning and is the property likely to be used for the use requested? 
                  5.6.6 Would the proposed use precipitate similar requests which would generate or accelerate adverse land use changes in the zone or neighborhood? 
                  5.7 - Conditional Use Permit for Uses Not Defined. 
                  5.7.1 Where a use is not listed as either a permitted use or a conditional use in this ordinance, it may be permitted as a conditional use pursuant to the procedures and criteria in Section 5.4, subject to the following: 
                  5.7.1.1 The use shall be similar in character to other uses permitted in the district either by right or by conditional use permit. In considering the similarity in character, consideration shall be given to noise, odors, smoke, dust, traffic impacts, demand on public facilities and utilities, and other potential impacts. 
                  5.7.1.2 The use shall not be prohibited use in any district. 
                  5.8 - Special Exemptions. 
                  Applicability . In certain instances special exceptions may be authorized by City Council subject to the following criteria and conditions: 
                  5.8.1 A special exception shall be a reasonable modification of the restrictions and limitations in this ordinance and will not derogate from the intent of the zoning district within which the property is located or cause unreasonable injury to other properties. 
                  5.8.2 A special exception will not permit a use not otherwise permitted in the district and will not violate the terms of City's adopted Comprehensive Plan. 
                  5.8.3 In approving a special exception, the City Council may place reasonable conditions on the use or development of the property so as to mitigate any possible adverse impacts of the proposed development. Any violation of such conditions shall void the special exception.
